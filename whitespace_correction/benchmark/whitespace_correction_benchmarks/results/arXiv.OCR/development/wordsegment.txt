At microwave frequencies where complex reflection and transmission measurements (S-parameter) are common, it is difficult to characterize bi anisotropic materials. This difficulty stems from l he fact that these materi c~ls are necessarily described by the most general form of the constitutive relations. There may be 36 complex quantities to determine, and thus standard complex reflection and transmission measurements yield incomplete EMilfars)mataAtTHz and higher frequencies where phase sensitive measurements are not common it is even more difficult, although methods such as ellipsome-try or THz time domain spectroscopy may prove use-ful. Further since a magnetic and electric resonant response enter similarly into the Fresnel equations, it is dil-ficult to determine the origin of the response. Typically, artificial magnetic meta materials are constructed from conducting elements, and thus a full electromagnetic characterization is a necessity, since an electric response is unavoidable. Analytical theories have yi is ld ed equations able to predict the resonant frequency ω0 and plasma frequency ωp of meta materials. However there is a lack of suitable analytical methods capa-ble of determining the many varying and complicated EM properties. Simulation is still heavily relied upon and, as of yet, is still unable to determine and distinguishing bi anisotropic response.

If we wish to generalise further, we need to develop the analogues of the uniqueness of the Jordan algebra. The proof we had in the separable case rested upon the uniqueness of the Cantor algebra. In the higher-dimensional case we can not hope for that, but perhaps we can obtain uniqueness restricted to algebras that have the same dense set.

In summary, an ultra low temperature point contact set up using nano positioners was used to measure differential resistance of W/SR O point contact junctions. We find: 1)a superconducting gap around 0.2mVandadome like shape of conductance enhancement, consistent with chiralp-wavesymmetry;2)SC-like features persist igupto6.2K, much higher than the bulk Tc of SRO, presumably due to the pressure exerted by the Wt ip and a mechanism similar to that of the 3K-phase;3) abroad resistance hump coexist-ing with superconductivity, which is ascribed to density of states effect due to 2D electron-electron interaction, consistent with the highly anisotropic electronic system of SRO. We believe PCS may provide useful information beyond the surface problem for SRO.

After identifying the plausible alignments to V-an dJ-genes, we turn to the problem of identifying D-gene matches. This is a more difficult problem because the D-genes are short, and deletions (occurring on both ends) often leave residual sequences which are hard to identify a saD-gene fragment. We therefore put very loose con-straints on the D-gene alignments, relying on the probabilistic refinement to narrow them down. Specifically, we consider the read sequence segment lying between the end of the highest-scoring V-gene and the end of the highest-scoring J-gene,?ndinclode0 nucleotides of flank-ing sequence on either side, to allow for ambiguous origin of these bases. We identify as a possible D-gene match every maximal non-verla pp nc alignment to this segment of the three D-gene alleles. These D-gene matches are scored by their length and the top 200 are selected as possible D-gene alignments.

Two typ-ical sequences can be identified in the abundances of the various clusters: d, t,h,αat low baryonic density and d, t,α,hat the higher total baryonic density at which clus-ters are still present. Deviations from this behavior are found for lower temperature (T=3.5MeV) or higher proton fraction (Ypg=0.5). In general, the dominant contribution comes from the deuterons. At very low density, the sequence reflects the ordering in size: the smaller clusters are more abundant. The difference b,e tvet tt and h,and more precisely the finding that tritons are more abundant than he lions, is due to two effects: globally there are more neutrons available and, ll lore oveR, the triton is more bound. This last point explains why we find a difference among them also atYpg=0.5.

This fact strongly supports the correctness of the off-equilibrium approach for the computation of the q=0 component of the propagator (including the effectiveness of the extrapolation procedure) and confirms that it is possible to com-pute equilibrium expectation values in off-equilibrium simulations. Moreover the double peak structure of the correlation function probability distribution survives in the infinite volume limit since the dynamical expectation values have been computed on a very large lattice (infinite to all practical effects). It is remarkable that the distribution probability of C(x) becomes wider with increasing x.

The second taskwi3l require systems to associate GeneOntology (GO) terms with mentions of proteins in arti-cles curated in the SWISS-PROT database. Our experience in organizing the KDD competition leads us to believe that by using data from curated databases and focusing on tasks of immediate utility both to database curators and to researchers, we can define a good challenge evaluation for text data mining systems.

We have found the zero-temperature phase diagram of a physical system whose relevant dynamics is captured by a nonlinear sigma model with aDzyaloshinskii-Moriya term and a Zeeman coupling to an external magnetic field. This dynamics corresponds to the continuous limit of an chiral ferromagnet on a square lattice.

A particular form for the function y (φ)motivated by particle physics considerations could now be chosen and an estimate for the energy scale at the end of inflation deduced. However, given the enhanced ac-curacy of recent CMB measurements, it-is of more interest to consider what observations may reveal about the under-lying inflationary model. We therefore explore this possibility in the following ~ ec?tion.

The next step to our approach is to examine each node in terms of its possibility to be reached. Infeasible situations could be happened as thc bounding boxes of objects in the scene may not be able to perfectly fit these structures and they often have irregular non-convex shapes. In addition, it is possible some obstacles and stable structures such as mountains, to be inserted between the slingshot and the target. Therefore, an exam-ination step is required at each node so as to ensure that the corresponding ra\]e c tOlls can reach the target.
Finally, we recall the IMB H model which has spectral support from some sources (Miller etal2004; the level of absorption in NGC1275 is too high for any soft excess to be observed). They may form in dense star clusters.

This definition is a natural generalization of the Riemannian normal homogeneous space. Although in most cases the normal homogeneity is only referred to a compact coset space M=G/Hofacompactf,i.6e group ~, the theory can be applied to some special non-compact coset spaces with very minor technical adjustment. Note that if Gis acn mp.act simple Lie group, then there exists a \ nique bi-invariant Riemannian metric onG (up to homo the ties). However, there usually exists infinitely many bi-invariant Finsler metrics on a compact Lie group (up to homo the ties), even for a compact simple Lie group. This implies that normal homogeneous Finsler metrics are not related to the group Gas closely as in the Riemannian case. Hence the problem of this paper is much more difficult than the same problem in the Riemannian case.

We use data from OpenStreetMap s(O SM) to identify pos-sible routes and locations of turns and we find the rott tre that best fits the given speed data. OSM data is in the form of nodes that are associated with different roads so a path will be a sequence of nodes. Each node has a physical location, given by a latitude and longitude, allowing us to determine distances between segments of road and the turning angle of a path of nodes.
While it is certainly less restrictive to assume infinite precision for the average values of the coefficients rather than the coefficients themselves, it is still unclear whether this assumption on the average values could be satisfied. (The in-principle un satisfiability of this, on the other hand, wold imply that we can never, as a matter of fundamentals, get rid of systematic, as opp used to statistical, errors.) Note also that in order to apply the central limit theorem we need to have a fi-nite variance for the al-gorithm outputs. But, as the outputs (x i,yi) for randomly distributed input s(ui,vi) may not be bounded from above, it is yet to be shown that the former could have a finite variance even if the latter does.

In this paper, we focused on approaches for cleaning inconsistent web data. We showed that the current state of the art approach em, which learn and use conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) to rectify data, do not work well with web data as they demand clean master data for training. We proposed a fully probabilistic framework for cleaning data that involved lc:~rn-igt5eth the generative and error (corruption) models of the data and using them to clean the data. For generative models, we learn Bayes networks from the data. For error models, we consider a maximum entropy l1r;tmc(>rle for combing multiple error processes. The generative and error models are learned directly from the noisy data. Preliminary experimental results on web data showed that our probabilistic approach is able. to reduce errors in the data long af-ter CFD-based methods fail to be effective.

Let P be a simple polygon in the plane, that is, a closed region bounded by a piece-wise lin-ear, simple cycle. A triangulation To fP is a geometric (straight-line) maximal outer planar graph whose outer face is the complement of P and whose vertex set consists of the vertices of P. The edge sofT that are not on the outer face are called diagonals. Let d be a diagonal whose removal creates a \ convex quadrilateral f. Replacing d with the other diagonal off yields another triangulation of P. This operation is called a flip. The flip graph of Pis the abstract graph whose vertices are the triangulations ofP and in which two triangulations are ad-jacent if and only if they differ by a single flip. We study the flip distance, i.e., the minimum number of flips required to transform a given source triangulation into,, target triangulation.

Application to physical problems involving material points
Soon after General Relativity (GR) was first introduced, several attempts to form alternative theories of gravity where made. Some of the most interesting were those based on an effort to build a more general theory by dropping one or more of the several assumptions of GR, like the fact that the only degrees of freedom of the gravitational field are those of the metric, or the simplicity choice that the gravitational Lagrangian should be a linear function of the scalar curvature.
This study was made with two complementary approaches: CMD fitting and full spectrum fitting. The first method uses CMDs usually ob-tained with HST / ACla r=>Ss while the last uses long slit spectra that can be acquired on a ground based telescope. The two methods are consistent and it is notable that the full spectrum fitting can give finer constrains on the metallicity. In full spectrum fitting, the metallic-ity is directly constrained by the metal absorption lines from the stars, while CMDs rely on broadband s colours and on stellar evolution models. It is the first time that a detailed spectroscopic determination of the SFH was successfully applied to low surface brightness galaxy (with lowS / N data).

Our second argument in favor of our program has two parts: first we show that a necessary requirement for self-consistency of the renormalization program is that all of the internal prp a gators have to be of the same form. Second we show that in the process of connecting the internal and external pl:op a gators through the internal points immediately adjacent to the external ones, the requirement of consistency mandates that all of the propagators have to be of the same form. Since the external propagators by definition have to be consistent with the non-perturbative conditions on the system, t \ conclude that all of the propagators and the resulting counter-terms have to be i ppaf such form.
In summary, the contributions of this paper are three-fold.

Further development of descriptions of geometric shape and topological structure, as well as algorithms for their computation will provide a solid foundation for studying many important biological problems. The other important tasks are then to show how these descriptors ma\y be effectively used to deepen our biological insights and to develop accurate predictive models of biological phenomena. For example, in computing protein-protein interfaces, a challenging task is to discriminate surfaces that are involved in protein binding from other non-binding surface regions, and i) - understand in what fashion this de-pends on the properties of the binding partner protein.

Next, we consider accretion disk effects in more realistic waveform models. EM RIG Ws are highly relativistic, with velocities close to the speed of light and sometimes skimming the SMB H horizon. As such, Newtonian waveform estimates for GW data analysis are inaccurate. Here we investigate the relativistic correction to the EMR I dynamics using the extended one body framework, and make simple estimates on the imprint of accretion disk effects on the GW waveform. This analysis, however, continues to neglect relativistic corrections to accretion disk effects.

We als address the validity of using an effective theory. We find that for light DM masses (below a few hundred GeV), the iti bo?v n derived us-ing an effective tile or y may be accurate to about 10%.If the mediator is heavy, but below a couple TeV, the limit derived from effective theory is inr41o ~. conservative, and the true limit is stronger. But, if the mediator is too light to decay to dark matter pairs the true limit is far weaker than the one derived from effective theory. In addition, we find that the effective theory breaks dowuatDMmasnscs that are heavy enough such that the DM production is kinematically suppressed by PDFs, and we must take into account the UV physics in these cases.

These examples also show that outliers, in the functional sense, are not simply the re-sult of mis recorded data or extreme noise. They correspond to individuals that, for some reason, do not follow the pattern of the majority of the data, and often deserve to be studied more carefully rather than simply discarded. However, these atypical curves must be down weighted at the estimation step, or they may lead to er forteo u,s conclusions for the rest of the population.
Finally, for faint objects (SNRaround1per spectral channel), elec-tromagnetic interferences in the VLTI interferometric laboratory with the detector electronics prevents currently to get unbiased measurements.

One of the lessons of l?tltrznerio_a \ mechanics is that in an extensive system of variables, with short range interactions, at generic choices of parameters the? correlations decay exponent A al-ly. The correlation length is typically not much greater than the range of the interaction, and it is only in the vicinity of critical points that correlations exhibit structures of much greater scales. For a field theory based on local interactions, the interac-tion range vanishes on the scale of the continuum limit. Hence, in a constructive approximation, for which convergence is accomplished through ultraviolet cutoffs, the underlying system of the local variables needs to be very near a crit-ical point. Some familiarity with critical phenomena is, therefore, essential for the understanding of a continuum field theory.

To recapitulate, we studied anal tial iv and numerically the dynamics of the apparent reflection point at the over dense plasma surface. We have shown that the velocity of this point is a smooth function of time. However, the corresponding γ-factor has quasi-singularities or spikes when the surface velocity approaches the speed of light. These ultra-relativistic spikes are responsible for the high harl no nIc generation in the fo,r In of anat to second pulse train. We show that the atto second pulse emission can be efficiently controlled by managing the laser polarization. This is done by adding a low intensity control pulse with perpendicular polarization and frequency slightly different from that of the driving pulse. This relativistic plasma control allows to gate a single at to second pulse or a prescribed group in fatto second pulses.
Missed detection and false alarms are traded off by an arbitrary choice of threshold, as in any detection algorithm.

The PDPs achieved by different A RQs are shown in Fig.1.Ingeneral,ahig.ce,,EH rate is needed in order to meet a higher throughput requirement. Also, with a larger K,i.e., the maximum number of transmission attempts, the system has the po-tential to achieve a smaller PDP, but the throughput requirement become more difficult to satisfy. Besides, when the throughput constraint is met,AR Q without feedback and ARQ with adaptive feedback achieve the same performance under the optimal policies. This is because each packet uses all the trans missio a attempts to avoid packet drop, and t\]ld proposed ARQ protocol reduces to the ARQ without feedback. From this set of results, we can draw new design insights for communication sys-tems with EH receivers:

It is also worth to mention that in a forthcoming pa-per we will explore the dependence of the statistics of voids with σ8 and Γ,using the void statistics found in the 2dFGRS(Patirietal.,inprep.). All this makes the statistics of under dense regions a very promising tool to constrain cosmology not just with the current surveys but also to next generation high redshift surveys.

We have investigated the brach is to chr one problem for entangled states. This answers the question that we have raised in the beginning, namely, given an arbitrary product state and general non-local Hamiltonian, what is the minimum time for creating a desired entangled state? We have shown that the minimum time depends inversely on the speed of the evolution of the quantum system This is independent of the particular entanglement measure and holds even for multiparticle entangled systems. We have shown th c~t ('. or two qubits the pres-ence of initial entanglement does help in minimising the waiting time. In particular, we find that if wc are given an option of starting from a product state and an entangled state, and wants to reach the maximally entangled state, then it is better to start from some already initial entangled state. Because, in the later case the time required is less. We have shown that the time average of entan-glement rate depends on the Schmidt rank and on the fluctuation in the non-local Hamiltonian. We have also shown that in a bi local rotating frame the entangling capabil-ity is also directly related to the speed of the evolution of the ez J tangled staes. This shows that the entangling capability of a non-local Hamiltonian is actually a geometric quantity. Furthermore, we have proved a composition law for the minimum time when) \] th fe system evolves under composite Hamiltonians. We hup i that these findings will be of interest in understanding the entanglement rate and entangling capabilities of non-local Hamiltonians and in real experimental situations. In future, it will be interesting to see if all these findings ~ lsolfoldforqudits and multiparticle systems.

Our work is an addi-tion to the very limited literature on both pricing with negative network externalities and iterative pricing. The model captures many interesting settings in real-world marketing, and is usually much more challenging than the positive externality counterpart. The hardness result identifies complexity status of a fundamental pricing problem. The algorithms achieve satisfactory performances in general and several important special settings. An interesting direction for future research is to narrow the lower and up-per bounds on the approximability of the iterative pricing problem with negative externality. Obtaining more accurate estimations for the optimal pricing is a key to reduce the approximation ratios.

More specifically, we have restricted our analysis to a particular class of coupled DE scenarios characterized by a steep growth in time of the interaction strength, parametrized as a positive power of the cosmic scale factor. Such models have been shown to be in ful. agreement with present constraints on the background evolution of the Universe, as they do not feature the typical early DEscaling of other coupled DE scenarios like e.g. models with a constant or a more slowly evolving coupling function. The background evolution of the models investigated in this work is in fact practically indistinguishable from the standard ΛCDM cosmology. Furthermore, the impact of these alternative cosmologies on the statistical properties of large scale structures is confined at very low redshifts, which makes it problematic to test the models via e.g. weak lensing measurements.
We could have extended this symmetry breaking pattern to the case where we have tu su on sets of vector representations, φa 1andφa2.Theuuse,'tynclall?t\sp in connection can depend on the length of each Lorentz vector and the angle between the m,|φa1|,|φa2|,and|φa1φa2 |. The solutions for the minimum must be obtained from the conditions imposed on these three quantities. We can choose φa1C,A), with only the last component non-zero and φa2 with the last two components non-zero in order to satisfy these conditions. The Lorentz SO(3,1) symmetry is then broken down to O(2)(orU(1))symmetry44.

Let us describe the scheme mathematically and follow up with a simple example. ~ lOne symmetry lines and planes in the Brillouin zone, there exist symmetry operations for each k that form a group. For each such group the irreducible representations Γp can be found, and can be used to block-diagonalize the secular equation,
The plot of power against Type I error rate is sometimes known as tth c Receiver Operating Characteristic, or ROC, the name arising from its origin in radar. It is used a good deal in medicine (e.g.Zweig&Campbell1993).A useful quantity could be the integral under the ROC curve, known as the AUC (Area Under the Curve). In our application, it is not difficult to show that the AUC is the probability that the evidence ratio, as-suming H1, exceeds the evidence ratio, assuming H0. This condenses the ROC into a single number, which for our examples is quite close to unity. This may be a useful compression in some cases, but it does lose the possibility Of ascribing weight to the de-gree by which the evidence ratios exceed each other.

Since the heart of this pathing problem is the lack of turn information one approach is to treat this as a classification problem. Here, we examine the speed traces to extract features: stop, right turn, left turn, or straight road. If classification would w org, well, we can assign probabilities to different choices at each inter-section and eventually find the highest probability path. However, road conditions and driving habits are very diverse. With our data set we were unable to classify turn features with high enough accuracy to build correct paths. The sheer volume of paths to explore meant that unless the correct path was extremely different from all of the incorrect paths, the algorithm would find some incorrect paths that looked just as good, or better, than the correct path.

A DAG model encodes conditional indepen-dence relationships via the notion of d-separation.S evs ral DAGs could encode the same set of conditional independence relationships. These DAGs form an equivalence class, consisting of DAGs with the same skele-ton and v-structures. A complete partially directed acyclic graph (CPD AG) uniquely describes such an equivalence class. In fact, di-rected edges in l he CPD i),l are common to all DAGs in the equivalence class. Undirected edges in the CPD AG correspond to edges that are directed one way in some DAGs and another way in other DAGs of the equivalence class. The absence of edges in the CPD AG means that all DAG members in the equivalence class have no corresponding edge. If all the conditional independence relationships of a distribution P and no additional conditional independence relations, can be inferred from the graph, we say that the distribution P is faithful to the DAGG. More precisely, ifP is faithful to the DAGG: for any triple of disjoint sets A, BandS in V,

Introduction and main result
In the literature there have been some attempts to use i fruit enb n-~L be ea in groups te describe the family repetition structure. Usually, representations are considered to model the generations, and a complicated Higgs sector is constructed to ac-count for the observed mass differences between the fermions. In my opinion, this does not really solve the mass problem but just s-hifts it to another level. It would be much more desirable to understand the fermion masses dynamically, in the model at hand, for example, by understanding the differences between the binding sofpreons1,2,3and4.

It is instructive to look at the way an eigenfunction at a given parameter value (α,β)is turned into the second-next higher state after the rotation around the singularity. In Fig. IV,an example of such wave-function morphology is displayed. One essential feature is the node change which oc-curs at the crossing of β=0line.Ont~.~lline, the system is separated into the non-communicating two subsystems atx=0 because of the infinite value of δ.The reason of no al chn nge is that the approach to β=0linefromtheβ>0sideandβ<0 side are physically distinct because they each cor-respond to δ=±∞and δ=∓∞respectively. (The composite signs are for the case of αγ0>1andαγ0<1 respectively, in turn.) Yet,atβ=0 line, two cases get connected smoothly.

In this letter we have examined the consequences of feedback from an early episode of SN explosions in proto-galaxies. An extension of the mechanism proposed by Dekel&Silk(1986), to higher velocity dispersion halos yields a modulation of the baryon fraction available for disk formation that depends on the depth of the potential well. This feedback applied to simple prescriptions for disk formation implies that the either the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher or the mass-to-light ratio is weakly dependent on the velocity dispersion of the halo. The implications of this scenario for the MilkyWay disk are that approximately 10 % of the original gas that fell in was expelled prior to disk a) (embl y,a high-redshift of formation ilicbisingoodflr.eemntith \ [, he ages of the oldest thick disk stars is inferred for average to high values of the spin parameter of the MilkyWay halo with a local baryon fraction that ranges from the universal value of 5%toavalueof20 % W?hich is what is inferred from X-ray stud-ies of the Intra-cluster medium in clusters of galaxies.
The first solution procedure is a sequential one, where one first computes grid values of the cost function and then carry out the optimization procedure by employing the approximate values interpolated from the grid. It is important to note that all the grid values provide the design or?ah?tl:xxro1? variables along with the corresponding mechanical state variables of displacements and rotations which must satisfy the weak form of equilibrium equation. In other to ensure this requirement, for any grid value of design or control variables one also has to solve associated nonlinear problem in structural mechanics.

It is thus just as well that the only candidates we can see for quantities that might be calculable with arbitrary precision are the meta-observables, which extend beyond anyone horizon. Since the horizon vol-ume (after a limited number of inflationary e-foldings) does not contain a living observer anyway  any precisely calculable quantities associated with the interior of a horizon would be wasted.

Appendix
In the quiet-Sun magnetic networks, cavities are important locations where the magnetic fields are sufficiently inclined due to their w cll evolved horizontal components. They are formed over the granular cells in form of the field-free regions due to the transport of plasma at their boundaries and overlaid by bipolar magnetic canopies. The ver\tical magnetic fields, however, reside mostly in the core of such magnetic networks (Schrijver & Title, 2003;Centenoetal.,2007). Such mag-netic cavity-canopy systems are thought to be ideal resonators of the various MHD waves that can be trapped in the cavity, as well can also leak in form of the magneto acoustic-gravity waves upward through the core of such magnetic networks. It is thought that the field-free cavity regions underlying (; h (> bipolar canopy can trap the high-frequency acoustic oscillations, and the low-frequency components may leak into the higher atmosphere in form of magneto acoustic-gravity waves (Kuridzeetal.,2008; Srivastava etal.,2008; Srivas-tava, ZO10).unThet,ef0.rc, such magnetic structures in the lower solar atmosphere are the regions that may play an important role in the wave filtering (e.g. McIntosh & Judge, 2001;Krijgeretal.,2001; McAteer et al., 2002;Vecchioetal.,2007,2009; Srivastava, 2010, and references there-in).

We first return to a point briefly mentioned earlier in the paper about a difference in the UPB construction which appears when orthogonal UP Bs are replaced by generalized UP Bs. In the former case the PPT property follows directly from the projection form of ρ,since this implies alsoρP to be proportional to a projection, and therefore to be positive. With the use of a generalized UP B, we have no proof for this to be the case. Clearly the UPB construction will be simpler if we only have to take into account conditions that apply to ρand not to both ρandρP, and for that reason we shall examine this point a bit further.
To reason about convergence of probabilistic processes, we will use the total variation distance on distributions (also known as statis-tical distance).

These calculations demonstrate that luminosity and temperature of protostars not only depend on mass and age, but also on the accretion rate in the main accretion phase. There-fore, the posi-tion of a protostar on the HR diagram is sensitive to the cluster environment, because stochastic core interaction and competition strongly influence them a~s accretion rate: PMS tracks are not unique, and mass (or similarly age) of individual protostars from using the HR diagram can only be determined in a statistical sense.
Non minimal torsion-matter coupling extension of f(T) gravity
When fitting a simple modified black-body model to the data, we must keep in mind that there is a partial degeneracy between βand Td and, more importantly, a per-fect degeneracy between Td and z. The peak of the SED is determined by the ν/Td term in the exponential, so that a measurement of the colours alone constrains only the ratio (1+z)/Td. However, assuming reasonable priors on the free parameters of the? ED model (in our case, βand Td) it is still possible to estimate a qualitative redshift distribution for our sample of sources. Alter-natively, if secure redshifts are known from optical cross-identifications, we can determine the dust temperatures.

The paper is organized as follows. There E on d chap-ter introduces the variational formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation from which the drift can be derived by minimization of a functional. The third chapter shows how a regularized empirical approximation of the functional leads to a nonparametric estimate. The fourth chapter presents examples of this estimator for the class of Langevin equations for which the extra conditions lead l,o only mild restrictions. The fifth chapter explains how the method can be extended to other types of noise, such as jump processes. We conclude with a discussion and possible extensions of the method in chapter six.

The extrac-tion of the above mentioned information from the experimental data suf-fers from several difficulties which arise due to the complexity of the reaction mechanism. The ideal situation occurs when the reaction mechanism can be explained with very simple models. In this article we use a simple and tractable model for the reaction mechanisms and apply it to the study of the scattering of unstable beams. Under some circumstances it is shown that our model can be very useful to extract the ground state properties of exotic nuclei. A study of this feature is presented in sections 3and4. A brief explanation of the calculation ground state densities for exotic nuclei is done in section 3. These densities are used as inputs in the calculation of the elas-tic cross sections, which are compared to some available experimental data in section 4. To show the feasibility of the models used, we also compare the theoretical predictions with some experimental data for reactions with stable nuclei.

To shed light on this dependence, we present in this section a second set of simulations which are identical to the previous set presented before but for the radii of the two clusters, which we fixto3pc in the two clusters. We follow the structure of the first set of simulations and use different W0 parameters (W01andW02):3,6,9and12 for the two clusters. This gives 16 possible combinations and this time we perform two realisations per combination, which makes in total 32 simulations.

The tight empirical relationship between radio and far-IR luminosities for star-forming galaxies allows us to take advantage of the wealth of data at far-IR / sub-mm wavelengths to derive the radio evolution properties. We expect a different eyo? luu on for starburst and normal late-type galaxies as the starburst activity is likely triggered by interactions and mergers that were more frequent in the past, while in normal galaxies the star-formation rate has probably not changed much over their lifetimes. The bulk of the sub-mm counts measured by SCUBA surveys (Scott etal.2006;Coppinetal.2006) is due to yet another population, the sub-mm galaxies (SMGs), interpreted as proto-spheroidal galaxies in the process of form-ing most of their stars (Granatoetal.2004).

What are the alternatives to the singular description of the translational motion of the D0-brane by means of open strings? In analogy to the techniques used for field theory solitons, one can introduce the translational degree of freedom for the D0-brane explicitly (as a dynamical trajectory).

This is the world line formalism that will be our primary subject in the next section. As we shall see then, the amplitudes constructed within this framework are free of in-frared pathologies.

We have presented optimized strategies to improve the efficiency of blind searches for isolated gamma-ray pulsars, whose search sensitivity is computationally limited. Under these conditions, our results confirm that ull y coherent searches are generally less efficient than semi coherent searches, as well as that harmonic summing is typ-ically less efficient than searching only for the strongest individual harmonic. We also derived the parameters for most efficient search grids. As motivated by these results, we presented and studied the implementation of a multistage search strategy. We have also presented efficient computation and interpolation techniques for the semi coherent test statistic, offering further important sensitivity gains. Finally, we have conducted realistic simulations which demonstrate the improved performance from our combined advances, pro-viding Id a substantial increase in sensitivity (i.e. lowering the minimum de-tectable pulsed fraction by almost 50 %) over previous methods at the same computational cost.

For A commutative this is the same as ρ(a x)=|a|ρ(x), which is the usual form this sort of axiom takes in the commutative case. But this last version is not appropriate in the noncommutative case because ρ(ax)is positive, while | a | ρ(x), though a product of two positive elements, in general can not 99 be expected to be self-adjoint, let alone positive.

A well known result of metric theories of gravity is the uniqueness of cosmological distances (Etherington 1933).Thus measurements of the luminosity distance dL(z) and angular diameter distance dA(z) at redshift z are linked through the duality relation (Linder 1988;Schn?eideretal.1992)
This is the anomaly equation in euclidean space and it con-tains θas expected in the mass term. This confirms that the zeta function approach is not blind to θeven though the determinant is.

Thermodynamic and chemical effects of strange let mass
Whether the dissipation of vortex energy contributes significantly to cluster heating will, of course, ultimately depend on the energy released by the AGN. Even if the dissipation time is short compared to the travel time and the cooling time, a sufficient amount of energy has to be in-jected into waves and then extracted into the vortex field, which depends on the filling factor of cavities in clusters and the on AGN energy output relative to the cooling rate.

It seems to us that before resorting to introducing more objects to describe the same basic physics (diffraction), one should fully examine all other alternatives.
A guiding principle underlying any effective theory aiming to describe the low-energy limit of a deeper, more fundamental theory can be formulated in the following way: The low-energy (infrared) phenomena are not sensitive enough to resolve high-energy (ultraviolet) dynamics. It means that short-range (high-momentum) dynamics can be removed from the theory and replaced (renormalized) by a few local corrections. In momentum space one can therefore expand a short-range (SR) interaction as:
Finally, since θy≥0f orally, we have

TheY akin du models may in-clude state and transition actions. Since UPPAAL only supports transition actions, we also translated any necessary state action to a transition action. In Yakin du, the state ac-tions include entry, exit and timer based actions. The entry action should be performed once when entering the state. We translated this to an action assigned to all the incoming transitions to the cr respond iag state. The exit action, which must be ex-ecuted when existing the state, was translated to actions on all the outgoing transitions. For the timer-based state actions, we created a self-transition and used the timer as transition guard.

Here, we present the first design and implementation of a microfabricated trap to perform individual addressing for optical transitions using a magnetic field gradient. Addressability is demonstrated by observing distinct peaks in the frequency spectrum, and by performing Rabi oscillations on one of two trapped ions with a low probability of unwanted excitation on the ncintifyghl)~ringi on. Inte-grating the gradient-generating wires with microfabricated traps assures position stability. We evaluate this individual addressing scheme to show that we can achieve reasonable gate speeds, and minimal crosstalk between neighbouring ions, with no decrease in coherence time measured with spin-echo. Finally we consider its p~o spects for scaling to many ions.

From these observations, we find that htl f?ex le is a real sense in which the topological winding of the ground state is still encoded in the disordered system. Even though the disorder induces scattering and tends to randomize the internal configuration of the single-particle states, the correlation between momentum and internal degree of freedom persists throughout the topological state. This manifests itself consistently as a spectral flow of orbital entanglement modes as a function of the momentum entanglement cut. The topological phase transition toward the trivial state eventually occurs when the scattering is strong enough that entanglement modes saturate 1l2, which we have identified throughout this work as leading to the trivial Anderson insulator. It would be interest-ing to see how these results can be applied to higher-dimensional topological systems. In higher dimensions the scattering kinematics are much less constrained and it is not clear how well the topological information would be encoded in the momentum entanglement. However, here we see that we can capture the correlations between the momentum and the internal degrees of freedom which is a fundamental feature of free-fermion topological phases, so perhaps this tool wil \] still ha useful. It may also be useful to consider this type of hybrid cut for numerically identifying 1D interacting topological phases of fermions or even in spin-systems.

The requirement of having a finite automorphism group means that any component whose normalization is rational must contain at least 3 singular points.

For an interpretation of these results it is important to distinguish be-tween the spectroscopic and intrinsic quadrupole moment of a particle. It is known that a van-ishing spectroscopic quadrupole moment does not nec-essarily imply a spherically sym t net ric charge distribution. For deformed spin0andspin1/2 nuclei this has l'd to the general cone pt of an in-trinsic quadrupole moment, which can be c let f line. for different nuclear models. The notion of an intrinsic quadrupole moment allows to interpret mea-surable quantities such as transition quadrupole moments in terms of the geometric shape of the ground state.

One way is like the following: To apply the Seiberg-Witten map associated with the non commutativity in the rectangular coordinates we first transform the commutative solution obtained in the polar coordinates into the one in the rectangular coordinates. Then after getting noncommutative so-lutions by applying the Seiberg-Witten map with the canonical commutation r e|at;on of the rectangu-lar coordinates, were-write them back into the polar coordinates. The other way is to use the Seiberg-Witten map directly in the polar coordinates without rewriting the solution back and forth between the po-lar and the rectangular coordinate sy~tems.

In this section we review the S-matrices for scattering among the kinks and elementary (Majorana) fermions. From these we deriveS-matrices for scattering between Dirac fermions, kinks and Dirac fermions, and rank2 bound states and Dirac fermions. Knowledge of these S-matrices will allow us to compute the various form factors needed to ohta in tim results in the previous section. Before beginning it is necessary to layout the group theory of SO(8). In particular it is necessary to describe the spin or representations (i.e.thekinks)ofSO(8).

The paper is organized as follows. The QCD sum rules of three-point correlators are considered in Section 2, where the spectral densities are calculated in the bare quark-loop approximation and with account of the Coulomb corrections, and the gluon condensate term in the Borel transform scheme is presented. Nul'~tergumericnl estimates of semi\leptoniC decay modes are also given here. Section 3 is devoted to the NRQCD sum rules for re-coil close to zero. The spin symmetry re-lations are derived and the gluon condensate is taken into account in the scheme of moments. The results are summa-rized in Section 4.AppendicesAandB contain technical details in evaluation of decay width sfo the massive leptons and gluon condensate in full QCD, respectively.

The parameter α,which is proportional to the volume density of infalling material, becomes the key parameter to be constrained hythe data. Its spatial variation α(R,z) is not known. However, experimenting with different patterns we found that the results are not qualitatively very different as long as its value does not vary too steeply in the inner halo. We therefore take αto be constant, which implies that in a given interval δt a cloud captures the same amount of infalling gas regardless of its location.

In this letter, we derive the coverage probability and the spectral ef-ficiency of the worst-case MU in the don wn link cellular network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to analytically derive the p;erformance of the worst-case MU, using the stochastic geometry. Even if simplifying assumptions are made, we believe our analysis plays vital roles in analyzing randomly deployed BSs and serv-ing as a reference for future research on the performance of the worst-case MU.

In this paper we have presented a detai pred Bayesian error analysis based on binary-hypothesis testing (BHT) to de-rive expressions for the minimum combined source strength needed to super resolve a pair of closely spaced point sources located in the plane of best focus from their image formed under a Gaussian PSF approximation.

The paper is organized as follows. In§2, we describe the basics of binary source and blending effects on the light and astrometric curves of lensing events. In § 3,we the present astrometric curves and the corresponding lightcurves of example binary-source events to illustrate the relative difficulty in describing the astrometric lensing behaviors by the blending approximation alone. In § 4,we statistically estimate the range of the binary source separation and the companion light fraction where the blend-ing approximation breaks down for the description of the photometric and astrometric lensing behaviors. We conclude with § 5.

The result of the above-mentioned changes in the code is that substantially larger fraction of binaries than com-puted before passes trough the stage of stationary mass exchange instead of forming common envelopes and the number of systems with sub giant donors increases by about an order of magnitude compared to the number obtained in Yungelsonanetal.,(1996).In symbiotic binaries, the number of WD with stationary burning increases by a factor ≃ 2.5.

It is also noteworthy that Bogdan etal.(2003),Fedunetal.(2009) and Fedunetal.(2011a) discussed in detail the excitation, propagation and conversion of magneto acoustic waves in a realistic 3DMHD simulation. However, in these references, the waves driven by a periodic driver were discussed, whereas we numerically simulate the excitation of magneto acoustic-gravity waves gen-erated by pulses in the gas pressure and vertical component of velocity, mimicking an isolated solar granule. We aim to investigate and understand this simpler (albeit complex enough) system before tackling the more realistic, multiple granule system. Our philosophy is to build up our models incrementally, with a clear focus on the underlying physical processes at each step.

Since the CLASh as very good; ~ (: pr rope I) riu co for charged particles, and a very limited one for neutrals, the analysis of the γd→π0d reaction was based on detecting the final-state deuterons and selecting the good events by the missing-mass technique. Deuterons were identified from their time of flight and momentum, which allowed a mass reconstruction. Thus, the initial events election was done based on the reconstructed mass. Further selection of events was achieved by comparing the event ver-tex time with the photon vertex time as measured by the tagger. Low-momentum protons were discarded based on a cut on the particle momentum vs. energy loss in the TOF. In addition, fiducial cuts were applied to the re-maining data sample in order to remove edge areas of the detector where the acceptance was not well reproduced by a simulation.

A crucial note is due. The edge spin polarization in ballistic systems appears not as a result of electric field-driven acceleration of electrons and associated with it precession of spins. Indeed, electric fiel,: lna ballistic system is absent as the electric potential drop occurs over a contact region with the leads rather than over a bulk of a ballistic conductor. Nevertheless, spin precession does occur. It originates from accelerated electron motion in the boundary potential that provides lateral confinement. Bias applied to the contacts ensures that populations of left-and right-moving states are different and the net spin precession appears. Naturally, it is proportional to the applied bias V. The net spin accumulation near an edge of a2DEG is independent of the shape of the boundary potential,

To estimate the axion decay constant around the special points, it is required to derive an exact form of period vector and its monodromy transformation.

It thus allows us to study the axion decay constant around the special points of moduli space.

This method is based on a lifting technique which recasts nonlinear sys-tem identification as the identification of the linear Koopman operator in an infinite-dimensional lsl facc of observables. A key advantage of the method is that it relies only on linear techniques. Also, it is ro-bust to noise, well-suited to model low sampling rate data sets, and efficient to recover the vector field of different classes of sys-tems.

Different approaches to the fermion mass problem are reviewed. We illustrate these approaches by summarizing re-cent developments in models of quark and lepton mass matrices. Dynamical calcu-lations of the top quark mass are discussed, based on (a) infrared quasi-fixed points of the renormalisation group equations, and (b) the multiple point criticality principle in the pure Standard Model. We also consider Yukawa unification and mass matrix texture. Models with approximately conserved gauged chiral flavour charges beyond the Standard Mo~el are shown to naturally give a fermion mass hierarchy.
For the nematic phase the relation is found to be
Adding the four results does not yield the de-sired answer, since thc contribution of each of the two axes has been included twice, and that of the original together four times. This can be easily corrected by subtracting F2(λ2,λ3;S) which removes the extra contribution of the j1=0axis,andF2(λ1,λ3;S) which does the same thing with the j2=0 terms. This leaves us with the origin (j1=j2=0) which, at this point, is st/l H contributing double its value (two cunt rib g tions have been removed with the two axes); subtracting λS3fixes that as well.

Engineering strong p-wave interactions between fermions is one of the challenges in modern quantum physics. Such interactions are responsible for a plethora of fascinating quantum pheno moe\n auch as topological quantum liquids and exotic superconductors. In this letter we propose to combine recent developments of nano plasmon ics with the progr css in realizing laser-induced gauge fields. Nano plas-mon ics allows for strong confinement leading to a geometric resonance in the atom-atom scattering. In com-bination with the laser-coupling of the atomic states, this is shown to result in the desired interaction. We illustrate how this scheme can be used for the stabilization of strongly correlated fractional quantum Hall states in ultracold fermionic gases.

The main reason why the BRST invariance in the CGHS model is intact is that the Kato-Ogawaanomalyterm(34) (that corresponds to the central extension of the Virasoro algebra) is BRST trivial. That is, this term can be can-celed by adding to the action a local counter term of the form

Let us first consider a system with only two states, Aand B. Unless there is at least one transition (say, from A toB), the system is trivial and does not evolve at all. However, with only A→B the steady state of the system is ρ(A) = 0 and the gener-alized entropy φis not well defined. We therefore need consider eoy systems that include both transitions, A → Band B→A. Such systems, howev-er, have an equilibrium state that obeys detailed balance, and therefore the Crooks relation is satisfied for all (relevant) two-state systems.
6.At high energy densities a deviation of the Ur QMD equilibrium state from SM results is found. It is connected with a specific behaviour of string d~g re\]a:d esf freedom in the Ur QMD model. This energy density region lies close (or even above) to the expected phase transition bound-ary ol'. the quark-gluon plasma state. The study of this energy density region deserves further efforts.
InSect. VI we estimate persistent currents in the rings made of real band insulators (GaAs, Ge,In As) with a fully filled valence band and empty conduction band. The current at fullfilling decays with the ring length exponentially due to the exponential decay of the Wannier function tails. In spite of that, it can be of measurable size.
TWo effects should be considered here. First, if most PNs are formed from more massive than the Sun stars, which on average are more metal rich, then the percentage of progenitors interacting with planet increases. Second, asnotebySoker(2001b), most known Sun-like stars that have planets around them will not form PNs at all. Their plan-et(s) will deposit enough orbital angular momentum and energy to cause most, or even all, of the envelope of these stars to be lost already on the red giant branch. These stars will not evolve along the AGB, or evolved only along the early AGB. In any case, they will have too low mass envelope to form a detectable PN. This reduces Llmld_is_founracio_2_~(~),,,lafPN progenitors interacting with planets.

Being that the analyzed events are mainly peripheral with small contaminations from the mid-rapidity source and well detected from the point of view of the size of the QP and the linear momentum, the excitation energy has been calculated via calorimetry. Possible contributions of nonthermal origin to the excitation energy have hi~en evaluated by comparing the measured kinetic energies to thermal predictions. Indeed some pre-equilibrium light particles or fragments could have been included in the reconstructed Quasi-Projectile and contributed to its excitation energy.

One may perhaps object that the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy produced by the growth of a black hole is not actually produced (or at least not made accessible) until the black holes decay by way of Hawking radiation. The larger the mass of the black hole, the longer this takes, and certainly for the black holes at the centers of galaxies this time scale is considerably longer than the age of the universe. This claim would seem to fly in the face of the usual connection between black-hole area and entropy required by the second law of thermodynamics. Nonetheless, even that will not prevent black holes from being the primary source of entropy in the universe.
Homology and Cohomology
The analysis differs from previous point source searches most drastically in two points.
The central idea underpinning our dynamical approach is the following: Considering a diffusion process on a network, we ask ourselves what this simplest form of dynamics can reveal about the underlying community structure of the graph. This idea is readily illustrated by the example of a vessel filled with water in which one were to put a small droplet of ink and observe how it diffuses. If the container has no structure, the dye would dif-fuse isotropically. If the container is structured? e.g., compartmentalised or comprising a set of smaller vessels con-nected via some tubing), the dye would not spread isotropically but would rather get transiently trapped in certain regions for longer times until it eventually becomes evenly distributed throughout the whole vessel. Therefore by observing the time dynamics of this diffusion process we can gain valuable information about the structural otg a isation of the container.

Thus CG(H) must be a torsion group, in particular, CG (H)is elementary, else CG(H) would have to contain a non-abelian free subgroup.

In the present paper, matrix elements of a two-body interaction between states of jn configurations were considered. The two-body interaction is taken to be a perturbation and hence, only the sub-matrix of the Hamiltonian, defined by states of the jn configuration, is considered. The matrix elements are functions of two-body energies V(J)=<j2JM|V|j2JM > There are states whose expectation values (diagonal matrix elements) are linear combinations of the V(J) with positive rational coefficients. In this paper, it was shown that this is always the case for states which are the only ones with give nJ in the jn configuration considered. Such states are eigenstates of the sub-matrix considered.

We first deal with the problem of extract in bubs and functional modules. Most previous approaches have looked at the problem of detecting functional modules separately from that of hndoff,ubpFotelns.HoQevyr, hub proteins form the key constituents of most functional modules. In any functional module, the hub proteins not only hold the other proteins within that module together, but also determine the most dominant functions of that module. Also, protein networks are usually very sparse with several singleton (isolated) and loosely-connected proteins. Such proteins may be connected to one or more hub or non-hub proteins, but generally do not take part in any functional module. Taking such proteins into consideration induces false positives, thereby affecting the specificity of the results. As a result of these observations, we approach the whole problem in the following three steps:

Specifically, in § 2 we discuss the retrieval of the Spitzer data used in our study and their photometry. General description of the mid-infrared characteristics of the region is given in § 3,andin§4 the point sources detected with our photometry, and the selection of candidate Y SOsa represented. The recent release of high-resolution data on NGC602/N90 obtained with? th Advanced Camera for Surveys on Hubble Space Telescope allowed us a detailed photometric study of the stellar association and its surroundings down to the faint red pre-main ma sequel lebt als of the system (Schmalzletal.2007).In§4we also combine the results from both Hubble and Spitzer photo me tries to identify the optical counterparts of the candidate Y SOs found in the region. Based on our findings we discuss the current star forming process that probably took place in the re-gion of NGC602/N90 with emphasis to the clustered behavior of st(ar formation in § 5. Finally, general conclusions of this study are given in § 6.

Namely, the thermal masse Pm c.\[lr n.o*n' is positive as is the case in conventional theories. This is, in fact, crucial for restoration of symmetry at finite temperature.

We have computed the derivatives of the overlap Binder cumulant in the range from g=0.6tog=0.8 (the crossing point is close to the value 0.75). In this interval we have fitted the Binder cumulant curves (at fixed L) using fourth and fifth order polynomials (in order to control the systematic effects due to the fitting procedure). To cross check consistency we have also used a derivative both with respect to the. enit her ature and with respect to β:the two procedures are equivalent and they should produce the same result.

We find that our results are qualitatively in accordance with numerical simulations indicating that if vortices are forced to oscillate with amplitudes larger than the typical VL parameter, plastic motion introduces topolog-ical defects and reduces mobility. For smaller drives, vortices perform small excursions interacting repeatedly with neighbors and as the lattice becomes successively more ordered, its mobility increases.

The second run of the LHC is now ongoing and new data will soon allow us to shed more light on the physics living at the TeV scale.

To express the average properties of intensity and flow fields around por?es in more quantitative terms, we compute for each in-stance azimuthal averages of intensity, velocity, divergence, and radial component of velocity. Pores come in a variety of shapes so that computing meaningful azimuthal averages becomes a challenging task. In the following, we describe two different approaches to compute azimuth l averages based on s~g le and time-averaged G-b and images.
Thus, we have a very clear one to one map between giant graviton configurations and vacua of the auxiliary gauge theory on the D0branes. The map is naively three to one, but we have seen that the configuration with no polarization (dual to the KK graviton) is excluded, and the two configurations dual to the same gauge theory vacuum have non-overlapping ranges of validity.

2. Shower Finding: Taking candidate tracks as input, an EM shower finding algorithm is used to identify the muons with possible EM shower dE / dx information. Muons deposit energy as a minimum ionization particle (MIP) in the \ detecto cells. The additional EM shower hits can deposit much more energy in a small de-tector region and overlaps with muon energy. It is then possible to take the energy deposition of reconstructed cosmic tracks and look for the region where the energy is significantly greater than a MIP. More specifically, Ifweencind5 consecutive planes with energy greater than 2MIP,callit the shower start point; If we find 5 consecutive plane with energy in the range of 0.5MIPto1.5MIP,c~.lit the shower endpoint; If we find both the shower start and endpoint, then the shower is identified as Brem; If we find only the shower start point, and reach the end of track without an endpoint, the shower is identified as an electron from DiF. Showers with energy deposition passing the energy cut are saved as raw digit objects.

If one processes the rest of the simulation on the GPU as well, the picture gets somewhat better. Most of the other parts of the simulation are bandwidth bound, i.e. typical speed-ups are around 5.TakingChe same numbers as before yields an overall speed-up of 15.4and13.8, respectively. So if parts of the code that are less optimal for the GPU are also ported, not only will single node performance be better, but the code should also scale much better. While the above number sarky somewhat arbitrary, they illustrate the general trend.

We have also looked at whether the future measurements of lepton number violation and non-unitarity of neutrino flavor mixing at low energies are possible to shed light on the masses of heavy Majorana neutrinos.

Such an analysis can simply be extended to the more general cases of the type-I seesaw mechanism with three or more heavy Majorana neutrinos.

The presence of noise in the data considerably affects the status of the inverse Ising problem. - As we will see later, even well-conditioned problem(s in the limit of perfect sampling (B → ∞) be-come ill-conditioned as soon as sampling is imperfect (finite B). The same statement holds for the spa p \ sity-b~s'ed criterion mentioned above: when data are generated by a sparse interaction network, the solution to the inverse Ising model is not sparse as a consequence of im-perfect fm nf?p. le?.t Only the presence of an explicit and additional regularization forces the solu-tion to be sparse. In much the same way, the procedure we present hereafter builds a well-con { li timon ed inverse Ising problem, which prevents overfitting of the noise. This \ pto Cet dur @ is based on the ex-pansion of the entropy at fixed frequencies in clusters of spins, a notion closely related to the neighborhoods appearing in the localized responses.

One virtue of this observation is that it helps explain away the gap between the many hundreds or thousands of fields of a typical string compactification (especially, the one h with enough vacua to solve the c.c. problem) and the smaller unt ber in the Standard Model, as symmetry breaking will get rid of nonabelian gauge groups and generally lift fi-eld.

The e?xper?imentally most relevant lattice is the fcc. The application of this theory to a synthetic fcc opal structure shows that the diffusion coefficient is linear with the mean free path of the carriers. This result holds up to mean free paths of the order of 15 % the diameter of the spheres. The effect of the opal structure is to reduce the effective speed of the carriers. We calculate the dependence of this effective velocity with the size of the spheres.
In section Z we briefly describe how to detect voids. In section 3 we present the statistics of voids found in cosmological numerical simulations and compare the performance of our algorithms. In section 4 we present the voids that we have found ii?the2dFRGS together with their statistical properties.

In this article, we follow a different route based on an underlying theory and demonstrate that this sce-nario indeed has great potentiality in addressing the issue of acceleration of the universe in different era from a common platform. The reader may consider it as an altogether new paradigm rather than the continuation of an old idea. We derive the form of the cosmological term from this theory, which rules out any ad-hoc behavior. This eventually answers to the question of energy exchange too. The dramatic consequence of this idea is that it reflects all the characteristics of the expansion his-tory of the universe of all era by a single entity and demonstrates a transition from inflationary phase to late accelerating phase through radiation-dominated and matter-dominated era. We also show that ΛCDM falls as a subset of this framework, which leads to further observational consequences.

Our second result is the following theorem:
In summary, we have introduced and tested a novel algorithm to simulate the stochastic dynamics of discrete variable mod-els. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Monte Carlo method involving real physical time, with no heuristic phase-space assumptions. This opens up the study of, e.g.,slrou,~IyouL-of,equI1ibrIu ili sit-uations for which exact numerical calculations are currently not possible.
As an immediate consequence, we have the following.

Hence, for unit quantum efficiency a photodetector measures the photon number distribution of the state, whereas for non unit quantum efficiency the output distribution of counts is given by a Bernoulli convolution of the ideal distribution.

We would like to make a transformation of the coordinate system from the separate particle coordinates (x1,x2)to(X,x) and introduce the field operator Ψ̂M(X) to represent the field of a composite meson which has the internal relative motion between the quark and the antiquark described by an internal wave function ψM.
The contingency tables associated with the other models show that they are stat i.t icl i?y equivalent regarding their accuracy. However, when only the lower energy range (below 5-7MeV, depending on the atomic number) is considered, a statistically significant differ-ence at the 95 % confidence level (p-valueof0.034) is observed between the ECPS SR model and the ECPS S R-HS one; the latter is more accurate with respect to experimental data.

It may be that the most stable and accurate filter set for SNIa cosmology could be built from a combination of glass and interference filters or possibly hybrid glass / interference fil-ters wher?e Fe aM gl-a l'ss provides the lw wavelength cut-on and a small number of interference filter layers pro fides the cut-off. The novel idea of using high pass filters with tuned cut-on points and then subtracting them post-observation to create a narrower filter may also be worth considering. However, this procedure increases the measurement error. Unless glass filters are developed in the infra-red the NIR filters need to be interference filters.

We investigated the effect of or-der direction, order aggressiveness and investor type on the dynamics of order flows. In each case, we found an increase of order volume followed by a slow decrease, which forms a peak around the extreme events. The volume peak of buyer initiated execution orders was found to appear earlier and higher than seller initiated executed orders around positive events, while the volume peak of seller initiated execution orders was found to lead buyer initiated execution orders in the magnitude and time around negative events. When orders are divided into four groups according to their aggressiveness, the behaviors of partially filled market orders, filled market orders and canceled orders are qualitatively the same: The volume peak of buy(sell) orders of each type appears earlier and higher than sell (buy) orders around positive (negative) events. However, l; he volume peak of sell (buy) limit orders shows up eArlier and higher than buy (sell) orders around positive (negative) events. No qualitative dif-ference has been observed in the volume dynamics around extreme events between individuals and institutions.

We have attempted to mak?e thin? work as self contained as possible. In particular, we do not assume any results concerning free Lie algebra s, which allows the theory of free Lie algebra sand the partially-commutative free Lie algebra s studied here to be developed in parallel. This comes at the cost of assuming certain facts about the combinatorics of words in RAAG s. We feel that this is a reasonable trade-off.
The number of charges a particle causes during its lifetime (i.e. the ~ um?ber f times a particle arrives at a site until it leaves the system), is exactly equal to the number of moves it makes; while the initial deposition represents a charge, but not a move, the final move (off the system) does not cause a charge.

A very important uncertainty in the kind of analytic orbital integration schemes we employ in this study is the mass evolution of the LMC overtime. The arguments laid out in this section are for the required in fall mass of the LMC. The subsequent mass loss incurred by the LMC as it orbits about the MW will necessarily cause significant modifications in the orbits presented in the following section. A proper analysis accounting for this effect requires detailed N-body simulations that, in principle, are beyond the scope of the simple backward integration scheme presented here. Nonetheless, to validate our assumptions, we will compare the results from one of the MW + LMC mass combinations with those obtained with the corresponding fully self-consistent N-body model.

We also provide a simple model, based on a mapping between the DNAk not dynamics and a biased continuous time randomwalks, which faithfully reproduces our Brownian dynamics simulations starting from a minimal number of assumption. This approach can then be used to predict how the shape of the electrophoretic arc should depend on system parameters such as the average lattice spac-ing (pore size) of the gel and the contour length of DNA knots; as we shall see, the predicted trends are in agreement with existing lwp-dImen ti,,nal electrophoresis data. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first example of a quantitative prediction of two-dimensional electrophoretic diagrams, hence we sug-gest that the ap-proach we present could potentially lead to even more accurate and targeted experiments to separate topo isomers in DNA or other polymers.

We explored in this paper the phase diagram of a nontrivial system. The effective energy and momentum, as we has the number of dunes and the total volume of these dunes are not conserved at the scale of the whole system. The model has a peculiar phenomenology, inspired by the geophysical problem of bar chan fields. In partic-ular, dunes interact with each other through nontrivial collisions and remote volume exchange. Dunes are injected in the fi cld, while volume loss at each one of them ensures they have a finite lifetime. Two parameters, coin pAring for ting and dissipation for ξ,isolated and interacting behavior for η,define the phase diagram.

While there are several protocols that enable users to privately compute the summary of their values, in many cases, as in the case of KDK, there are several hidden im-plementation bottlenecks which can significantly delay the calculations of different stages of the protocol. In this work we indicate that for instance the multi-round KDK protocol, due its heavy reliance on pairings is not practical at present for large numbers of users n>100,whereasPCL is highly practical in these cases at the expense of reduced collusion tolerance. We showed that further customization of the privacy level facilitates further extensions to both protocols, and such extensions were shown to be secure. If applied, these extension can boost the efficiency of both these protocols, leading to faster applications with customizable levels of privacy.

Such voting scenarios can be found in various real-world applications, for example, parliament voting and board elections of universities.

For the (2,6) superlattice, the narrowing and lowering of the gap has caused the upper edge of the gap to come below theFT frequency, leaving theFT mode once again well within the bulk phonon continuum. The coupling to these bulk modes is strong enough to produce a broad F'I resonance peak, as in the case of the pure(8,0) substrate.

While the HST im-age shows the features on a finer scale, the bulk of the apparent structure in the most prominent absorbing regions is resolved by WIYN. Some of the features show more filamentary edges and overall structure in the HST image. There are a few instances of features that are washed out by the seeing at WIYN but are detected in the HST image. However, there are also low-contrast features at high z that are detected in the WIYN images but not the HST image. The HST image more clearly resolves into individual fe,atures some of the absorbing material that lies further along the line of sight into the galaxy. As discussed above, there still exists at angle of overlapping features that can be picked out, but not distinguished, in the HST image.

The comparison of theoretical dependencies mass-radius, mass-temperature, mass-luminosity and measurement data became technical possible when information about main parameters of close binary stars was obtained, because it keeps the set of data about masses, radii and temperatures of stars simultaneously.

Our goal here is to motivate the length scale based approach to effective field theories used in this paper. In this approach, a length parameter enters as a regularizing parameter in the heat-kernel method of regularization. Because this approach is less intuitive than an approach based on energy scales, we first explain the latter and then see how it adapts to a length scale formulation.

The main contribution of the paper thus lies in investigating how the forecasts of volatility vary with different realized measures and mainly testing the time-frequency realized measures in forecasting. We show that the most important information influencing the future volatility is car-ried by the high frequency part of the spec-tra representing very short investment horizons of 10 minutes. This decomposition gives us an interesting insight into the volatility process. Moreover, we utilize jumps estimated by the JWT SRV estimator to build a Realized Jump-GARCH model, which outperforms significantly other models based on different realized measures.
The annealed approximation, introduced by Derrida and Pom eau, has revealed to be a good tool for the computation of the closing probabilities and the approximate solution of the model.

Among the most interesting of the individual structures, particularly in the context of the disk-halo interface in galaxies, are features 10and11. These struc-tures lie in the NE portion of the diskofNGC891 and are almost certainly connec ed with the star-formation activity on this side of the galaxy. This region shows enhanced Hαe mission, as well as several structures whose shapes are reminiscent of super shells (Rand etal.1990;Pildisetal.1994a). Given the known presence of Hαe mission near these two features, though seemingly slightly offset, the quantities derived for these two structures should be considered more uncertain than those derived for the previously discussed features due to H αcontamination in the R-b and image.

In summary, we propose a finite difference discretization criterion for the numerical integration of the KP Z growth equation starting from the corresponding generalized discrete Langevin equation. We show that, for any discretization scheme, exists a steady state probability density function of the discrete interface heights compatible wit b the continuous ones, after coarse graining. Besides, we derived the KP Z coefficients of the BD model as an example of our generalized discretization. Finally, our results can be used as a new tool for the direct numerical integration of grow-ing continuous equation sith nonlinear terms due to lat-eral growth like the KP Zone.

Finally, in the past few years, the study of the 511keV emission from positron annihilation in the galaxy attracted particular attention from astronomers and particle physicists. It is the oldest (Johnstone tal.1972) and brightest γ-ray line detected from outside the solar system, but despite more than 30 years of study, the origin of the annihilating positrons remains unknown yet(Sec.4; see also the recent extensive review of Prant-zosetal.2010).

The entire evidence for atoms was indirect as they were not seen directly. They gave rise to first serious challenge to realism in classical physics. The great physical chemist William Ostwald, as well George Helm, regarded atoms to be just mathematical constructs. This is quite analogous to situation about quarks in mid twentieth century. Ernst Mach,in view of his positivistic philosophy, also doubted that atoms really exist.

In summary, our measurements appear to confirm that the magnetically dissipated energy is sufficient to explain thermal and nonthermal en-ergies in solar flares, which strongly supports the view that magnetic reconnection processes are the primary energy source of flares. The non thermal energy, which represents the primary energy source of the thick-target model, is sufficient to explain the full amount of thermal energies in 71 % of the flares, according to the novel warm-target model (Kontaretal.2011). However, the derived nonthermal energies exe highly dependent on the the assumed temper-ature in the warm-target plasma, for which a sound physical model should be developed (see for instance Appendix A andB), before it becomes a useful tool to estimate the low-energy cut off of non thermal energy spectra. Future studies of this global flare energetics project may also quantify additional forms of energies, such as the kinetic energy in CMEs, and radiated energies in soft X-rays, EUV, and white-light (bolometric luminosity).

We have succeeded in using lattice Monte-Carlo methods to extract non-perturbative physics from Born-In feld electrodynamics, quantized using the Euclidean-time functional integral approach. The on-axis (quantum) electrostatic fields of a point charge are measured as functions of the chage e introduced as a Wilson Line. The approach of Lüsc her and Weisz, which reduces these measurements from an exponential-to a polynomial-time problem, was essential for extracting these quantities.

Not shown is the difference in molecular abundances. Here there is a resolution dependence on the formation time scale for molecular coolants, as discussed in Paper I. However, the amount formed is always sufficient to cool the cloud enough to produce the same final outcome. The final abundances are nearly identical at each refinement level except at the lowest resolution, which is different only outside of the dense regions in the final ribbon. Aside from features that do not affect the final distribution of star-forming gas, our results ru independent of resolution from lmax=4tolmax=6.

Symmetry breaking and hyper charge embedding in the string model.
In the context of this feedback process, we can now examine what the observed parameters no\['t ile _disk of our Galaxy imply for its formation history. The age of the disk stars in the Milky tV ay can be used as a diagnostic to pin down the redshift of assembly. Also, constraints can be obtained on the fr le que cy of accretion events in our halo if the bulk of the stars in the MilkyWay disk assembled at z>1. The thick disk stars have a relaxed exponential profile and were hence prob-ably in place quite early on. Moreover, since the relaxation time-scale for stellar systems is long compared to their typical dynamical times, these stars most probably formed in situ. Chemical evolution models of our galaxy seem to indicate that a constant star-formation rate is not a bad description (Wyse&Gilmore(1995)), implying that half the stellar mass of our Ga la?y prb abLy assembled well before z=1.

Summarizing, the 4D description is the following: the matter on the brane describes a visible sector in which the global symmetry is broken; bulk physics describes a hidden sector formed by a hot CFT which interacts with the visible one only through gravity and higher dimension operators. Some charge is transferred from the visible to the dark sector and this charge acts as a source for the Goldstone boson, so that it be-comes time-dependent.

Two-dimensional models like quantum chromodynamics in two dimensions (QCD2), are convenient frameworks to discuss these kind of phenomena since they present the basic aspects of the fun-damental four dimensional theories (such as the existence of nontrivial topological sectors and chirality properties) and, further-more, analytical results can be generally obtained.
A simple 3 - parameter classification scheme was used to identify spectral features. The scheme allocates each galaxy spectrum a code number frora0to2 according to the strength of spectral feat nes in each of the following three categories: early-type absorption lines (molecular features such as H,K,C N,Mg), Balmer series absorption lines (Hγ,H δ,etc.), and nebula remission line s(O II, OIII, H βetc.). This is physically motivated by the typical features produced by stellar populations at progressive stages during and after star-formation. We have selected an un-biased subsample of 56 galaxies which were classified using this scheme, and then collected into six broad classes with physical motivation, as follows: Class A, strong absorption lines; Class B, weak absorption lines; Class C, weak features; Class D, strong balmer lines; ClassE,s trong emission lines; Class F, Strong Balmer and Emission lines. We note that th le,~;e classes are not directly related to any structural morphology.

In this let-ter, we study the exchange interaction between 5d5electronsinthet2g orbitals with large SO interaction on the basis of J-J coupling scheme as a typical model of 5d electron systems. It is shown that the FM Ising interaction (quantum compass model) occurs in the edge-shared bond due to a selection rule of hybridization between Γ7andΓ8 orbitals. Simultaneously, anisotropic AFM Heisenberg interaction appears from the hybridization between Γ7 orbitals. These two interactions can be clearly distinguished by the second-order perturbation processes. It is also found that the FM Is in gilt er?a ctu becomes very small in the large SO region, which is overlooked in ref.7. As a result, we find that the interaction between 5d5 electrons changes from the FM Is-ing to the AFM Heisenberg interaction as SO interaction increases.

One of the most important coolants for white dwarfs during their early phases is neutrino emission. The processes that produce neutrinos in white dwarfs differ from the neutrino pro-duction associated with nuclear fusion. In a dense plasma, neutrinos can play the role that photons play in more ordinary stellar material. When photons are produced in these interactions, they quickly thermal ize with the plasma because of electromagnetic scattering. But when neutrinos are produced, they are not ther-malized and leave the star,t a kinh lueS? their share of the int ~ m clio en energy away with them. Thus neutrino emission is an energy sink, rather than a source.

Additionally, we perform an analysis of the radial veloci-ties of 134 clusters with properties obtained in this paper and from the literature.

With a sample of this size we are able to look at trends in kinematics with age and Galac-tic location. We especially utilize the wide range in ages to learn more about the evolution of cluster rotation.

Basic properties
Taking into account all the available experimental constraints / results, esp0ciaH~the125GeVSM-like Higgs bo-son at the LHC and the muon anomalous magnetic moment, we have studied the EW SUSY in detail sin theN MSSM for three scenarios. Using χ2 statistic test, we obtained the most favorable regions in the whole parameter space. Moreover, we found that the LHC SUSY searches for neutralinos / chargino sands leptons have already put considerable constraints on the electroweak SUSY sector. And then the favored model parameter space and the resulting mass spectra are modified accordingly. After the systematic analyses, we are led to the following conclusions:
The radiation-reaction force controls the rate at which orbits inspiral. This force can be expressed in terms of i,i lo \ rate of change of orbital elements, such as binding energy, angular momentum and the Carter constant. Since we restrict attention to an equatorial, quasi-circular EMR I geometry, we need to consider only the energy flux.

We stress our focus on minimizing search-time of the query, and the data structure r?hatCnablcsit, rather than detection perfor-mance which is fixed by the choice of algorithm. Choosing sample images as queries ensures that the chosen algorithm will positively detect (at least) a loop closure when one is there. However, to avoid critical ities in the evaluation, we remove the query image from the dataset, but assume that there is a true match with neighboring images or keyframes. In some cases, the neighboring keyframes may be sufficiently different to fail the test, hence introducing spurious errors in the evaluation as these should be considered loop closures. This occurs, for instance, when the dataset is severely temporally down-sampled, as in the Oxford set. However, this handicap is shared by all meth-ods, thus making our evaluation of the relative improvement due to the adoption of our data structure, fair.

The time lags of the plume detachment and post-plume phases have been calculated as follows. We take the radially averaged temperature field atz≈5δT for each snapshots in the window. If this value exceeds the mean bulk temperature it is assigned with a detachment event otherwise it belongs to the post-plume phase. By applying this simple procedure, the time se-ries is digitalized. The resulting step function has shorter and longer time periods for both dynamical building blocks. The meantime of plume detachment and post-plume is about the same and gives about 0.45TfforRa=3×109 where we haD a sufficiently long time series.

Neither model/s based on the remaining statistics. The first and most obvious thing to note is that the link-based model does extremely poorly when it comes to matching clustering while the SU GM does much better, which is nat-ural given that the SU GM explicitly includes triangles. More interestingly, conditioning on the triangles in the SU GM is enough to deliver better matches on all of the other dimensions. For instance, the link-based model considerably underestimates the first eigenvalue (3.86ascomparedto5.54), whereas the SUGMperformsbetter(4.68).

The main point is to apply to equation (12) the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and to extract the contributions order by ordering.
Macroscopic systems pose an intriguing question on the level of irreversibility. Consider a many-particle system displaying an order-disorder phase transition whose microscopic dynamics does not obey detailed balance. Does the broken detailed balance result in time-reversal symmetry breaking at the macroscopic level? On the one hand, one may expect that entropy productions of each particle add up to a macroscopic amount irrespective of araa(:raspeoscoplc state. On the other hand, if the system is in a disordered phase so that all configurations are almost equally likely, then irreversibility may not show up on a macroscopic level producing only a sub extensive amount of entropy. Asvteminanordcrc:d state has a lower entropy than in a disordered state. Then, which phase produces more total en-tropy including the system entropy and the environmental entropy? These questions lead us to the study of the entropy production in a model system undergoing nonequilibrium phase transition.
Galaxies analyzed in this work are all bona-fide Virgo cluster members: given the 3-D structure of the cluster, distances have been assigned following the sub cluster membership criteria of Gavazzietal.(1999).

If one of the shocked winds is at least mildly relativistic, for it to be significantly deflected the exerted lateral pressure is to be a substantial fraction of the ram pressure of the flow. Since the plasma ~ lio wise gt out from the system is already trans-sonic, this lateral pressure will be (Γ2 ×) higher than the thermal pressure, and the flow deflection will produce shocks. These shocks, which are stronger for higher Γ,will trigger large CD perturbations, and can be a source of energy dissipation in the form of particle acceleration.

We have seen in the previ-ous sec-tions that a low-energy measurement is extremely difficult because of the small-ness of the QED effect and be-cause of the large background noise, that must be suppressed to a very high degree to carry out the actual measurement, as well as because of systematic effects that must all be kept in check. However the photon-photon cross section is a fast-growing function of the photon energy, and a higher-energy mea-surement would be an interesting alternative approach. In this section we briefly consider the basics of photon-photon scattering, and how it relates to the underlying QED structure, and put forward some suggestions for possible experiments at a dedicated photon-photon scattering facility.

As we mentioned in the Introduction, in a Lorentz invariant theory the string tension extracted from the space like Wil-son loop should be the same string tension that determines the strength of the linear potential between two static charges. Lorentz symmetry, however, is not maintained in a variational calculation. Moreover, the theory we are studying is defined with an explicit ultraviolet regulator that itself breaks Lorentz invariance. It is thus interesting to perform a separate calculation of the potential between external charges.

Although it is impossible to rewrite a crossed graph exactly as an iterate of the ladder ker-nel K(2), the leading contributions of these graphs ro the high-energy and one-body limits are iterative. This can be easily shown in the case of the fourth-order crossed-box graph. In both of the field theories defined in the Introduction, this graph corresponds to an expression:

Having identified these various scales, we note now that the thermodynamical functions at high temperature are dominated by hard degrees of freedom. The quasiparticle picture that we shall develop takes into account consistently the contributions of the hard degrees of freedom together with those of the long wavelength collective excitations. We shall comment later on the techniques based on di-mensional reduction which al-l osa treatment of the ultrasoft contributions.

If an initial field configuration has a finite helicity, it can not decay further than the lowest energy state with the same helicity (a-gain as long as reconnection may be ignored). In practice, reconnection can not be ignored since diffusion will be important on small length scales, and rapid reconnection can happen through regions with dynamically-generated small length scales. Nevertheless, it is found that in practice helic-ity conservation is often a good approximation on a large scale, even when reconnection takes place on smaller scales inside the configuration.
In this section, we will review the theories of L-functions and base change. Those already familiar with them may wish to skip to the proof in the next section.

The magnetisation loops measured for different directions of the applied field in the (100) plane, proved that the magnetic behaviour is not isotropic in the plane. We have chosen two symmetry directions in the (100) plane which present distinct magnetic behaviour. The first direction is along the projection in the (100) plane of the bisecting line of two Ni-C r-Ni molecular directions, showed to be an easy axis of magnetization. The second direction perpendicular to the first one, showed to be a hard axis of magnetization. The corresponding magnetization s versus applied field curves are presented in figure 2(a,b). In the first orientation (figure 2a), the magnetization is reversed from the negative saturation value to the positive sat-uration value in zero field. When increasing the temperature, the saturation magnetization? d\ee ~ - ~, qt: ~? but the zero field slope remains constant below 0.6K. This is confirmed by the magnetic susceptibility measured in this direction(s eecingI6~nrobe\3a).

We then use these results to identify mod-els with certain additional structures, in analogy to the bi-metric case. Focussing on the case N=2,we first demand scale invariance of the proportional background solutions. This requirement translates into conditions on the interaction parameters which, in contrast to bi metric theory, do not lead to a unique model but leave us with a subset of free parameters. Our procedure can also be applied to general N and we use it to explicitly derive (highly symmetric) examples of models with scale invariant backgrounds.

We conjectured that we, could be only one step behind M2Mconver-sion.AnM2M conversion system has two requirements. First, it must be capable of convert an arbitrary, even unseen, source to a given target. Second, it must be able to convert a source to a target that never appears in the training phase, but has limited resources during conversion. Conceptually, our framework has the ability to accommodate M2M tasks. This could be achieved by introducing a speaker recognition network (in the form of another encoder) to replace the given speaker representation (one-hot vector in our case). Or, the speaker representation could be in other forms. Once the specker representation of the unknown target speakers is obtained from the limited speech, it is likely that the decoder can blend speaker and ph n'"em tic rep-resentations to synthesize a speaker-dependent spectral frame, ~ h\[l achieving M2M conversion.

In this section we introduce synthetic data examples to better understand the properties of the proposed methodology. Our goal is to demonstrate that as long as information is available, sample size increases, the mixture selection strategy proposed commonly select true correct generating distribution when there is one in the mix-ture family. A second synthetic data set is generated from a residual mixture model and we show that the mixture selection selects the distribution that better approximates the true mixture distribution. Finally, a thrid synthetic data includes outliers to show that the presented methodology selects a model capable of offering ro-bust estimation to regression fixed effects.

In conventional mag-nets with a long-range order, the local fields are static int he ordered phase.

Such a thermal evolution is rather anomalous. Finally, we discuss two possible origins of the fluctu-ating fields observed below TN.

A protein is compos cd by a long chain of a few hundred amino-acids and its chemical composition is specified by the sequence of amino acids (primary structure). In physiological situations, normally a protein folds in an unique way (tertiary structure). During the fo id i\n ^, the protein goes to the configuration of minimal energy (more precisely, to the configuration of minimal free energy). However, there are many quhit?ed~fferentcnon figurations of the protein which have an energy near the minimal one. There are proteins, which are called allosteric, which have two configurations which practically the same energy). Sometimes, if we perturb the protein by "a small amount, e.g. changing the pH or changing only one amino acid in the chain, the folding changes dramatically. We can also select one of the two different configuration by the binding of a lig-and.

The procedure of always choosing the shower history with smallest transverse momentum is taken rather than a probabilistic choice so that unnatural clus-terings are not assigned, for example in a three jet event a gluon collinear to the quark line could be clustered to the anti-quark.
It is interesting to note that the values which we have use are on the boundary for the onset of chaos, as the galaxy is assumed stable. In other words, the stability of the system appears to be related to the existence of a minimum, finite unit of action, and therefore, ultimately, to quantum mechanics.

Detection of the Q series allows an estimate f the extinction toward these blobs from pairs of lines arising from the same upper level v=1-0S(1),Q(3),S(0),Q(2) (Beckwith etal.1979). These ratios ren-der an approx-imate visual extinction of 7mag. In our excitation diagrams, we compare the (un reddened) measured line ratios of several lines to the predictions of both anLTEmodelat2000K and a high-density photodissociation region model (Draine&Bertoldi,1996). The measured line ratios are well fit by a purely thermal single-temperature model of around 3000K. The low extinction measured suggests that a high-density PDR and a strong UV field can be ruled out in favor of a shock scenario. The confirmation of the shock nature of the line emission associated to nr114 therefore reinforces the hypothesis that this source is extremely young.
The specific ionization states indicated by the observed lines suggest that there are a number of components with different values of ξ,the density form of the ionization parameter. However, these all have the sa,ne value (Ξ=Ξc) of the pressure form of the ionization parameter. Above Ξc, low-temperature equilibria do not exist, and the temperature rises from ≃ 3×104Kto≃106K with Ξvery nearly constant at Ξc. If these components coex-ist at the same distance from the central source, they share the same pressure, suggesting a volume-filling configuration by which the pressure is regulated. If the volume-filling phase is the highest attainable temperature on the marginally stable branch of the thermal equilibrium curve, the actual distance could be substantially smaller than the maximum; a factor often smaller would not be surprising.

Conclusions
The non-thermalization in the closely neighborhood does not mean that there are no thermalized regions. When the local thermalization by the Hawking radiation is realized, the local temperature distribution T(r) should be a function of distance from the center of the black hole r because of its spherical symmetry. The Hawking radiation initially should thermal ize a sphere with the radius

Combining cluster membership with photometry allows for more accurate determinations of properties such as age, distance, and to some extent metallicity. Cluster membership is particularly important in crowded fields where field star contamination is high, because not only does it separate the cluster from the field, which allows for more accurate determination of the cluster properties, it also allows for specific selection of cluster stars for future observations with spectroscopy for elemental abundances.

Dwarf galaxies have long presented a particular challenge to CDM. Most people are now familiar with the problem that CDM models tend to produce steep luminosity functions and too many low-luminosity galaxies (e.g.,White&Frenk1991; Kauffmann, White, & Guide rdoni1993). It is usually assumed that this can be cured by invoking supernova(S N) feedback, but most models for SN feedback are currently quite ad hoc, and anl. is important to obtain better direct observational con-straints on this process. This is one of the reasons that the study of nearby dwarf galaxies is so important.

In conclusion, we have grown high-quality Y0.6Pr0.4Ba2Cu3O7/La2/3Ca1/3M nO3 superlattices. The interfacial reconstruction was studied by linearly polarized X-ray absorption at the CuL3-edge. Similar to the inter-face between optimally doped YBCO and LC MO, we observed dramatic modifications includ-ing charge transfer and OR at the interfacial CuO2planeofPr-dopedYBCO due to the strongly hybridized covalent bond between Cu and Mn. However, differences such as reduced charge transfer and more bulk-like orbital occupation were also: fou\nd. This is presumably related to the Pr-doping which removes holes from the ZR state and suppresses SC. Neutron reflectivity data revealed temperature-dependent, oscillatory diffuse scattering, indicative of a significant in-plane modulation, which can be attributed to buckling of the superlattice film due to the structural phase transition of the STO substrate.

We call this approximation concept P-near epoch dependence. It generalizes Lp-near epoch dependence, not requiring the existence of any moments, and is hence a fitting framework for nonparametric and robust data analysis.
To be certain, we shall stay with the second option.

This means that if one were to compare such a mass measured today with the same mass measured billions of years ago, I. he none could determine that there had been a change because apu rh number (in this case the number of nucleons in a star) was different.
We see that COrE and SPT / ACT can only be expected to measure mass for the most massive systems in the universe, while Planck can-not be expected to measure any individual cluster mass. The sensitivity of these experiments, however, is sufficient to obtain mean mass as a function of other cluster observables by binning measurements; in other words, to establish mean observable-mass scaling relations. Herein lies the value of our matched fil-ter approach, by providing a means of combining many low signal-to-noise measurements to statistically determine cluster mass. The sensitivity of SPT-Pol,SPT-3G/ACT-Pol and the PRISM mis-sion, on the other hand, is sufficient to enable individual cluster mass measurements as well as statistical studies.

In this Letter, we theoretically study the exciton dynamics and the resulting emission properties of linear chains carrying small-radius excitons. We account for both exciton localization by static disorder and scattering of the excitons on lattice vibrations. The interplay of nonequilibrium conditions and the local band-edge level structure of disordered chains leads to interesting effects in the emission. A comparison to experiment is made.

The universality of both charged and neutral weak interactions, combined with the discovery of predicted top quark, strongly suggests that the weak interac-tions are described by a gauge theory. Or in other words, the W±andZ0bosons are gauge bosons. This i\s a natural analogue of the fact that other known universal forces, namely gravity, which acts univeral lyon all bod-ies (equivalence principle), and electromagnetism, which gives universal Coulomb force which does not depend on the proper-ties of matter but only on their electric charges, are described by gauge theories. In fact, the universality was tile mha i-n motivation for Glashow to describe the weak interactions byhisSU(2)×U(1) gauge theory, or electroweak theory.

Many accidental band degeneracies, say the degeneracies in Weyl semi metals, are consid-ered to be protected by topology.

These distributions demonstrate a degree of insensitivity to the choice of merging scale, which has been varied over an order of magnitude, however there is still some residual dependence on this choice. While the parton shower and merged matrix element treatments formally have the same large logarithm behavior, there are differences be-tween the two. The degree of these differences will di-rectly influence the amount of residual de-pendence on the merging scale that is observed. In changing the merging scale we are changing the volume of the matrix element phase space region and therefore changing the proportion of parton emissions that are corrected by exact matrix elements.

We accompany our schemes by a rigorous theoretical anal-ysis of their running time. Both schemes double the number of processors if the current generation fails to produce an offspring that has larger fitness than the current best fitness value. Otherwise, if the generation yields an improvement, the number of processors is decreased again. The difference between the two schemes lies in the way the number of processors is decreased.

In this paper, we present a theoretical study of the current-induced dynamics of sky rm ions that correctly accounts for the effects of SOC on both current-induced torques and magnetization damping. Our results demonstrate that SOC generates reactive and dissipative homogeneous SO Ts that lead to important corrections to the drift velocity along the current direction and to the Magnus force. Another essential consequence of the SOC is that the sky rm ions experience effective damp-ing and torque parameters that depend on the current direction relative to the crystallographic axes.

Additionally, having the ability to provide correct protein domain analysis is a desirable property as well. Form A NM, the capability of offering correct motion analysis is a major requirement. The quality of both domain and motion analy-ses depends on how to design non-diagonal matrix elements so as to properly reflect the physical connectivity among particles.

It is interesting to note that the radio continuum source toward which the HI is detected (Figure 3) is the location where the radio jet begins to change its position angle. This would suggest that, as for exam-ple in the case of 3C236(Conway1999),theHI absorption marks the location of a jet / cloud interaction responsible for disturbing (and possibly bending) the jet. How-ever, the B2352+495 morphology is quite symmetric in both radio lobes which suggests that the deviation of the radio jets is not due to local jet / cloud interactions but governed by the large scale magnetohydrodynamic al properties of l.,he galactic nucleus. In the next section, we propose a different interpretation for the nature of the HI absorption in B2352+495.

We have also studied the moduli space of the supergravity solutions finding a total correspondence to the moduli space of gauge instantons in the case of instanton number one and we have shown that the natural measure on AdS spaces is exactly the measure of the partition function in instant on ic backgrounds. We have also discussed possible conjectures about the multi instant on measure.

The derivation of the drift velocity assumes that the dust, once separated from the gas shell, moves at a constant velocity. However, when the dust leaves the gas, the drag force due to collisions with the gas i:; appears and the radiation pdcs sure from the star again accelerates the cra i us. The equation of motion for grains that have separated from the gas is
As the strangeness contribution to the proton spin is positive for these configurations in apparent conflict with the experimental situation, as these are expected to require a relatively high energy of excitation, they are not likely to have a large probability in the proton.

ABSTRACT
We first define our data model in the general context, and then present the matched filter mass estimation by focussing on the idea J \ cAse where we have a clean map of lensed CMB anisotropies with only instrumental noise.

Entangled states, to which squeezed states are closely related, have been extensively studied in the last few ye\ars bec'au ~ of their potential application in quantum inform c,tl { } n processing and quantum computing. In this paper, we discuss squeezing and entanglement in terms of the quasiparticle modes of a trapped gas. Quasiparticle modes represent collective excitations of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and are in fact one of the most fundamental features of its dynamics. They are easily generated by applying time-dependent perturbations to the trapping potential, and were observed experimentally quite early on; they have since been studied in some detail both theoretically and experimentally.

Finally, the combination of the bandgap renormalization and the exciton screening tend to cancel and, consistent with experiments, the recombination energy re-mains relatively constant with ne. This result is plotted in figure 6but discussed at the end of section III.
So far, we assumed that the system size N (the number of cells) is constant, which is a good approximation for an adult organism; in a developing organism, however, proportion regulation has to work under the condi-tion of a steadily growing system size. Here, we study this problem for two simplified settings: first, for symmetric growth, i.e., new cells are added with proba-bility 1/2 on ei-ther side of the chain of cells, and the growth rate rg is constant on average; second, for homogeneous cell proliferation with probability pd per cell, assuming that daughter cells inherit the state of the mother cell.

Highly-charged ions con-stitute a test bed for the understanding of the electronic structure of matter, because they can be considered a subclass of atoms in which the basic physical parameters take on extreme values.
In sum-mary, we have found that aT Hz field may cause dynamical separations of the DNA double-strand. In the presence of weak perturbations e.g. thermal fluctuations, spr all amplitude response oc-curs (at half the driving frequency) either in a spatially uni-form manner or, at higher-frequencies, in an unusual spa-tially dimer ized form. In the latter case, neighboring base pairs oscillate in an out-of-phase fashion. However, large localized openings (bubbles) in the DNA double strand can only occur via a nonlinear mechanism requiring a spatial perturbation above a certain amplitude thr ébold that is determined by the intensity and the frequency of the THz field.
Evolving domains
Our method has been developed for a particular kind of RCT design. The RCT must have two arms, one continuous endpoint, and the observations must be independent. Imple-menting extensions to longitudinal or panel data, to binary, count and survival outcomes, and more than two arms are challenging next steps.
while the change of frame formula (0.2)is
Finally, in the case of coincident quantum critical points the transition remains second order and the finite temperature behavior can be extracted from the scaling properties of the quantum bi critical point.

Using numerical simulations allows us to quickly explore many possible definitions of the scaling constants with little uncertainty in, for example, the total galaxy mass or velocity dispersion. The simulated galaxie sale of course imperfect stand-ins for actual galaxies, but our hope is that working with simulated galaxies will allow us to eliminate many of the definitions that are possible and focus on one (or a few) that seem to work well. Only the most successful choices when compared to simulations will be considered including the additional complications inherent to observational data.

We have shown that diffuse interface methods while already being very powerful can be further generalized. We illustrated that non-smooth potentials are a viable option for the separation of data. While the computations become more expensive due to the nonlinearity that is treated with the semi-smooth Newton scheme, the results in many cases show that the results are even better than for the smooth l)ot eri tial. Additionally, we showed that the methods are not limited to the graph Laplacian setup but can successfully be employed for the hypergraph Laplacian. Future work should incorporate more sophisticated eigenvalue methods and our goal is to further investigate different techniques for the segmentation of hypergraphs.

Initially l;bIn problems were solved by the introduction of color-octet (CO) components of the quark on ia, that arise a tura Uy in the non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD), where the expansion over the rela-tive velocity of quarks in meson is performed. In this model it is assumed, that final meson is formed from heavy quark pair in color-octet state, that subsequently transforms into a physically observed col-orless meson. In the framework of NRQCD the probabilities of these transitions are described by the matrix elements of four-fermion operators, that are determined from the experi rn (~ ntal distributions over the transverse momentum of final charmonium. We would like to stres8, ho?wever, that this explanation will not work for charmonium production at lower energies. The reason is that the distributions caused by octet compo-nents decreases slowly with the rise of the transverse momentum, but the probability to find such a component in the meson is small, compared with the singlet case. As a result, in the large transverse momentum region the contribution of octet components can be significant, but for small energies and transverse momenta it is suppressed.

Stationary cyclic Gaussian processes
The statistical uncertainties of the eclipse maps were estimated with a Monte Carlo procedure (e.g.,Ruttenetal.I992).Asetof20 artificial lightcurves is generated, in which the data points are independently and randomly varied according to a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation equal to the uncertainty at that point. The light curves are fitted with the eclipse mapping algorithm to produce a set of randomized eclipse maps. These are combined to produce an average map and 0,tnap of the residuals with respect to the average, which yields the statistical uncertainty at each pixel.

Swimming is accom-plished by the internal degrees of freedom, the controls, undergoing periodic cycles. An example of a q-swimmer might be a molecule immersed in a quantum gas. The control of the internal configuration might be either external (through lr,l ~ application of external fields) or internal (ue to autonomous dynamics).

In classical theory of PDEs, two important classes of equations are: elliptic and parabolic PDEs. They are second-order PDEs, with some constraints (coercive ness) in the higher-order terms. The elliptic equations typically model the flow of some chemical quantity within some region, whereas the parabolic equations model the time evolution of such quantities. Consider the following particular classes of elliptic and parabolic equations:

Noise of the ty lf ~ modelled here can be distinguished from other noise sources. For instance, in trapped-ion systems, if Johnson-Nyquist noise is the dominant source of fluctuating electric fields, this will predominantly originate in the attendant electronics in the system, rather than the ion-trap electrodes themselves. Consequently the noise level varies as a function of the temperature of the electronics. In contrast, noise due to dielectric coverings on the electrodes varies as a function of the electrode temperature, which can be controlled independently of the attendant electronics.

Classification of four-dimensional smooth manifolds up to i.f feo morph is ln can best be understood, strangely enough, by look-ing first at the classification of smooth man-ifolds up to diffeomorphism in greater than four dimensions.

The construction of previous sections can thus be performed for the WZ cae wiith few modifications.

The paper is organized a ~ follows. In Scc, II, we define the entanglement entropy for a snapshot, which is a key ingredient in this t paper, and present outline of our method. Then, mSec. III, basic properties of the ent angl ment entropy and the entanglement spectrum for square-lattice Ising ferromagnet are presented. The main objective is to show temperature and system-size de-pendence of the entropy as well as the spectrum in order to extract scaling relations. We also examine entanglement sup-port of our method by changing the number of the singular values which are taken into account. In Sec. IV, coarse-grained snapshots are shown, and we discuss about the key mechanism of the length-scale control hidden in the SVD.InSec.V,weexaminethe3 - state Potts model in order to confirm universality of our scaling relations obtained in the analysis of the Ising model. In Sec. VI, we discuss about the topological entanglement entropy in a viewpoint of the entanglement gap. Finally, we summarize our results.
Thus, we now fix U and V with this condition.

This pa-per is organized as follows. In section 2, the setup considered here is described and generalized Einstein equations with time dependence are explicitly expressed. In the simplest case of an isolated tw-bra lil (; system, we give the higher dimensional Friedmann-type equation on the brane. In section 3,wesolvethestatic(5+D) - dimensional Randall-Sundrum model with the bulk cosmological constant Λ.For each case of Λ<0,Λ>0,andΛ=0,the(4+D) - dimensional metric functions can be obtained. We show that the forms of the warped metric functions and the relation between the brane tensions on the orbifold depend on the inte-gration constant appearing in the Einstein equations as well as on the sign of the bulk cosmological constant. A summary and discussion are given in the final section. In an appendix, were view the Kasner so-lution of the (4+D) - dimensional anisotropic cosmological model.
T be re is no reason to believe the above approximation when b<l NC. In this case the interactions between an instant on and an anti-instanton is welt described by the gauge fields which are low energy modes of IIB matrix model. They are close to diagonal degrees of freedom in IIB matrix model. Their contri-bution can be estimated by gauge theory. The one loop effective potential can be calculated by gauge theory certainly when b<<l NC
From the annealed approximation we expect the stationary distribution not to depend on l, but in fact we could oI) serve different behaviours for different lvalues. So the data analysis is rather complex since for every point (K,ρ)in parameter space three var able s,N,t and l, are involved and different limits, e.g.N large at fixed t and lort and l large at fixed N, may give different behaviours.
We expect that massive stars are likely to be responsible for the sig-nificant number of bright red infrared matches to the hard X-ray sources in the Sgr B region. Indeed, this area contains the most massive molecular cloud known in the Galaxy, inwivichbver60 ultra-compact Hii regions are embedded (Gau meetal.1995;dePreeetal.1998). Naturally, this is a site of vigorous, massive star formation. Infrared spectroscopy of red matches in this region will likely reveal hot supergiants, similar to those already identified near the Arches and Quintuple t clusters. The identification of such stars nearS grB will constrain the history and mode of massive star formation in this region.

Extensive calculations obtained with three independent stellar evolution codes have enabled us to consistently induce or remove GNL s according to the helium-composition profile at the end of core-helium burning. We have shown that GNL s are not favored by higher metallicities or lower masses, as postulated by Bonoetal.(1997a,b).Rather,GNLs are produced by the narrowness of the helium-burning region when tile helium-burning shell ignites immediately following core-helium exhaustion. This is most influenced by the way that the convective and semi convective regions are calculated at the completion of core-helium burning and further illustrates our incomplete knoW lq lge of this complicated phase. If we could observationally determine the existence, or otherwise, of GNL s, it would be a direct probe into the helium profile at helium exhaustion and hence provide information about the occurrence of core-breathing pulses.
To complete the proof of The orem4.1,we summarize our situation: we have a nontrivial semi-simple group De ruc(H) with an irreducible unitary representation. Furthermore, it has a special element x whose im-age under there int ebsen q; al;ian has exactly two distinct eigenvalues whose ratio is not ± 1.
Another im-portant aspect is that for many quantities of phenomenological relevance, there ex lst a large number of calculations using different actions, different approaches to renormalization, etc. Furthermore, lattice theorists are curious to try out new approaches so that more recent does not necessarily imply more reliable or accurate. The situation can thus be very confusing for non-experts, as it is even for experts! It would therefore be very use-ful to have a body of theoreticians well versed in the different possible lattice approaches, which could review the situation and provide a succinct and reliable summary of the state of the art. We also owe it to ourselves to make the best possible use of the results and experience that we have accumulated.

In this paper we have studied the fluid squeeze-out from the interface between an elastic block with a flat sur-face and a randomly rough surface of a rigid solid. We have calculated the (average) interfacial separation as a function of time by considering the fluid flow using a contact mechanics theory in combination with th i!l fil na hydrodynamics with flow factors (which are functions of the (local) interfacial separation) obtained using a recently developed theory. We have explained the importance of the large length-scale elastic deformations on the squeeze out.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that the Coulomb re-pulsion can bound electrons in multi-well periodic structures, so that a current ofer it atl le(I electrons with opposite spins would appear.

So far we have discussed emission in constant classical fields. However, one of the defining features of a QED-plasma is that the emission processes can influence these fields. Radiation reaction exerts a drag force, altering the velocity of the electrons and positrons and so altering the current in the plasma. Although no net current is produced in the pair production process, it acts as a source of current carriers. Subsequent acceleration by the background fields separates the electron and positron which then alter the current in the plas-ma. These modifications to the current effect the evolution of the macroscopic fields.

In conclusion, the DM interpretation of the 3 events reported by the CDMS-II collaboration is not entirely excluded by XENON10/100. This mass region is very interesting theoretically and can be accessed with relatively small ex-periments employing light target nuclei. In view of our ignorance concerning the possible interactions ofDM, it is essential that experimental searches employ as many different target nuclei as is possible.
Since we identify the AD flat direction as the inflaton that has an initial value larger than the Planck mass in the chaotic inflation, the supergravity effects should be taken into account. In the framework of supergravity, the effective potential is modified as
In fact,
Not allstars that are born in binaries are expected to show this peculiar chem-istry from A GB accre-tion. Close binaries can not evolve up the AGB because they undergo mass transfer before or during shell hydrogen burning on the first giant branch. Very wide binaries have stars that are so far separated that they do not interact except through their mutual gravitational attraction. The intermediate cases are those which interest us: the binary must be wide enough to allow evolution up the AGB, but close enough that there is mass transfer (probably) by wind accretion.
At this point it is important to examine whether NSIc an obscure the discovery of the standard CP violation due to δand the neutrino mass hierarchy, and if yes to what extent.

Marginal sub-criticality of the ISM on average is probably no coincidence (Shuetal.1999). Heavily supercritical gas clouds have long since eot Iap sedco he form stars. To induce the remaining clouds to collapse, any process has to overcome their notional stability. Successful processes only form stars with a low efficiency per unit collapse timescale because magnetic flux on a large scale can not be destroyed but can only be redistributed. Thus, gas that becomes supercritical and collapses can only do so by making the remain-ing gas more subcritical and less prone to collapse.

Finally, let us note that one single definite example of unstable physically relevant solution in the theory with higher derivatives would mean that the situation with the (in)stability of vacuum in this theory becomes definitely negative. In view of the great relevance of higher derivatives, especially for quantization of matter fields on curved background, this would mean the necessity of some dra-matic changes in our understanding, starting from the semiclassical approach to gravity. However, after considerations presented in this work, we have an expec-tation that the situation with higher derivatives in a theory based on a unique Planck scale can be resolved.

The spectra of supernova remnants are very similar to those of foreground stars. Following P04 we assumed that all foreground stars have been identified from the correlation with optical data leaving any remaining sources that fit the HR criteria as supernova remnant candidates. Again, HRs were calculated for typical supernova remnant spectra (absorbed thermal plasma models with temperatures of 0.5keVand1.0keV) over the same range of column densities as before. All the HRs calculated were within the original criteria and so the criteria were not modified.

Because it is often desirable to look at Feynman diagrams for the process being calculated, Mad Graph generates a postscript file with these diagrams and the amplitude they correspond to in the code. In principle, graph generation should be trivial once all of the particles and vertices are determined. However, determining anesthetic arrangement of the vertices and particles requires some thought. The algorithm used in Mad Graph minimizes the sum of the length squared of the lines, This does not always produce perfectly symmetric diagrams, however it is a fairly easy procedure to implement and the diagrams are adequate for research purposes. For each four-gluon vertex thc re are actually three identical graphs rather than just one. This is necessary to account for the three differ-ent color factors in a single four gluon ver-tex.

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Setting
It remains to adapt the PF allocation to account for practical placement constraints that occur in data centers. These include the requirement to allocate CPU and RAMon the same server, for example, or to use a specific type of server for some jobs. It is also of interest to incorporate hierarchical scheduling criteria whereby the departments originat-ing certain classes of jobs have overall service rate guarantees. Available trace data suggests cluster resources are currently significantly over-provisioned so that optimized sharing is hardly an issue in practice. In future, however, one would expect tighter en-ergy management leading to a requirement for more closely controlled performance. The key to this would be analytical modelling enabling one to predict performance given sys-tem capacity and load, by applying t be robust engineering techniques developed over recent years for networks, for example.

Furthermore, note that for the case of the normal layer thickness tN being comparable to the spin diffusion length λsd the measured voltage depends only very weakly on either value, since tN/λsdtanh(tN/2λsd) is approximately constant.

It is well established that, in the context of Newtonian dynamics, the observable mass inspiral galaxies can not account for tile ` ob\se i-v ed flat rotation curves in the outer regions of galaxies (Bosma1978;Begeman1987,vanA lbadaetal.1985).Tile standard explanation for this discrepancy is the proposal that galaxies are embedded in an extended dark halo which dominates the gravitational field in the outer regions (Trimble 1987).
But there is absolutely nothing granting us that this Boolean description (thought necessary to exert experiments) will exhaust the scenario in which phenomena appear. And this lies at the heart of the existence of complementary (and incompatible) contexts in quantum mechanics: in order to determine the state of the system, a quantum tomography must be exerted, and thus, we are obliged to study the system in different incompatible contexts. While the structuration of experience in CM can be reduced to a boolean algebra (and thus, to a set theoretical description provided by an outcome set), in QM this is no longer possible. In classical mechanics, the gor yes a rip tion (of an object can be equated with its space-time representation: form the point of view of classical mechanics, the main goal is to describe continuous motion of material bodies inside space. Th~+t is why motion (and change) can be described as the solutions of deterministic differential equations. And this feature is much more general than the usual description of a particle mov-ing through space under the action of forces. Any quantity of interest taking continuous values, if it is classical, will have associated a time derivative, and thus the description reduces to the motion of a system in a phase space obeying deterministic differential equations. Quite contrarily, quantum mechanics is characterized by jumps, by discontinuous and unpre-dictable behavior. That is why the organization of experience in QM comes endowed with a probabilistic description: it is impossible to predict the future events with complete certainty, and thus, the actual state of affairs is just a probability distribution.

If the brane has a finite width, or if it isnt infinitely well localized, the exchange of KK modes will be suppressed for KK wavelength slac shorter than the width of the brane, or the size of its fluctuations. This will there-fore give an effective cut-off (denoted Ms) for high KK masses, which does not have to be of the sam (~ magnitude as the fundamental Planck mass MD.

The largest deviation was found for the case K=3, where the annealed approximation gives α=0.182 while our simulations give αL=0.210,αT=0.204,αP=0.21andαV=0.206 for the average variance in a given network and 0.205 for the variance between different networks.
It was recently realized that this approach described in the previous section (i.e. to predict the behavior of the system from the knowledge of the equations of motion) fails in the case of complex systems for reasons that are very similar (al-beit in a different contest) to those which led to the abandonment of the Newton-Laplace view-point.
In conclusion, the results of this section show us that the computation of the eigenstates and the eigenvalues of the spl(2|1) model is still dependent of an additional eigenvalue problem for the inhomogeneous transfer ma-trix T(1)(λ,{λi }). We shall discuss this matter in the next section.

Knowing the relative position and peculiar velocity of each galaxy with respect to its host cluster it is easy to reproduce observations of that cluster in the form of projected cluster-centric radii and LOS velocity. The 30 systems are then stacked, scaling each by the cluster radius (r500) and velocity dispersion, σv. This stacking over many clusters is not required simply to match our observed sample, or even tom contain sufficient galaxies to derive robust statistical properties (although this is important), but most importantly to even out all of the large line-of-sight variations due to the presence of infalling s true tures or filaments for individual cluster lines of sight and times of observation. This applies both for the simulations and the observations, motivating our use of such large clus-ter samples.

Each A I/ATP instance thus produces its specific temporary file (the FOF ATP problem) and runs its specific ATP system on it with its time limit.

Vampire and Epar already do such scheduling internally: the current version of Epar runs a fixed schedule of 14 strategies, while Vampire runs a problem-dependent schedule of several to dozen of strategies. Assuming one strategy for Z3 and on average eight strategies for Vampire, this now means that using 10-CPU parallelization results in about 100 different proof - (lata./featnre-extyractiou / learning / premise-s lIcing/ATl'-strale?yin3tan tia-tions tried by the online service within the 30 seconds of the real time allowed for each query.

According to the results presented above, emission mechanisms appear i herd it ter-e nL in the two models. For light particles, a more abundant pre-equilibrium emis-sion (Z<3) is observed in the BG BD case. Concerning the IMF emission mechanism, the involved time scales and the relative importance of one-and many-body effects appear different in the two mod-els, due to the differences in the implementation of mean-field propagation and two-body scattering. In the BG BD case the fragmentation process follows the spinodal decomposition scenario. Indeed the systen? enters the low density region as an early homogeneous source, then density fluctuations are amplified. The formation of bubble-like structures i s~\avored, as a manifestation of monopole instabilities. In the AMD model, many-body correlations have a stronger impact on the fragmentation dynamics, while mean-field effects appear weaker. Fragment formation seems not to be directly linked with the spinodal decomposition scenario, but rather with the appearance of some pre-fragments at earlier times. As a consequence, fragments are formed on shorter time-scales in AMD. Finally, we observe that pre-equilibrium and IMF emissions happen on different time scales and are related to differ-ent mechanisms in the BG BD case, while in AMD the distinction of the two timescales is not as clear as in BG BD.
Labeling all words with a spec\i llc tag yields maximal recall for that tag, as all words occurrence of that tag are labeled correctly, yet = it h the price of low precision, as many words are tagged wrongly. On the other hand, not labeling even one word (or labeling all word with the special tag of no tag) yields maximal precision for all tags, as there is not even a single word that is labeled mistakenly by so mt', tag, yet the precision is zero as none of the words that should be tagged are indeed tagged. \ [' ie al'l yo no can move from the second extreme to the first dby?lab4lingor tagging more and more words with some tag. In various information extraction systems it is desirable to have the ability to control the tradeoff between high precision or high recall. In some scenarios a user may prefer that the system may label fewer words with a tag (low recall) yet to have the labeled words be tagged correctly (high precision), and in another scenarios the opposite is preferred, that is, labeling more words with some tag, yet at the price of low precision.

On the other hand, if the attack is launched on Flow2(thatskipstheFTP upload to the base station), it may not be as easy to detect. Since the attack uses the same functions that are invoked by legitimate code, it looks like the application is following Flow1 (where the FTP upload is actually legitimate). In this case, only 1 % of the malicious code executions were caught. The detection rates would be significantly higher if the attacker either used different images that vary in size or used code that utilizes different combinations of system calls. The latter case would also hold for the HTTP pos + attack. Note: the detection was not successful bec~use we tailored the attack instance to closely match legitimate execution (especially due to our knowledge of the detection methods); however, many attacks will not be able to match legitimate execution in such a precise manner and will end up being caught.

Moreover, we obtained that present method predicts not only the eigenvalues as well as the eigenfunctions of given potentials. The correspondence of wave functions for lower energy levels is very good agreement with numerical results as expected the except case nand l are large. The method used in this study present an easy way of calculating both eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of power-law and logarithmic potentials. In spite of its simple structure, the method is very practical and the results of the method are in good agree me\t with exact results.

At first glance it may seem that applying ridge rare gr?ev sill to the covariance matrix should be detrimental to determining the actual values of correlation function parameters: we are effectively assuming by fiat that the effective covariance matrix to be used in calculating χ2 differs from what was measured. Since ridge regression yields larger values for the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix than the data themselves would suggest, the results are equivalent to a situation with larger nominal measurement uncertainties (and hence broader χ2minima) than implied by the original covariance matrix.

In the Lagrangian formalism, perturbations are described by the Lagrangian displacement vector ξa. The complete description of a perturbation requires the solution of the perturbed field, Euler and energy conservation equa-tions for the metric perturbation haband the displacement vector ξa. If one can solve all but one of the above equations, using for example atrial vector ξa, then the remaining equation will not be satisfied. One then has to construct a criterion, which will be used to identify the equilibrium star for which the remaining equation is? sti Wes fled.

Molecular dynamics models usually assume a fixed Gaussian shape for the single particle wave functions. Them any-body state is r presented by a simple product wave function, with or without anti symmetrization. In this way, though single particle wa',,e functions are supposed to be independent (mean-field approximation), the use of localized wave packets induces many-body correlations both in mean-field propagation and hard two body scattering (collision integral), that is treated stochastically. From the point of view of sto-chastic mean-field models, the philosophy of molecular dy-namics would be to introduce a special kind of fluctuation by stochastically localizing the single particle wave functions.

Conclusion
Thus, the origin of both soft photons and reflection are unlikely to be matter mixed inside the hot Compton ising plasma. In the framework of the cloud models this suggests that the cold clouds should be essentially external to the hot Compton ising plas-ma. Then the radiative cooling is much less efficient and the reflection component may be larger. Variations in the covering factor and the distribution of the clouds may even produce a c-ore l6t~ou,betweenRandΓ(ase.g. in the spherical case considered by M01).

A crucial feature of DDEs is that they need an infinite set of initial conditions to be integrated. This set is usually called history and provides the state of the system before the action of the delayed terms. Sometimes history is set randomly, although given the sensitivity of some systems with delay and the difficulties arising when an infinite set of initial random points is needed, the choice of random histories is a delicate issue. A bet l;er option is to set the history as the solution of the system without the delayed terms. Another possibility are history functions described by some parameters and properly chosen for each physical situation.

These observations motivates us to investigate the possibility of taking advantage of this performance difference of different s.ystem for a more effective score fusion method. To this goal we investigated training a separate score fusion model for ei?c b duration condition, however this method could not give the expected gain in accuracy due to the fact that by splitting the available data for training score fusion, and training multiple models, the effectiveness of these models decrease. How-ever, still some improvement in the overall accuracy of the systems was observed.

Because in this case the excitation never stops, energy keeps entering the system and the flow never reaches any kind of stationary state, due to its lack of a dissipative mechanism. One sees excitations emerging continuously and vortices seem to appear and disappear at the edges of the cloud. At the same time, one sees localized excitations, where the velocity is large, mostly accu-mulating at the edges of the cloud. We believe these are acoustic excitations. At the final stages of the video the images hardly allows to discern if there are vortex tangles inside the cloud, since most of the velocity excitations, as mentioned, are accumulated at the borders of the clouds.
The above discussion shows that the interaction between DE and DM can lead to a constant r. Although it is not clear how to obtain a rofO(1)sizeat early times, this simple strategy can be used to account for particular situation s(e.g. late time evolution of the universe). Nevertheless, there is no strong motivation for setting r to be a constant. It is wbrlhphr-hiumelet6 explore some more realistic models in which r varies slowly with time.

The starting point in our work are these two contributions. c We foll w individual phonons in a space divided into cells. The phonons after adrift phase are able to interact and to be scattered. The speed and the rate at which phonons scatter depends on the frequency. We ensure that energy is conserved after each scattering process. This procedure is different whether the phonons interact through aN processor aU process. This paper is therefore an improvement of existing phonon Monte Carlo methods and is validated on simple examples such as a semiconductor film heated at two different temperatures.

In dealing with the evidence ratio for repeated trials, we will thus use the prior twice. The standard Bayesian approach regards the data as being fixed specific numbers, and the prior enters only when we average the likelihood function over the prior to obtain the posterior probabilities. However, when we view the Bayesian outputs as statistics, we have to treat the data as random variables, whose distribution will depend on the values of the parameters for which rre here vea prior. The probabil-ity distribution of the evidence ratio involves the data, and so depends on the unknown parameters that are the argument of the prior. We can elimi state these parameters by a further integration over the prior, in effect, marginalizing the distribution of the evidence ratio to obtain its p Black wOh bi~lt y distribution independent of parameters.
The hypothesis that the deep structure of spacetime is a discrete poset characterises causal set theory at the kinematical level; that is, it is a proposition about what substance is the subject of the theory.

In this section, we present our results for the phase diagrams of the NJL model with u,d, and squarks. We plot the phase diagrams as a function of the chemical potentials and temperature. To determine the locations of the phase boundaries, we examine the behavior of the condensates. If a con-densate jumps discontinuously the transition is first-order, and this is indicated by a solid line. If its derivative has a discontinuity, the transition is second order, and this is indicated by a dotted line. If a condensate changes rapidly in a narrow range with-out vanishing there is a smooth cross-over, and bisnis indicated by a dashed-dotted line at the point were the condensate varies maximally.
Our results support a close association between the radio source and the CME expansion for both events, as shown bi the close relation between the type-II-emitting shock segment and the EUV wave, which clearly was produced by the CME.

Using Gaussian diffusion for image filtration has one great drawback: its homogeneity, which leads to un-wanted diffusion of image features like edges. The idea behind the Perona-Malik equation is to modify the heat equation by adding the diffusivity coefficient depending on space activity in a given part of a picture, measured by the norm of the local picture gradient. For small gradient norm (homogeneous regions) large values of the diffusivity are expected, to perform stronger smoothing. In regions with big gradient norm (inhomogeneity) smaller diffusivity is expected, to slow down the diffusion process and protect delicate im-age features. Hence, the precise Per on a-Malik problem formulation with a Neumann boundary condition is

Concluding remarks
The actual degree of distortion of surface state wave functions in the z \ direction due to interactions with inner layers requires numerical calculations and is beyond I he scope of this paper. Wave function distortion in the z direction, however, does not invalidate group theoretical calculations because z direction distorted wave functions are still ba-sis functions of wallpaper groups. Distortions of wave functions only change the magnitude of coupling constant s between surface states and bulk states.

Thus far our discussion ofF-duality has been confined to a rather restricted class of black hole solutions, initially focussing on the charges carried by those solutions and then in terms of the effective potential describing their scalar dynamics.

The flux density scale is likely accurate to about 5%forX-b and, high declination sources, but degrades to 20-30%forQ-band, and especially the low-declination sources. The gain (phase and amplitude) calibration was carried out in the normal manner-after initial bandpass and de-lay calibration were made using the flux-density calibrators.

Figures 7 shows the time evolution of the hardness x calculated using the numerically determined central velocity disper-sion (the maximum value anywhere within the system.) The ver-tical extent of the line seg-m;ent indicates tber mLse of the hardness implied by the initial binary binding energy distribution. The figure shows that during the period before the phase of maximum contraction, the binaries are hard so, in a thermal distribution, one would expect them to harden, not disrupt. As a result, the early binary de•etrucMem1n (when hardening is expected) is noteworthy. Moreover, after the transition all the binaries are soft and, in a thermal distribution, would tend to become softer. As a result, the binary hardening observed at the end of the simulation for the largest initial binding energies is noteworthy.

In this man-uscript we report evidence of temporal vectorial DS in a single mode Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) enclosed into a polarization sensitive double external cavity. By ex-ploiting the two different times of flight as well as the polarization se-lectivity of the cavity, we are able to control the polarization state of light and generate vectorial DS. They consist in time-localized r\oi, at ious of the emitted polarization orientation, thus leaving the total intensity constant. When the cavity round-trip is much longer than the duration of the vectorial DS, several independent DS and / orDS bound states (molecules) may be hosted in the cavity where they coexist with the background solution (zero DS emission). We show that molecules and independent DS can be discriminated experimentally by analyzing their noise-induced motion.

Preliminary calculations showed that the polar on would be very small at strong coupling, so we first performed searches of the solution for strong coupling parameters on small clusters. We used both the differential a I gorithm and conjugate gradient algorithm using random starting conditions. This generally produced a few low energy configurations. We then used these configurations as starting conditions for a sweep towards zero coupling strength. We would find the lowest energy configuration for a given λ,and then use that configuration as the starting po in ~ for the next lower λcalculation. This avoided getting lost in multi-dimensional phase space. We did other surveys for starting configurations that were not low energy solutions at strong coupling, but in these cases only the trivial solution of a free electron im-mersed in a lattice of unstretched bonds was found.

Conclusion
Traditionally, detailed mod-eling of IRradiation involved numerous input quantities, necessitating a large number of calculations to obtain suc-cessful fits, and diluting the value of the resulting success. However, as pointed out by RR, the number of relevant parameters can be drastically reduced by employing the scaling properties af the radiative transfer problem. For example, the luminosity of the central source is irrelevant, a fact by and large ignored in modeling astronomical sources.
Let us now concentrate on the case of three bosons(N=3).ThePR(t) in this case is defined as,

The time history of the radio emission is s-+hown in Fig.6cand6d. The volume-averaged radio emissivity is plotted in Fig.6c. The en-hancement of the radio emission by the cloud interaction is once again much more evident in the ring-cloud case and more pronounced than the relativistic electron energy enhancement because magnetic energy increases, which are greater during the cloud encounter, are more important to the radio emission. In general, the radio luminosity is an increasing function of time throughout the interval we have s1,udied?

Thus, despite gauge interactions connecting the strongly coupled matter and weakly coupled fermions over a large hierarchy, it would appear that a high degree of SUSY is accidentally maintained in the light composites, permitting a substantial hierarchy between Λcomp and the mass of light cbm po site scalars. But again, it is interesting that this hierarchy can not naturally be too large. This sour extension of the mechanism of Partial SUSY. We shall make more quantitative illustrative estimates in Section 7.

The value of the enhancement depends on to what extent we take into account many-body corrections in the non-singular self-energy.

The first clear result visible from the lightcurves is that the variations in the different X-ray bands are all correlated. Indeed, these intensive monitoring s with high time resolution and long duration allow detailed measurements of the inter-band cross correlation properties, and in particular to make quantitative estimates of the degree of cor-relati ol lan?d of any lags between variations at different X-ray wavelengths. Two cross correlation methods, namely the Discrete Cora. wdl M)l elation Function (DCF) and Modified Mean Deviation (MMD), are applied. In the following, a positive lag indicates the higher energy X-rays leading the lower energy { } nes, while negative indicates the opposite.
The exponential and the power-law expansion profiles used in this work set the basis for quantifying the details of nucleosynthesis mechanisms. Their low computational cost allows the monitoring of large-scale and small-scale equilibrium patterns among nuclear reactions in time, which is a powerful tool for identifying microscopic components that affect the composition of the ejecta.

One apparent distinction between the analytic result and Pythia is that the double differential cross section in Pythia vanishes in the region near the line eα=e β,while it does not in the NLL cross section. We attribute this difference to angular ordering / veto imposed in the Monte Carlo. The line eα=e βrequires that all emissions contributing there are located at θ=R0, the edge of the jet. Such a configuration is exponentially suppressed in a Monte Carlo, but is allowed in our NLL expression for the du,b lm('e differential cross section.

Conselice(2004) suggested that the early build-up phase of galaxy formation, corresponding to z>3, is dominated by major uer gers, the intermediate phase at1<z<2 is dominated by hydrodynamic gas accretion, and the late phase (z<1) is dominated by minor mergers. He noted that Luminous Diffuse Objects, which are morphologically similar to clump clusters, have bright outer regions with low central light concentrations, and so might be examples of the intermediate phase. The signature for this may be present in the age and mass distributions of the clump and inter clump regions, studied here.

Buffering architectures and policies for their efficient management constitute one of the core ingredients of a network architecture. In this work we intro-duce a new specification language, BASEL, that allows to express virtual buffering architectures and management policies representing a variety of economic models. BASEL does not require the user to implement policies in a high-level language; rather, the entire buffering architecture and its policy are reduced to sev-eral comparators and simple functions. We show examples of buffering architectures in BASEL and demonstrate empirically the impact of various settings on performance.
First we define the notion of an influence function. Given an initially nacl il'e setA that is a subset oF Va cd influ once probabilities, the influence func-tion denoted by σ(A) is the expected number of active nodes at the end of the? dtr l u\s iou process. The influence maximization problem is, given a parameter k,a social network graph G,anda model of information diffusion, to find a set of knode sinG to be activated initially (also known as target set) such that, it will maximize the influence function σ(A).
This result can be summarized as follows: two charges born in the same quantum state, and therefore expected to radiate coherently, will become two independent emitters when traversing an opaque medium, in effect loosing memory of their origin. As a consequence, angular ordering in the parton shower should be partially (or completely) destroyed.

Nonperturbative corrections to infrared safe Jt et cross sections and event shapes are an important issue in the study of QCD.

In the csse of a tomography experiment, it is not enough to fit a single spectrum, but the entire series must be reproduced by a single set of input data. There may be solutions that fit a single spectrum better than the one f,i?naly adopted, but the overall result may not be as good as that obtained with a different set. Therefore, a double compromise must be reached, on a set of input parameters that give both acceptable individual fits and on a fair reproduction of the spectral evolution.

In the simplified version of the model the oscillating wtuI1im parts momentum to the particle. How-ever, it is assumed that it takes a stationary position. So the time interval spent by the particle in the travel between collisions does not depend on the phase of the oscillating wall. The simplified versions are widely studied because they are useful under some aspects. For example, they allow to obtain analytical results that can be extended to the complete versions and, usually, they speed up greatly the simulation x tss when compared to the corresponding complete versions.

Moreover, why away-side ridges? By considering mainly the central collisions, we tried to understand the origin of the ridge structure, especially the away-side one.

The spa-tial probability distribution for the first particle is determined by the mean-field density, and so is the second. However if all the particles move around in a correlated way, e.g. because the system is bond, a measurement of the first particle will determine the systems center-of-mass with high accuracy. A measurement of a second particle will be close to the center-of-mass, and condensation is lost.

Conclusion and future directions
One parameter that has In%Heres nnn er-i-ng implications on our understanding of planetary formation is the relative inclination between the orbital plane of the observed planet and that of the presumed interacting planet for the cases of single KOIswithsigpificantTTVs. Relative inclination can induce a precession of the orbital mo-{on of the observed planet, which can manifest it-self in a modulation of the transit duration and depth. Although the focus of the present work is on the T TVs, the catalog, which includes derived TD Vs and TPV s,can, in princi-ple, help to identify systems with a rel-ative inclination.

I. INTRODUCTION
The equilibrium configuration of beta-stable matter is obtained at each total baryon number density nB and temperature; by min-imizing th6 total free energy F with respect to the two-body correlation functions, effective masses and proton abundance np/n B subject to the constraints of equations (2),(6,67),(9)and(25).
Divide this algebra by a two sided ideal defined liac kn elements of the form:
the second term does not contribute to the total number of levels. As is well known for the ch GUE the large n-limit of the first term is a semicircle. In the normalization (4.2) of the distribution of the matrix elements, the average level density does not depend on β(see appendix A). The second term in (6.1) therefore does not contribute to the average level density. From the asymptotic formula for the Laguerre polynomials (seeeq.(C.2)), it follows that in the thermodynamic limit (n≫1)

Extracting the fundamental parameters
In the present paper we are aim-ing at describing soft X-ray absorption and emission processes involving two shells. Hence, we can define the Hilbert space associated to this problem by only considering the electrons involved in these two shells. For a shell determined by the quantum numbers (n,l)andcn-tainlngk electrons, the dimension of the Hilbert space is:
It is worth noting that the uncertainties of the mixing parameters in other representations can not be evaluated through error propagation using the uncertainties of the mixing parameters obtained in the conventional representation. This is because the covariances of any two mixing parameters in the conventional representation are not provided. One way to obtain the uncertainties of the mixing parameters in any representation is through global fits of the experimental data using various representations. This will be reported in a separate article.

We begin by defining our units of prediction (queries and ads) and the mechanism used to select them (auctions). We assume a fixed, existing prediction system provides a raw prediction for each ad; our study will then concern prediction maps, functions that at-tempt to map these raw predictions to calibrated probabilities. Once this framework is established, we can formally state the questions we study.

In addition to the reduced visibility, the phase of the interferometer fluctuates. If the phase fluctuates on the the time scale of the acquisition time this would further decrease the visibility. However, we find the ~ I phase drifts rather slowly, by approximately 0.01rad in one minute.
The non-shuffling cyclic ordering?s the easiest to code and has the cheapest per-iteration cost because shuffling requires pseudo-random number generation, which can be time consuming, especially when each inner iteration step is simple. Shuffling, however, avoids the worst ordering and, depending on the application, can accelerate the convergence.

Our main limitation is the difficulty distinguishing between similar roads. When a vehicle stops at an intersection and then accelerates slowly a turn or straight path are both possible, so our algorithm relies upon later features in th (~ speed trace to determine which of the possible routes was correct. At the ends of paths lil c.r \ are simply too few features to make this distinction. At the beginning of paths this may simply cause there to be too many possible paths to sort through. These prob-lems are exacerbated in residential areas, where repeated, similar intersections are common.

Each convolution in the GRU-RCNhaszero-padded3×3 convolutions that preserves the spatial dimension of the inputs. The number of channels of each respective GR U-RN N hidden-representations are 64,128,256,256,512. After the RCN operation we obtain 5 hidden-representations for each time step. We apply average pooling on the hidden-representations of the last time-step to reduce their spatial dimension to 1×1, and feed the representations to 5 classifiers, composed by a linear layer with a soft mn x nonlinear y. Each classifier therefore focuses on only 1 hidden-representation extracted from the convolutional map of a specific layer. The classifier outputs are then averaged to get the final decision. A drop out ratio of 0.7 is applied on the input of each classifiers.

The TEM images taken as part of this study have strikingly confirmed previous hypotheses about the structure of heterostructures and multilayers grown with the ALL-M BE technique. In particular, the TEM images demonstrate that single layers of 2212end~201 can be grown as part of a multilayer. Furthermore, single layers of metastable or unstable phases such as 2278and1278 can also be grown. These TEM micrographs provide the first direct evi.den cc for the existence of? tdh osc phases. While growth flaws like twins, stacking faults and antiphase boundaries do occur, especially in overgrowth son metastable barrier layers, the images are most notable for the long, unbroken continuity of most 2212 planes. Up to this point, ALL-M BE growth of BiS rCa CuO superconductors have not reached the perfection that is observed in MBE growth of GaAs, AlAs and related compounds. However, planned improvements in the ALL-M BE process such as rotation of the substrate during growth may make comparably low defect densities possible.

Optical lattices are periodic potentials for atoms cre-ated by the interference of two or more laser fields. In near-resonant opti-cal lattices a set of laser fields produce at once the periodic potential for the atoms and the cooling mechanism, named Sisyphus cooling, which decreases their kinetic energy so that they are finally trapped at the bottom of the potential wells. We describe here the principles of these optical lattices in the case of a one-dimensional configuration and aJg=1/2→Je=3/2 atomic transition. This is the simplest configuration in which Sisyphus cooling takes place.

The present paper reviews and extends the existing work on Newtonian covariant hydrodynamics on the one hand, while on the other it applies the covariant techniques to magnetohydrodynamic-s ludie8?. Exploiting the advantages of the relative-motion treatment, we supplement the standard hydrodynamic formulae with a set of three propagation and three constraint equations that monitor the evolution of the irreducible kinematical variables. The latter, namely the volume expansion / contraction, the shear and the vorticity, describe the relative motion of neighbouring flowlines. The aforementioned formulae are obtained in a manner analogous to that of their relativistic uuntmDIFFNUMxatsdandth in--fo cill tale ~ i.'s, the direct compar-ison of the two sets.

Common W LCG storage technologies such as DPM and CASTOR at-tempt to decentralise some operations, locating metadata in a central database and distributing data across multiple file servers. Data access is lo-calised to the file-server to the extent that T URLs provided by SRM access are usually explicit references to services running on the file server with the file, not the central m?anagemen\t mache. The global state of anSE is still explicitly synchronised via the central bottleneck, however, as all lookups and handoffs must pass through it. Many experiments have ex-plored caching T URLs for individual files in order to optimise their performance, thus attempting to achieve object-store-like mechanics by the backdoor.

Each rectangular grid patch covers the region of space in its parent grid needing higher resolution, and may itself become the parent grid to an even higher resolution child grid. Initial and boundary conditions are obtained by interpolation from the parent grid when the cht id grid is creat-ed.

New NA60 results obtained in p-A collisions at158and400GeV have been presented and compared with the already existing measurements from other fixed target experiments. Cold nuclear matter effects, determined from p-A interactions, exhibit a rather strong energy and kinematical dependence. Therefore the use of the new p-A results at158AGeV, the same energy as the A-A data, allows a more precise definition of the expected cold nuclear matter effects in nuclear collisions. Apart from very central Pb-P b collisions, where the anomalous suppression is still sizeable, a smaller effect with respect to previous estimates is observed. Results on J / ψpolar and azimuthal parameters have also bee\n presented for both p-A and A-A collisions.

3.3.2. Impact on disk fragmentation. Stellar irradiation is known to have a profound impact on the gravitational stability of protostellar disks (Stam at ellos and Whitworth, 2009ab;Offneretal.,2009,Rice etal.,2011).Flareddisks can intercept a not abl?: fraction of the stellar UV and X-ray flux, which first heats dust and then gas via col lIons with dust grains. The net effect is an increase in he gas / d'~st temperature leading to disk stabilization. X-rays can also ionize gas. SPH simulations by Stamatellosetal.,(2011,2012) demonstrate that quiescent periods between the luminosity bursts can be sufficiently long for the disk to cool and fragment. Thus, episodic accretion can enable the formation of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary-mass objects by disk fragmentation, as confirmed l>y the recent numerical hydrodynamical simu-lations presented by Vorobyov,(2013).

Our results are given in Tables 5and6.Table5 gives. break-down of the quark-exchange processes into individual contributions. Table 6sums the results up to the charge radius. The difference in the predictions for models A andB shows that the short-ranged nonlocal attraction due to Figs.2(b-c)and2(e-g) indeed leads os or a educ redistribution of matter towards shorter distances which affects already the deuteron mat-ter radius and therefore the impulse approximation to the charge radius. We fia that the novel quark-exchange current contributions to the deuteron charge radius amount to about 20 % of the traditional π-meson exchange contribution; they are therefore of the same size as the non-p ionic exchange current corrections considered in Subsect.3.1.Thee.m.QEC corrections are, however, smaller than the quark exchange effects generating the attractive nonlocality responsible for the redistribution of matter to smaller distances.

One of the main differences to the standard model is that we do not assume an in-ner gap which accelerates particles to ultra relativistic energies and is saturated by a pair avalanche. Instead we suggest a conducting wire model with a quasi-stationary, low relativistic current that suffers fluctu-ations on short time scales. Such a model is supported by calculations on parti-cle densities available from the polar cap by thermal and field emission (Jessneretal.2001) which show that inner gap models have severe difficulties in producing parti-cles energetic enough to start pair cascades for parallel or nearly parallel rotators.

The signatures of strong electroweak symmetry breaking sector discussed so far are WW scattering and are relatively model-independent. There are signatures relevant at lower energies, though more model-dependent. Since our aim is to sort out the correct model which describes the electroweak symmetry breaking, such model-dependence is of great interest. Now we turn our discussions to the model-dependent signatures.

In Sec-tion II we consider the ba-sic elements of the Einstein-aether theory supplemented by the pseudoscalar field, and describe the background state possessing the pp-wave symmetry. In Section III we extend the model by adding the test electromagnetic field to the background field. In Section IV we obtain exact solutions for the electric, magnetic and pseudoscalar field. In Section V we discuss the anomalies in the electromagnetic response of the system on the action of the gravitational-pseudoscalar pp-waves. Conclusions are presented in Section VI.

1. Introduction
In order to show quark confinement, the condensation of a topological soliton is necessary to occur. This has been actually derived by summing up the $ l)evel () a \ it. soliton contributions, provided that the topological soliton is described by the topological field-theory. The topological field theory has been derived from the gauge fixing term corresponding to the nonlinear gauge fixing condition, the maximal Abelian gauge. The maximal Abelian gauge implies that the topological soliton in question is nothing but the magnetic monopole current, the four-dimensional version of the magnetic monopole. The result ensures that the quark confinement is realized in the QCD vacuum as a dual superconductor. Furthermore, we have proposed a numerical simulation which is able to confirm the validity of the above reformulation.

At model 1300,two unstable monotonic secular modes were encountered. As the core dominance of the nuclear burning ceased, the strength of the instability diminished. Eventually, the most unstable secular modes merged with other branches into oscillatory modes. Most of them became or remained stable during the early helium shell-burning phase. A discussion of the secular-stability behavior during the core He-burning phase of intermediate-mass stars is postponed to a forthcoming paper.

Enumeration
In the lead-ing order approximation of pQCD, only one Pomeron (dipole) splitting into two Pomeron s (dipoles), and two Pomeron s (dipoles) merging into one Pomeron (dipole) are considered. All other Pomeron vertices do not appear in the lead-ing log x approximation of pQCD. We therefore restrict ourselves to sum only Pomeron diagrams containing triple Pomeron vertices. We add a caveat, that we neglect the 4IP term (which is needed for s channel unitarity), however, this term is only significant at energies W>105, which is at the limit of the validity of our model.
In order to fit the experimental measurements, we consider the ratios:

Fully inclusive scattering likeD IS measures single parton dis-tributions, with no constraint on the size of the Fock state to which they belong. In exclusive scattering the whole Fock state is required to be compact. There are also intermediate (semi-inclusive) hard processes where the scattering occurs off multipart on subsystems of the hadron, such as qq, gg, etc. The theoretical framework for such pro-cesses is still incomplete, but the factorization of hard and soft physics seems plausible. This would allow experimental measurements of the compact subsystems Ond of the momentum fraction that they carry.

The choice of appropriate constituent masses also requires some care. Current quark masses would only be appropriate in a fully perturbative analysis in which classes of diagrams are re-summed to avoid singularities associated with particles going on shell. However, traditional constituent masses are not entirely appropriate for this calculation either, as they are typically obtained from static processes, not a dynamical scattering such as photoproduction. The choice of mass param-eters, as seen below, lies somewhere in between these extremes.

One prediction of the model, however, does not seem to be verified here: originally, the model aimed to explain the higher specific ft\e qae n<'y of ellipticals compared with spiral galaxies. Taking into account the different mass toV luminosity along the Hubble sequence, the specific frequencies of ellipticals are higher by a factor two than inspiral s(Ashman&Zepf1992).If this excess of globular clusters had to be explained by formation during mergers and interactions alone, Ashman&Zepf(1992) expected the formation of as many new globular clusters as there were old ones.

In this method, as opposed to the folding method with a shelving state, only one-way coherent transfer is required, so conventional STIR AP can be used. Another attractive feature of this method is that only one circular light polarization is used, which simplifies the implementation and also avoids the possibil-ity for atoms to be trapped in excited-state dark states, so the STIR AP fields can be tuned on one-photon resonance.

The third limi at iou is due to the key data structure of the learning switch application: the hash table. Existing controllers experience either a locking overhead or a large cache overhead, which in-creases the time needed to process each individual packet. We observed that NOX, Maestro and Floodlight experienced over 20%of cache misses in accessing the hash table data structure. All three allow packets to be processed out of order and this requires locking. Unfortunately, locks add significant overhead as the number of threads increases.

An invariant amplitude for scattering or dee ay in which the photon couples to the vector meson contains the ratio gVa b/g V which forces the appearance of the same ratio (squared) in the cross section or decay rate. We will discuss two methods for fixing these quantities. For the case of the φ(1020) we can fix these coupling constant s independently via strong and electromagnetic decays; whereas for the higher excitations presently considered we are forced to use another procedure. First consider the decay φ→ρπ.We calculate its rate to be

In this letter, we propose a unified model of DEan dDM in the context of a cosmic phase transition and further the mech-anism for the early forma-tion of non-linear objects.: I' he key feature of DE would be the volume-independent negative pressure, which guarantees the accelerated cosmic expansion through the Einstein equa-tion. The only known matter which shows negative pressure would be some classical coherent objects such as scalar fields. As an origin of such coherent object, we specifically consider the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a boson field with attractive interaction, and we can identify the condensation as DE and the exited bose gas asDM. The pressure of BEC for ideal gas is volume independent and therefore an intro-duction of attractive interaction would easily yields negative pressure. If we adopt this scenario, the DE dominance means that our universe is in almost the ground state described by a macroscopic wave function. Thus the largest scale of the Universe, as well as the smallest, would turn out to be de-scribed by quantum mechanics.

We must assume that they have interacted in such a way as to impart on one another a very weak rotation. By conserva-tion of baryon number we know one will have a rotation corresponding to positive baryon asymmetry and the other will carry negative baryon asymme-try. We now wish to show that this weak rotation is enough to cause the positive perturbation to preferentially accrete baryons as it grows, while the negative perturbation will preferentially accrete anti-baryons. Thus the charge asymmetries will be enhanced, eventually yielding a Q-ball / anti-Q-ball pair.
The procedure is to generate samples with Nu Wro generator for both experiments and compare the resulting ratio of Monte Carlo cross sections to the experimental one.

It appears then that an accelerator that is similar to the Energy Doubler could be made to be energy productive. Starting from the beginning, perhaps the injector system could be made to use lesser t ergy and produce higher intensities. Onetiti5onifld \ also optimize the size of the rings so as to reduce the refrigeration requirement and to raise the intensity capability. An important improvement (and one assumed in all the above) would be to make at least two magnet-rings back-to-back so that the electric energy could oscillate \ [rgm oAe t.o the other rather than just being put back into the power mains. This would double the intensity and would make efficient use of the injection system, for one ring could be loaded while the other was accelerating the protons previously loaded into it. My guess is that the optimum energy of the accelerator will be smaller, but this will depend on details of the injection system and on the shape of the real estate that is available. Values of N0 for other energies are given in Table I: they vary roughly inversely with the energy but100GeV gives fractionally about 30 % more energy per proton than does 1000GeV.

Overall our results are rather disappointing from a viewpoint of experimental searches for spin-exotic ~ (} -) ybm rds "mesons. We have evaluated two decay channels which combine to give a total width of over 400MeV. This will make the detailed experimental study of the hybrid meson relatively difficult. There are detailed predictions (such as that the πb1 mode will be dominant) that can be checked, however.
If we understand the amplitudes Z(λ)as result of a relativistic path in-tegral calculation, virtual paths characterized by λ=(λI,λII) are contained in the past light cones of events corresponding to λIand λII, and in the shared past region of both there will be contribu-tions of interaction terms in the action integral. This is the origin of correlation. After both subsystems separate, do not interact, the additional contributions along each individual path will not modify the established correlation, although obviously thy can generate individual evolution of each subsystem. That is, all correlation information in Z (λ)has a causal origin in the path integral formalism.

The Qut r it Case
Asin Paper I, we assume a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk (Novikov & Thorne 1973;-'?akure&Sunyaev1973), which now may be tilted with respect to the equatorial plane of a spinning BH. Furthermore, we assume that in the high lumi o sity state (i.e., not the advection dominated state; e.g.,Narayan&Yi1995) the inner disk edge extends to the last icatsht~-b1nne..kber bit. Of course, with a central X-ray source, radiation 0~res sure may have effects on the inner disk structure. We will delay the discussion of such effects until the next section.
Our second example concerns the relation between NM and a probabilistic version of NM, which can be constructed ac-cording to the following well-known recipe. We consider a phase space probability density ρ(x,p,t) and assume that the total differential of ρvanishes:
It is convenient to write the differential in an invariant way.

Our new model for SN feedback in SPH cosmological simulations has been divided into two stages: chemical and energy feedback. In this work we ad mdx ess the description of the chemical feedback, which is based on the previous model of Mosconietal.(2001). In a forthcoming paper, we will present the second part of this work: the implementation of energy feedback in the framework of a multiphase scheme for theISM, which extends the approach of Marri&White(2003). While a treatment of chemical enrichment with outer ergy feedback is an incomplete picture, we think the complexity of the problem merits a step-wise discussion of our model such that the primary physical effects can be better understood.

The effect of anti kaons in the pressure term is through the meson fields, which change due to the presence of additional anti kaon source terms in the equations of motion sinEqs.(11)-(15). In the absence of those source terms for anti kaons, we retain the equations of motion for meson fields in the pure hadronic phase.
Finally we introduce one more limiting operator:

2. The diffusion coefficient of convective / overshoot mixing shows different behaviors in convection zone and in overshoot region. In the convection zone, the characteristic length scale of the mixing is large, thus the diffusion coefficient is high enough to ensure that the convection zone is completely mixed in most cases. However, in the overshoot region, the characteristic length scale of the mixing is much shorter than in the case of convection zone, thus the diffusion coefficient is much lower. The overshoot mixing should be regarded as a weak mixing process.

As is well known, a background antiferromagnetic ordering does not ensure the minimum en-ergy of charge carriers. That is why the charge carriers tend to destroy the antiferromagnetic ordering and replace it by another ordering or by a disordered state, at lea in their vicinity. The destruction can be either static or dynamic (we neglect the trans-lational motion offer rons or magnetic strings discussed below, as their bandwidths are very small a.nd the Anderson localization should take place in real crystals).

The second ingredient in determining the absolute iron line emission is the ~ e ometry of the illumination (B asko1978;George&Fabian1991). Consider normally incident pho-tons with energy E>E th. On average, such photons traverse a distance corresponding to unity opt l c'*ahone m depth prior to being photo electrically absorbed. The resulting iron fluOr e#(:ells c photons have to travel through at least the same optical depth of material lnb rder to escape the slab. Some frac-tion of these iron line photons will be absorbed in this process (either by K-shell photoionization of low-Z metals or L-shell photoionization of iron). Now, consider photons that are incident on the slab with a large inclination (i.e. grazing collision). Again, these photons are absorbed after a unity optical depth, but this now corresponds to a significantly smaller vertical depth in the slab. Thus, the resultant iron line photons can escape significantly less impeded by subsequent absorption. The net result is that the effective fluorescent yield increases with increasing inclination(s eeFig.1ofGeorge&Fabian1991).

If Alice is inside a gravitational potential well and Bob is outside, the signals from Alice to Bob suffer a redshift (α<1). Signals from Bob to Alice are blue-shifted (α>1). Here, Alice ages more slowly than Bob and CBA > CAB.

A fairly bright (mBo = 14.26)spiralgalaxy(UGC12237) is present inside the ASCA error cir-cle: this is the most probable optical counterpart of AXJ2254+1146. Subsequent optical spectroscopy has confirmed that UGC 12237isaSeyfert2atz=0.029.
The concept of scale time is perhaps best visualised by considering the Univers éto have the topology of a Euclidean 3-sp here, in which spatial position is defined in the usual way by three angles in spherical polar coordinates, and time corresponds to the radius of the sphere. In this model, the concepts of l)~i/t.. present and future do not have any real meaning. Time is merely a coordinate that determines the volume of spacetime currently occupied by a par-ticle or field. This is in contrast to the conventional concept of space-time embodied in a Lorentz-de Sitter metric, in which time is perceived to flow from a well defined origin in the past towards an infinite future. Scale time, as defined here, is essentially similar to the concept of imaginary time used in some descriptions of Quantum Gravity.

We have shown that the inclusion of randomness permits a natural generalization of the Emc h-Rad in model to the class l2of square-summable lattice potentials. The generalized model (as well as the original one, of course) provides one of the very few examples of a random quantum system allowing a rigorous analysis of the dynamics of approach to equilibrium, and, in particular, of the role probability distributions play there.
Now we can discuss the formation of the wall in the realistic field theories, e.g., the electroweak (EW) theory or the grand unified theory (GUT). In the EW theory the heavy particles which contribute to create the wall are the top quarks, the weakbosonsZ0,W ± and the Higgs bosons. Approximately we have the wall-formation-constant for the EWw all:

An-d reonetal.(1997) have made a detailed compari-son of the properties of galaxies in the nearby Coma cluster and the distant cluster, Cl0939+47. They found that the spiral population of these two clusters appears too different in spatial, color and surface brightness distributions to be the same galaxy population observed at two different epochs. The Coma cluster is therefore unlikely to be representative of the end of the evolution path of Cl0939+47.

Due to its engineered photonic band structure, such a cavity array, coupled to quasi-spin wave excitations, can result in much richer quantum coherent phenomena. We show that the quasi-spin waves of charge qubits can control l ably affect the engineered photonic band structure so that the modified dis-persion relation results in a slow (and even zero) group velocity of photons propagating along \ the waveguide of coupled line resonators. The spin-wave excitation can also drive a coherent state of photons intlmcol/ledleistso,nnt waveguide. Some pumping methods can make a population inversion to produce a laser-like output above the threshold.

In order to study top quark properties such as the top quark polarization, induced from the effective t-b-W couplings, we need to reconstruct the top quark by combining the reconstructed W boson with the b-tagged jet. Most of the t-channels i~le top quark events contain only one b-jet in the final state. Thus, we can use th spec e ~ leading b-tagged jet algorithm to identify the b-j et in the final state, rather than the best-jet algorithm which is more appropriate for the s-channel. We found that the leading b-tagged jet algorithm effectively picks up the correct b-jet in the event. Since this algorithm makes no assumptions about the other particles in the event, we can use it to also determine the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino (pνz) accurately through a top quark mass constraint. Information about the reconstructed final state can be used to explore correlations between different objects in the event. After reconstruction of the top quark event, we study spin correlations in the top quark decay in three different bases: the helicity basis, the spec td to l' bass s,and the beamline basis. We find that the degree of top polarization is very large, especially in the helicity and spectator bases. This is true even after event reconstruction because we are able to reconstruct the top quark final state' al\mos l, perfectly. As one expects, the degree of top polarization is reduced slightly by the O(αs) corrections, both at parton level and after event reconstruction with the loose selection cuts. We also note that using the tq-frame (the rest frame of the reconstructed top quark and spectator jet) in the helicity basis gives almost the same deg iee of polarization as in the spectator basis.

Introduction
We also study the causality and stability for a state with nonzero background flow velocity, i.e., in a Lorentz-boosted frame. We find that the divergence of the group velocity is removed. However, depending on the boost velocity the group velocity of a ~. th cln the shear or the sound mode may still exceed the speed of light in a certain range of wavenumbers. Nevertheless, provided that the ratioτπ/Γs fulfills the asymptotic causality condition, we can show that the equations axes table. In contrast to the analysis in the rest frame, however, they become unstable if the asymptotic causality condition is violated. We shall demonstrate that if the asymptotic causality condition is fulfilled, the causality of the theory as a whole is not compromised. In this sense, causality and stability are intimately related.

The SDSS photometry becomes inaccurate due to \ snt we ction? for very bright point sources (i<14mag). Also, as we go to the brighter magnitude, the ratio of bright stars versus quasars satisfying the color selection criteria increases dramatically. As a consequence, the probability of a candidate being a quasar drops rapidly toward the brighter magnitude. Hence, we discarded candidates brighter than i=i?4,mag. Through these processes, we selected about a hundred additional candidates for observation in 2005 January. We name these additional candidates group B candidates. Figure 1 shows the color boxes of group B candidates, W D,WD+M pairs, and the stella locus. Note that the photometric data used in Figure 1 is not corrected for Galactic extinction as in Table 1.

In conclusion, we have shown that a simple form of embedded many-body expansion truncated at2 - body level gives an effective and accurate way of computing the MP2correlatione?ergl of large water clusters and ice structures with rather modest computational resources. Our calculations on three kEy ice structures show that MP2 gives a rather accurate account of their cohe-sive energies and their relative energies. However, the success of MP2forice structures is partly due to error cancellation, and a full understanding of their relative energies requires non-additive dispersion as described by CCS D(T). The application of the embedding techniques to a range of other condensed-phase molecular systems appears likely to be both feasible and fruitful.

They form the basis for our understanding of many phenomena, such as asymptotic freedom and gauge invariance. Therefore, we should strive to refine our handling of Feynman diagrams and to extend its context and its applications.

These nuclear structure effects could change the asymmetry Aby as much as ten percent. This uncertainty is so large that a quasielastic measurement may not provide useful information on strange quark contribu-tions or radiative corrections (unless these effects can be significantly constrained by future work). We note that a quasielastic measurement from deuterium rather than from a heavier nucleus should not be plagued by these uncertainties. We expect relativistic corrections to be much smaller for deuterium.

We study the holographic dual of asymmetrically warped space-times, which are asymptotically AdS. The self-tuning of the cosmological constant is re interpreted as a cancellation of the visible sector stress-energy tensor by the contribution of a hidden CFT, charged under a spontaneously broken global symmetry. The apparent violation of 4D causality due to bulk geodesics is justified by considering that the CFT feels the background metric as smeared out over a length of the order of the AdS radius.

Introduction
This expression shows that ultra-cold scattering physics is closely related to bound state physics just below the dissociation threshold. However, this simple relationship rapidly breaks down when going further away from resonance, and is therefore not sufficient to interpret three-body recombination in terms of the scatter-ing length.

The principle of finiteness of information is also a matter of controversy. Indeed, how can one verify that a quantum system must essentially have a finite information content? Many people may still be interested to know why we should have such a constraint about the possible measurement results. As many people, for example, are still curious to know why the thermodynamic systems inherently tend to go towards most proba-ble states according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Since, one may someday discover a? thermodynamic force which will explain the underlying reason of this tendency.

Instead, Ogreanetal.(2014) report that multiple density discontinuities are present den, other regions both on and off the hypothesized merger axis, speculating that the X-ray shock features arise, if real, from violent relaxation of the dark matter cores of the clusters.

In conclusion we would like to stress that we have constructed a model relaxing the requirement of Hermit i city of the Hamiltonian of the theory which is equiv-alent to the reality of the classical Lagrangian. This relaxation, however, does not imply the breakdown of Lorentz and CPT invariance. For our classical solutions, expressed in terms of real fields, observable quantities like energy density, pressure, Hubble variable turn out to be real. As a consequence our model describes in a rather natural way the transition from normal matter to phantom one.

At least some ellipticals are suppo scd to have formed by mergers or interactions. When the majority of these events happened is still unclear, as well as the evolutionary state of the progenitors (still gaseous proto-galaxies or evolved stellar systems?, seee.g.White(1994) for a review).

For each of the three search condition types, we further consider three types of top-k queries, where k=10,50,and1,000. The performance of the master CPUs, master memory bus, and network hub s~ep? end only on the k value while the perfor-mance of the components in slaves depends on both the search condition type and the k value.

In this section we describe briefly the coexisting-phases (CP) method to study the non-homogeneous phase of nuclear matter with a fixed proton fraction. The basic idea is ti it ~ ntt tè\[-?eat ~? be organized into separate drg i ebx of higher an ~ lower density, and the geometry of these regions is assumed to be very simple: a lattice of spheri-cal droplets (bubbles), a plan of cylindrical rods (tubes) or an alternating sequence of slabs. The interface between ~ vg ions is sharp, and it is taken into account by a surface term and a Coulomb one in the energy densi-ty. In the spirit of this approach, a single geometry will be the phys-ical one for some given conditions (temperature, den-sity and proton fraction).
Validity criteria for the linear approximation

The notion of material point is a basic tool in Mathematical Physics since the times of Euler, who introduced it. Even if material points (probably) do not exist, nevertheless they are very useful in the description of nature and they simplify the models so that they can be treated by mathematical tools. However, as new notions entered in Physics (such as the notion of field), the use of material points led to situations which required new mathematics. For example, in order to describe the electric field generated by a charged point we need the notion of Dirac? measure δq, namely this field satisfies the following equation:

Numerical solutions to partial differential equations always require discretization of the problem. This means that instead of continuous space and time dimensions we consider a discrete set of points. The compu-tational domain is subdivided into individual volume elements surrounding node points on a grid or unstructured mesh. Finite volume methods are pro-cedures for representing and evaluating partial differential equations as algebraic equations. They play akeyr6le in computational fluid dynamics. Similar to finite difference schemes, values are calculated at discrete places on a meshed geometry. Vol-um (', integrals that con-tain a divergence term are converted to surface integrals, using the divergence theorem. These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each volume element. Because the flux en-tering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods are conservative. Finite volume methods have been in the focus of applied mathematics for decades. They have well defined convergence properties and available code package shaver cached a very high degree of maturity and reliability.

The other point of view is that the cutoff is a mathematical means to an end, which is a limiting theory with the cutoff removed. At the intermediate stage a violation of energy-pressure balance may be tolerated, so long as the final the oi' y is physically acceptable. As you both remarked, an unphysical regularization can necessitate unphysical counterterms, so that the undesirable terms appear in the final equa-tions with coefficient 0(i.e.,notatall).I could live with that, but it is certainly highly un aesthetic.

What would happen if we change our assumption on the cosmological principle? This fundamentally important problem has not been pursued much, due to the mathematical difficulty in h~n dll r~g nonlinear processes. Not having alternatives due to practical difficulties in research does not guarantee that the presently available explanation should be correct. Scientific cosmology has the Universe as an external reality to compare. If the Universe looks simple in the standard model, is ig due to its intrinsic nature or to our simplifying assumptions?

Physics is the empirical science concerned with the behaviour of inanimate matter. The t6im? empirical science refers to the fact that physics relies solely in the abil-ity to test claims about the world with an experiment. Nevertheless, physics is a word and therefore has different meanings depending the use of it in different contexts. For example, we can also describe physics to be what physicist do. Before getting into a loop and describe a physicist as someone who does physics, we can define a physicist as those members of society which work in physics departments and receive funding to do physics. In this context, physics is defined as anything this group of people do. These two meanings are interwoven but l hey-are not equivalent. Our first definition describes an activity, the second one describes an activity done by certain people.

InSK14 we have argued that, as long as the initial time i chosen to be early enough, the choice of the value of fn that the initial time does not affect the final value off nth. In the inner region of the cluster, this is because the short turbulence dissipation time drives f nth quickly to its limiting value determined by the ratio of td and the cluster mass growth time-scale(s eeSect.3.2ofSK14).Intile, cluster outskirts, the turbulence pressure does accumulate throughout time, but the growth is significant after the region enters the virial radius of the clust?er pa hich oc-curs only at late times.

For the fully centralized structure, the performance of C-RANs is clearly constrained by the fron-t haul link capacity. In the uplink, for instance, R RHs need to sample, quantize, and then forward the received RF signals to the BBU pool. With densely deployed R RHs, the front haul traffic generated from a single UE with several MHz bandwidth could be easily scaled up to multiple gigabits per second (Gbps). In practice, a commercial fiberlink with tens of GHz capacity could thus be easily overwhelmed even under moderate mo bite traffic. One approach to this problem is to utilize the partially centralization structure though substantial signal processing capabilities are required on R RHs; the other alter-native is to adopt advanced techniques to optimize the performance under a fully centralized structure with constrained front haul. To simplify functions and capabilities of R RHs, the latter so-lution is the focus of this article, and the corresponding key techniques are surveyed.

String theory models are our only rigorously established models of quantum gravity, but none of the known models apply to the real world. They do not in-corporate cosmology, and they do not explain the break-ing of supersymmetry (SUSY) that we observe.

Its basic premise is a strong form of the holographic principle, formulated by myself and W. Fischler:

It is worth noticing that all the above models such as dark energy, f(R) - gravity and f(T) - gravity have shown to be, in broad sense, in agreement with observational data. As a consequence, unless higher precision probes of the expansion rate and the growth of nsr ut+l; ai'o will be available, these ri-val approaches could not be discriminated. This degeneration about the theoretical back-ground suggests that a more conservative approach to the prob-lem of cosmic acceleration, relying on as less model dependent quantities as possi-ble, is welcome.

The use of these features significantly reduces (; \] w+;6? computation time required when compared to the traditional way of using model checkers.

Of course, we should remind ourselves that, in our ordinary-matter world, those quarks can aggregate in no time, to hadrons, including nuclei, and the electrons serve to neutralize the charges also in no time. Then atoms, molecules, complex molecules, and soon. Th-ese serve as the seeds for the clusters, and then stars, and then galaxies, may be in a time span of 1Gyr(i.e., the age of our young Universe). The aggregation caused by strong and electromagnetic forces is fast enough to help giving rise to galaxies in a time span of 1Gyr. On the other hand, the seeded clusterings might proceed with abundance ol' extra-heavy dark-matter particles such as famil ons and family Higgs, all greater than a few TeV and with relatively long lifetimes (owing to very limited decay channels). So, further simulations on galactic formation and evolution may yield clues on our problem.

Meanwhile, if the cosmological principle is even approximately true, there must be a reason for the fact. Inflation provides a possibility that the re-gion within our present horizon has originated from inside the horizon before the early acceleration phase, thus opening a possibility that the cosmological principle can be ac\hiev;ed through a causal mechanism. However, inflation has not pro-vided the actual mechanism for that achievement. Although a class of homogeneous but anisotropic models is known to be driven to anisotropic model through acceleration, the gen-eral mechanism is not known yet. Why is the Universe spatially homogeneous and isotropic? This ma?y de-serve to be one of the important theoretical problems in scientific cosmology.

The angular clustering es-timate for these 724 sources is shown in the top left panel of Fig.4a, along with the two-parameter fit to this estimate. We see that the z<0.3 angular clustering signal is fairly low for the two-parameter fit, with a large uncertainty on the clustering amplitude (see Table 1): the dilution of any intrinsic clustering signal due to the long line-of-sight (of order 30 times the width of the light cone) is apparently too severe. If we fix the slope atδ=0.8(asshowninFig.4b),we find a more significant one-parameter fit for the amplitude, although the uncertainty is still considerable.

Using two complementary RGmethods,1: (, have provided a comprehensive study of the relaxation dynamics in the Ohmic SBM. The SBM is considered to be the prototype model for a microscopic description of dissipation in open quantum systems. We exploit the mapping of the SBM onto theIR LM. We have studied two basic protocols: a re-laxation protocol in which at time t=0 the system is prepared in a product state and the time evolution is performed with the SBM Hamiltonian as well as a quench protocol in which in addition at time tq)\0a parameter of the Hamilto-nian is abruptly changed. While the FRG was used earlier to study quenches in locally correlated quantum systems we here extended the RT RG to this type of nonequilibrium set up. A comparison of the results obtained us-ing our two approximate methods shows that both provide controlled access to the dynamics of the SBM close to the coherent-to-incoherent transition. In the limit of exponentially large times of the relaxation protocol a comparison to established results derived by other approaches is possible and further substantiates this. Crucially, we present new results for intermediate to long times providing npr u found \ understanding of the details of the relaxation dynamics in all time regimes of interest, in particular those relevant for discussing the crossover from coher-ent to incoherent behavior.
We can reconcile this apparent d?is-cr.e?p a ney by noting that the cause of the instability of Q-balls with a large energy per net baryon is quantum mechanical decay. Such decay is not treated in numerical simulations of the classical field. Thus, our estimates would lead us to conclude that unless some way of damping out the ellipticity of a partially-charged AD condensate is present, we must question whether such condensates will truly form Q-balls.

In our tests v;~*et assume the observations span approximately one com-plete solar activity cycle, and so we therefore use fitting models based on the co sinusoidal model. Aco sinusoidal variation is of course not an ideal match to the real observed time variation of the solar activity cycle; however, our point here is to test the principle of the technique. We begin with tests on artificial data that do have an underlying variation of the frequencies that is co sinusoidal in time. We then apply the technique to re allow-l time series, which have lengths spanning approximately one11-yr solar activity cycle.

We stress that all the comparisons lhtw(,Jd;cl)r?e?sont in this paper have been performed between EOB and Teukolsky waveforms produced with the same EOB trajectory. For example, in order to recalibrate the EOB model, we start with a reasonable EOB trajectory, we feed that to the Teukolsky code, and compare the resulting Teukolsky waveforms to the EQ Bt a?vc forms?. If the waveforms do not agree, we modify the EOB trajectory so that the EOB waveforms agree with the Teukolsky waveforms produced with the old EOB trajectory, and then feed the 6riqunevrEOB trajectory to the Teukolsky code. We then iterate until this procedure has converged.

Care-ful analysis revealed that 16 de-tected sources are known water masers. The H2Olinewaswithi the recorded bandwidth. We made a trial fringe search using only one frequency channel which included the water maser line. The fringe amplitude decreased by factor of 4 for continuum sources and increased by the same factor for maser sources.
On the other hand, interstellar travel does not necessarily require large accelerations. Small accelerations sustained over long periods of time suffice.
In case I,a=1,andifm>0,thenAx is positive. This implies that in order to keep the observer comoving with the wall it has to accelerate away from the symme-try plane or in other words it is attracted towards the wall. Similarly ifm<0, then the wall exhibit esa repulsive nature to the observer. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the domain wall solutions of case II(ii).

For many of these outflow features, we can not clearly identify a counterflow lobe. This is likely due to confusion of the more compact outflows in the central region. For this reason, in this paper we will focus on the properties of the un confused outflows as well as on the global outflow properties. Interferometry will be important for disentangling these compact outflows, identifying their driving sources, and provide a better estimate of their energetics.

Dark matter datataking was otherwise only interrupted by regular calibrations using blue LED light (for the PMT response), a137Cs source (for monitoring of the LXepurity),and60Coand232Th sources (for ER background calibration). Overall, the duty cycle of XENON100 during this dark matter runwas81 %.

One problem we had to face was t fat of gauge invariance. Unlike QED, where the charge renormalization was trivially gauge invariant (because the pho-ton is neutral), the renormalization constants in QCD were all gauge dependent. However the physics could not depend on the gauge. Another issue was the choice of regularization. Dimensional regularization had not really been developed yet, and we had to convince ourselves that the one-loop β-function was insensitive to. them regul ict rization used. We did the calculation in an arbitrary gauge. Since we knew that the answer had to be gauge in-variant, we could use gauge invariance as a check on our arithmetic. This was good since we both kept on making mistakes. In February the pace picked up, and we completed the calculation in a spurt of activity. At one point a sign error in one term convinced us that the theory was, as expected, non-asymptotically free. AsI sat down to put it all together and to write up our results, I caught the error. At almost the same time Politzer finished his calculation and we compared, through Sid-ney, our results. The agreement was satisfying.
We have thus improved the limit obtained by Ramberg and Snow by a factor about 40.
Introduction
After a decade of intensive study, our understanding of exclusive double charmonium production has gradually matured. The most notable lesson is perhaps that, the NRQCD factorization approach has proved to be a successful and indispensable to olinda liu with hard exclusive reactions involving heavy quarkonium. However, in our opinion, this research area is still far from being closed, and there remain some important questions to be answered. In the following, we enumerate two topics which may urgently beg for the exploration.
The basic CCD reductions (bias-subtraction, dark-correction, flat-fielding) were carried out within standard IRAFV2.12.2 routines. For all frames we have applied a point-spread-function fitting within theIR AFtaskDAOPHOT(Stetson1987). Photometry of each frame was performed separately and the measurements were then averaged and weighted by their indi-vidual photometric error.

Numerical modeling of type II critical collapse of relativistic fluids even in spherical symmetry is a rather challenging task.

Most of the modifications of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian involve a change in the geometric part of the action only, and assume that the matter Lagrangian plays a subordinate and passive role, which is implemented by the minimal coupling of matter to geometry. However, a general theoretical principle for bidding an arbitrary coupling between matter and geometry does not exist a priori. If theoretical models, in which matter is considered on an equal footing with geometry, are allowed, gravitational theories with many interesting d novel features can be constructed.

Abstract
After removing particles used in the B tag reconstruction, we require that an event have only one charged track, that its charge be opposite that of the B tag and that its laboratory-frame momentum exceed 1.0GeV/c. This charged track is required to satisfy | dz|<2.0cmanddr<0.5cm,where|dz | and dr are the distances of clos-est approach to the interaction point along and perpendicular to the beam axis.

Besides that, we consider generation of photon twl ~ s entangled with respect to the total angular momentum.

Closing remarks
Rapidly evolving genomic technologies are providing biologically informative data of un-precedented volume, velocity, and vari-ety, with the potential to yield new insights into the processes driving disease. This data has allowed us to develop a more unified understanding of how many different types of interactions at multiple and vastly different scales can influence biological systems. We now appreciate that changes in cellular states involve simultaneous alterations to the genome, epi geno I me transcriptome, metabo lome, and proteome of the cell. These are often characterized by complex networks whose structures are altered as the phenotype changes. The generation of Big Data in this area now presents an unprecedented opportunity to develop scalable methods capable of modeling these networks, informing us about the nature of disease and ultimately allowing us to hypothesize about the therapeutic approaches most appropriate for each disease state.

How does stellar evolution impact dynamical evolution? Stellar evolution and dynamical evolution can not be sep-arated from one another. Stellar evolution causes mass loss from a cluster which alters the mass and energy of the cluster. In responding to this clusters will expand, which will increase their crossing times, and hence their relaxation times.

We saw before that the basic problem with the naive approach to defining the language generated by a TLR grammar is that the derivation of the string on the symbol stack can be extended. In the last section, we defined the language generated by a TLR grammar using the valid semi parse relation. In this section, we will prove that requir-ing valid transformations prevents the extension of the string on the symbol stack. This is essential to provin dg that the TLR parsing algorithm, the subject of the next section, is correct.

The framework presented in this paper for sequential MCMC consists of two sampling stages, referred to as the joint draw and refinement step. However, the framework is flexible in the sense that both sampling stages sample from the target distributions nd are thus not both necessarily required for operation. The joint! (l Ir?~u:? has the advantage of only requiring a single evalu-ation of the measurements. The refinement step introduces additional computational complexity but has also shown to significantly increase the efficiency of the sampling in higher dimensional state space models. Once an appropriate architecture for the sequential MCMC is selected, there is additional flexibility which arises in the form of selection of the proposal distributions. A common choice for the joint draw is to utilise the following proposal distribution:

By the time the simulation reaches 200Myr(bluedot-dashedliae), star formation has depleted the gas, causing the surface density to drop by a factor of 2.0indIsk-FAFOhlyand1.5 for diskS F+PE heat. Since star formation occurs in the coldest and densest regions of the disk, the azimuthally averaged temperature rise sas do the corresponding values for the velocity dispersion and Q. The velocity dispersion also increases due to gravitational heating, as star particles are formed to create local deep po-tential wells. This effect is strongest in the disk without diffuse heating, since 500,000 more star particles have formed by this time, causing a greater depletion of the dense gas.

The invariance of the truth ot the relevant axioms under scaling is an important requirement.

Also the truth of equations in scaled analysis is preserved under mapping to the corresponding equations in unscaled analysis. Fer example, fer any analytic function, f, one has

Case without symmetry
However, due to the singularity of hatr=0, and the fact that the transverse dimensions are non-compact, any integration o very is likely to be divergent. Worse, each term in the action will generally pickup different powers of the function h such that the divergences can not even be gathered into a common divergence multiplying the entire action. This means that di w~r gence will proliferate in the equat iQ n nts of motion, and our effective theory will be poorly defined. As a first step toward rectifying this problem, we assume there is some region of moduli space in which powers of h are well approximated by a series-expansion to first order:
B (X,Y)=Y4+X4+6X3Y3+X3Y7+6X4Y4+X7Y3.

On the other hand, since April 2007 we are operating the phase II of the Tupi experiment, with two directional muon telescopes at sea level and located at 22Sand43W, inside the SAA region and close to its central area. This characteris-tic supplies to the muon telescopes the lowest rigidity of response to cosmic protons and ions(≥0.4GV). This value is approximately half of the rigidity of the pola c, regions. In addition, the SAA is like a hole in the magnetosphere and the IMF lines overtake the surface, in the day side, in this region. Conseguentl5y, the magnetic anomaly works like a funnel for incoming charged particles from space. The main effect of the SAA is an increase of the muon intensity at sea level in this region, in upto10 times in the day side.

Here we ask and answer, in the Bayesian MPE framework, the elementary question: What source brightness is needed to reduce the MPE below a given threshold for discriminating a single pair of closely spaced, equally bright point sources of a given separation from a single point source of the same brightness located at the midpoint of the line joining the pair? This defines a simpler problem of binary hypothesis tes l\ng within the Bayesian detection framework, avoiding a more involved problem in which the matter of such bi-nary discrimination is coupled with the additional requirement of estimating the spacing between the point-source pair. The minimum signal strengths needed for this single source vs. pair source discrimination, as we shall see, are rather modest and consistent with the growing experimental evidence for high-precision optical super resolution (OSR) of point sources.

On the other hand, the dynamics of each sub-domain might be defined in terms of the characteristic curves associated with the activity variable.

After giving our results on the γ-ray optical depth as a function of energy and redshift out to a redshift of 0.3,weappl your calculations by comparing our results with re-cent spectral data on Mrk421 as reported by McEnery,etal.(1997) and spectral dtaonMrk501 given by Aharonian, etal.(1997). The results presented here supercede those of our previous calculations (Stecker & DeJager1997), which were based more on theoretical models (see discussion inMS98). We consider the results presented here to be considerably more reliable than any presented previously.

The resonator and trap degree of freedom exchange quanta until they equilibrate to the same mean number of quanta, which is set by the background (e.g., thermal) number of photons in the microwave cavit ~. Note that while we describe here only cooling of the degree of freedom perpendicular to the ch lp surface, similar considerations can be applied to all trap degrees of freedom. Finally, we note that the trapping potentials experienced by the molecule in the upper and lower states may be different. However, side-band cooling can still occur in this regime and leads to similar cooling rates and final temperatures as described above.

Conventional particles can be the equiva-lent of phonons or soli-tons, as excitations of the super brady on ic ground state of matter (the vacuum) at the fundamental length scale. Their properties would then not be the ultimate fundamental properties of matter. Standard interactions may have been topologically generated in such a scenario. Also, our Universe may not be the only possible one. If different universes can also be formed, the pl+c p(,,r tib\s? of standard particles may be universe dependent.

In strong contrast, in typical numerical simulations of phantom systems, all polymers (or particles) are ascribed to lattice sites, and then cross-links are randomly introduced, connecting some neighboring particles. After removing the sol part, the system is allowed to relax at nonzero temperature, with intra-cluster repulsion completely ignored. This corresponds to a large positive value for B0buta vanishing value of B.As we shall soon see, it is this qualitative diffetencebetweenB0andB that is responsible for conductivity-like scaling of the shear modulus in phantom networks.

As formulated by Wilson, the lattice cutoff is remarkable in remaining true to many of the underlying conn épts of a-gauge theory. At the most simplistic level, a Yang-Mills theory is simply electrodynami:C / (cS embellished with isospin symmetry. By working directly with elements of the gauge group, this is inherent in lattice gauge theory from the start.
Studies of the Euler equations for free surface water waves are important to understanding the dynamics of ocean v aves. The case of an idealized flat bottom and the resulting model equations has been widely studied for many years. The more realistic situation of varying bathymetry is less well known, despite its fundamental importance to studies of ocean wave dynamics in coastal regions, and there is not a complete consensus as to the aPl)? ro pr\iate model equations. In the case of topography there are many asymptotic scaling regimes of interest, including long-wave of modulation al hypotheses for the evolution of the free sur-face, and short scale and / or long scale variations in the variable bottom fluid boundary.

Fago cm the above analysis, wE see that a net, topologi-cally nontrivial fundamental gap exists only at intermediate shell thickness. If the shell is too thin, then the effective gap is positive and the fundamental gap is topolog-ically trivial. On the other hand, if the shell is too thick, then although the effective gap turns negative, the electron-like band overlaps with too many valence bands, which causes the hybridization gap to be covered up. Thus, no fundamental bandgap would exist.
All the above parameters are set real and positive using U(1)R symmetry and an appropriate shift of the imaginary components of the moduli fields, while θrepresents the relative phase among the exponentials. We also assume the relation between the parameters in the exponents

Here we have considered the (n+2) - dimensional Husain space-time in presence of radiating null fluid, barotropic fluid, an electro-magnetic field and a scalar field with pote ial. The corresponding solutions have been obtained. Next we have analyzed the gravitational collapse of a star in Husain space-time. The existence of outgoing radial null geodesic has been thoroughly investigated in order leba natter Ize the nature of central singularity formed as the end state of collapse. Equation of radial null geodesic is formed and the values of the variable X0 is computed for different values of parameters in different dimensions. Surprisingly in all the cases it was found that irrespective of the values of the parameters chosen, the value of X0 is always positive and hence the singularity formed is always a naked singularity. This has been shown in a tabu-lar form. Impact of accretion phenomenon on the gravitational collapse of a star has also been taken into account. The mass function for a collapsing procedure is considered and from it, the equation of X0 is constructed for various dimensions. To study this case graphs were drawn for different va, ucs of the parameters (f0,g0,e0,E0) and it was found that the figures did not show any tendency of sneak-ing into the negative region. Hence black holes may not be the correct op-tion for Husain metric in any dimension. Formation of event horizons is totally barred in Husa i metric. So the only possibility is a naked singularity. Hence this is a significant counterexample of the cosmic censorship hypothesis.

In summary, using an rf-SQUID as a prototypical bistable system, we have demonstrated the existence of SR with sir iq le-cycle perturbation to the symmetric double-well potential of the system. Furthermore, we have investigated the possibility of exploiting SR for detecting small single-cycle and few-cycle signals in noisy environment. We have found that a proper amount of noise can lead to SR which enhances the sensitivity of detection. Our work provides insights into the behavior of bistable systems under the combined influence of weak single-cycle (or few-cycle) periodic modulation and n?oise w' Because conventional techniques, such as phase sensitive lock-in and heterodyne detection schemes, are not applicable to detecting single-cycle and few-cycle signals buried in noise, the method demonstrated here is promising for applications where signals are unavoidably mixed up with noise and only last a very small number of cycles.

In our analysis W' considered the situation when the scaling ansatz is obeyed exactly. We expect h#wetv~rthal.ollr result ~ remain qualitatively valid even for systems with small deviations from the exactly scalable Hamiltonians. For example, weak lattice potentials should not have dramatic effects as long as the effective mass approximation is applicable. Therefore one could achieve a full description of time-of-flight experiments if the lattice potential and interactions are tuned accordingly. Moreover it is conceivable that on a phenomenological level the ansatz can be used even when the time-and space-dependencies of system parameters do not fully satisfy the consistency equations. The scaling solution could then be seen as a universality class of non-equilibrium sys-tems, very much like a renormalization group fixed point at equilibrium. It would be interesting to address this conjecture in experiments.

Besides this, technical limitations (see IMAGES-I) have prevented us from measuring the kinematics of 3 starbursts, because their emission line region are too compact (seeFig.9).

While one can actually determine the matrix element itself on the lattice, B-parameters are obtained from ratios of corre-lation functions in which many statistical and systematic uncertainties are expected to cancel. Furthermore, the ma-trix element has mass dimension four and therefore suffers very strongly from the uncertainty associated with the determination of the lattice cut off which is of order 10%in present day quenched calculations. As we shall also see later, it is advantageous to get the matrix element from an independent determination of BBq and f Bq and the experimental value of MBq.

Dense knots of material which follow ballistic trajectories may also be expelled from the disk by super bubbles. Knots formed by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities as a super bubble breaks through the disk material and begins to accelerate into the halo follow ballistic trajectories away from the disk, as they have significantly higher column densities than the halo material (Cioffi1986). These knots of material may lead to relatively disconnected clouds of dense material in the low-halo of spiral galaxies. If dust survives in these fragments of the evolved super bubble, the ejected clouds may provide a source of halo dust grains. Greater knowledge of the degree to which dust can survive in the walls of super shells is needed to assess the role these structures may play in lifting dust beyond the thin disk of spirals.

Einstein realized, after the formulation of Special Relativity, that the mass can be reduced to a manifestation of energy and momentum. As a consequence, it is impossible to distinguish between an uniform acceleration and an external gravitational field, not only for free-falling particles, but whatever is the experiment. According to this observation, Einstein EP states:

An extensive study was made including 16 samples among published work on terahertz Q CLs from the last ten years, using our NEG F simulation scheme. Using identical simulation parameters, we find that the simulated current does not agree with experimental results for all samples. However, we observe a clear trend that these deviations are similar for samples form a given laboratory. This shows that samples from if\ferent laboratories are not fully comparable. We show that interface roughness alone can not account for these deviations in the simulated current under lasing compared to experimental data. Assuming different calibrations of doping density orAl content? in different laboratories could explain these trends. However more intricate issues, such as different barrier profiles, can not beer ute out.

Now it is straightforward to finish the analysis of the Poisson brackets of the constraints of the Lagrange multiplier modified grav-ity.

It is important to distinguish between these very different potential origins of the soft excess as l?h+'y make very different predictions about the environment and geometry of the accreting material close to the black hole. The extreme broad iron lines required in the pure reflection models are not required in the absorption models (either smeared: So bolewska&Done2007;Done2007 or partial covering: Miller etal.2008)as the broad feature r edwards of their online is fit instead by continuum curvature. All the absorption models require the presence of material above the inner dic, probably in the form of a wind, whereas the reflection models instead suggest a clean line of sight to the inner disc. The large velocity shear in the smeared wind model requires that the material is strongly accelerated, so it potentially carries an enormous amount of kinetic energy (Chevallier etal.2006;Schurch&Done2006) with c~rlefipdnntityi'ng impact on AGN feedback / galaxy formation.

By including the effect of local lattice distortions inCuO2 layers, a new kind of Hubbard model has been proposed, with two sites on the links of the lattice. By integrating out high frequency modes in strong coupling perturbation theory a lattice gauge magnet was obtained. The resulting theory confines or screens the spin of hole quasiparticles at the intersection points (copper atoms), resulting in pairing and superconductivity. Because of the role of oxygen nuclear motion, at least a weak oxygen isotope effect should result. There is an second charge condensate, corresponding to the Goldstone mode of the fractionally charged, spinning Higgs field.
They look almost the same except for the last terms. Now, considering one that comes from the real parts and rearranging the terms we get
This concludes the summary of our main results. In the next section we define the model and the method of calculation by which they have been obtained.

Several authors suggested that the bulk viscosity can dr Lw, ~ the universe into a period of exponential expansion (inflation) (Murphy, Grφn, Be esham, Arbab).

Inflation can also be induced by higher order corrections (Star obinsky,1980).In scalar field, ll':_l~lysnieo? stopped by the slow roll-down of the scalar field from the false vacuum to the true vacuum. In this work, we investigate the coupling of gravity with vac-uum and viscosity. Provided a certain conspiracy is maintained the evolution of the universe can proceed in an attractive way. We have found that such a recipe is possible and leads to interesting features related to the cosmic evo\lu ti ever. Inflation is triggered by the vacuum energy bulk viscosity cooperation. This work generalizes our recent model of phantom and dark energy mod-els (Arbab,2@07).

Molecular cooling is described in Paper I, but now in addition, we have included metal line radiative cooling in the optically thin limit. To simulate metals in our simulations, we define a generic mass snl arin FLASH, which is advected with any flows. For the cooling rates we use the tabulated results from Weirsmaetal(2008), which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, and in all cases we use standard solar abundance ratios. The radiative rates are defined over a large tem-perature range, from 102K~through109K. The specific cooling rate for a given tem-perature is found using a table lookup from a data file and scaling by the local metallicity.

The cutoff Coulomb approach is seen to produce accurately converged results for a single-shot calculation, regardless of the size of the simulation cell (as long as it is bigger than the extent of the nonzero density). The only requirement is that the original cell must, for the purposes of Fourier transform s, be embedded in a padded cell of suf-ficient size. This generally entails quite a large temporary memory requirement, af3 in small systems the performance of FFTs can become the limiting factor on the speed of the whole calculation. However, in large systems, where the Hartree calculation is generally not a significant part of the total computational effort, this is no longer an issue.

This is an extremely strong constraint which very much disfavors the natural solutions to the hierarchy prob-lem, and is independent of the arguments we gave in the previous section. This is widely recognized and thus there has been a major effort to search for generic ways out or at least loopholes to this bound. On the other hand, even if there are loopholes, the bound still might be generic. In the context of the string landscape, the correct attitude would then be to accept i las preferred, also allowing the vacua (and cosmological histories) which realize the loophole, but weighing them by appropriate tuning factors.

By solving analytically the master equation describing the evolution of the two qubits, we analyzed dynamics of the three GQ Ds, and found that they are incompatible in characterizing quantum correlations, although they are all well defined from a geometric perspective. Our fin clin fs are illustr cited through two distinct behaviors of the three GQ Ds. First, we found that the three GQ Ds may exhibit com-pletely different SCs for both the two-sided and the one-sided reservoirs. The critical times for the SCs and the times of SCs are strongly dependent on thc choice of the GQ D measure and the form of the initial state. Different GQ D measures have different SCs, and thus the SCs are in fact the combined result of the chosen GQ D measure and the quantum state, but not the int riu sic property of a state itself. This is fundamentally different from the sudden death of entanglement, which is independent of the entanglement measure. Moreover, we also revealed the relativity of different GQ Ds. To be explicit, we found that the thermal reservoir may lead to a generation of qual o-cn me states manifesting different orderings, and this implies that different GQ Ds are incomparable as their behaviors may not only be quantitatively but also be qualitatively different.

Renormalization
Introduction
One of the most important goals in surface science is to be able to control dynamical processes taking place at a surface. We have proposed substrate patterning as a means to control the relaxation dynamics of low-frequency frustrated-translational vibrations of an adsorbate overlayer. This proposal emerges from our recent work demonstrating that the dominant relaxation mechanism for these modes is resonant emission of phonons into the substrate. Specifically, we have considered short-period superlattices as candidate substrates, because the mass modulation of a superlattice causes gaps to open in the phonon density of states. Varying the super-lslttice?nmposltihavealio vs oe? to control the size and placement of these band gaps, thereby controll ably modifying the coupling between, the adsorbate overlayer and the substrate. We view the successful experimental demonstration of the behavior pre-dicted here as a stringent test of our theory of resonant adsorbate-substrate cou-pling. Moreover it would establish substrate pat l;ern i ligas an important tool in surface dynamical research.

At a proton-proton collider such as the LHC, the forward region is also a more sensitive probe of the forward-backward asymmetry in Z decays. Z bosons produced in the forward region are more likely to follow the initial quark direction and consequently suffer less from the dilution of the parton level asymmetry observed in the central region. This is discussed in more detail later in the text.

When we applied a laser pulse tuned to a wavelength of a metastable to short-lived transition, a sharp peak appeared in the AD ATS, the intensity (area) of which was proportional to the number of antiproton annihilations induced by the laser pulse. Spectral line profiles could then be obtained by plotting the peak intensity against the laser wavelength as this was scanned through the central transition wavelength.

Because a physical pion would feel the boundaries of the box in which we work and because the algorithms we use slow down rapidly for lighter quarks, we are restricted to work with quarks with masses on the order of ms/2 or more. Thus, to obtain results at the physical values of the u,d and s masses, we perform all calculations for three values of the light-quark mass roughly in the range ms/2→ms and extrapolate or interpolate to the physical mass values.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we derive the lateral shifts of TE and TM polarized light beams in transmission through the EO crystals, according to the stationary phase approach. In Sec. III, we discuss the electric control of the lateral shifts in the case of different crystal cuts. In the same section, an alternative way to realize the polarization beamsplitter is also proposed. In Sec. IV, numerical simulations for Gaussian-shaped beam are made to demonstrate the validity of above theoretical results given b?y stationary phase method. Finally, a conclusion will be given in Sec. V.
More generally, it would also be interesting to know what aspect of regularity is responsible for super frustration in arbitrary lattices.
Comparing Fig.2withFig.3,we see that the main difference between the clamped and un clamped case is that in the atomic layers with lateral composition modulation (layers 2and4), the hydrostatic strain (sum of all three diagonal strain com-ponents) is much smaller in the un clamped structure than in the clamped structure. This would lead to a major difference in the band-edge profile for the two structures to be discussed below.

Nevertheless, matter does affect the free energy. It is interesting to describe this effect entirely in the flux picture. The idea is to see what is happening to the fl mux configurations when one side of the effective potential for the lines is lowered. Lowering the free energy means increasing the partition function. I will show that this increase in Z comes from an increase in the number of allowed flux configurations in the presence of UG at-eri.e. an entropy increase.

In order to obtain a static RSA from a changing flip traversal, we use the notion of a trace. A trace is a domain on the βn×βn gri. It consists of edges and boxes: an edge is a line segment of length 1 whose endpoints have positive integer coordinates; a box is a square of side length 1 whose corners have positive integer coordinates. Similar to arbor esc ences, we require that a trace R(i)is (topologically) connected; (ii) contains the root (1,1);and(iii) from every gridpoint contained in R there exists an x-andy-monotone path. to the root that lies completely in R.

When the growth history is considered, via the alteration of δcin the ST mass functions, small, but not in significant, differences between the STand J01 predictions for the relative mass function in EDE and ΛCDM emerge. Future work with simulations containing sufficient volume to accurately probe the high mass range could discriminate between the two approaches to mass function fitting and determine whether t tie growth history affects halo abundances.

Therefore, as shown in the present paper, although the magnetic field freezing-in effect is universal (i.e., manifests itself in a similar way in media with isotropic and strongly anisotropic conductivities), the physical mechanisms responsible for it are absolutely different in these two limiting cases. In anisotropic plasma, freezing-in is due to induc-tion currents, which compensate the variation of the magnetic flux through a closed contour moving together with the conducting substance. In the case of a plasma with a strong anisotropy, freezing-in is a direct consequence of particularities of the electrodynamic drift which are associated wi i;h the divergence-free character of the magnetic field and the equipotential character of the field lines.

The relaxation time T relax is the time-scale on which the ei’suetsfftaur will lose all traces of its initial condition (Yadavetal.2013). Due to internal dynamics of the cluster, the contraction and destruction forces make the cluster approach a Maxwellian equilibri-um. Through this time, low mass stars may evaporate with large random veloci-ties trying to occupy a larger volume than the high mass stars do (Mathieu and Latham 1986).

As an. asymptotic free theory, it has successful applications in high energy region (i.e.,E>1GeV), but in low energy region (i.e.,E<1GeV), one can not make ordina ty perturbation calculations since, in this region, the coupling constant becomes large. To describe the physics of strong interaction in low en-ergy region, one may develop some effective theories which re-flect the symmetries and symmetry breaking in this enet gy region.

A part of the role of strange quark mass in general, there is also a general issue of correct connection of units and vacuum parameters (with the instant on density be-ing one of them) for QCD with different number of flavors?.

The STAR Heavy Flavor Tracker, with its ex-tremely precise and thin inner layers, is designed specifically to allow direct reconstruction, with low background, of charmed hadrons from their hadronic decay modes, from rather low pTupto10GeV/c. This allows one to investigate the chemistry of charm fragmentation, and search for its modification in heavy ion collisions, by reconstructing and comparing a number of different charmed hadrons from D0toΛc. For flow studies, total charm cross sections, and correlations, the loss of information through the undetected neutrino in semi-leptonic decays causes ambiguities. These ambiguities prevent precise measurements in the hydrodynamic regime of parent DpT below approximately 2GeV/c, and can complicate precise interpretation of suppression patterns at higher pT. Direct reconstruction of charmed hadrons using the Heavy Flavor Tracker removes these ambiguities.

On the other hand, recent observational work (Giovannini etal.1995) leads to the scenario in which jets of low-luminosity radio galaxies are relativistic on par-sec scales. This is consistent with unified models, where FRI radio galaxies form the parent population of BL Lac objects (Urry&Padovani1995).

No other phase transitions are detected below 5GPa. The phase diagram of solid oxygen therefore has been completely determined, deleting uncertain phase transition boundaries at low temperature. The sensitivity of the X-ray diffraction techn6nqLLe has been essen-tial to clarify the weakness of previous spectroscopic work, where phase transitions can be detected only by subtle kinks in the pressure slope of mode frequencies. In addition, the results of this work can furnish a precise recipe to be followed to avoid metastability and obtain a good annealing of an solid oxygen sample.
We have analyzed two-qubit gates in a pair of qubits, each encoded in to singlet and triplet states of a DQD, an cl coupled by Coulomb repulsion. A two-qubit C NO eT gate, which together with the single qubit rotations forms a universal set of quantum gates, can be performed by tuning the bias of the in-ner dots with respect to the outer ones. We identify the entan-gling interaction strength Ee as a quantity that has to be controlled in order to implement aC NOT with the aid of single qubit rotations.

The fact that clumps and their parental clouds shares iml lar mass spectral forms suggests a common formation mechanism. Thus clumps could be built up by the same type of agglomerative and gravitational instability process that produced molecular clouds. Turbulence has also been proposed as the origin of a wide range of structure and substructure (ElmegreenandEfremov1997).

mach capt lon to model spatially correlated noise arises naturally in the formalism through the spectral function Cjk (ω).It allows for a spatially decaying correlation function with a distinctive correlation length ξ,i.e. one can transition smoothly between infinite, finite and no spatial correlations.

The tracing of the peak intensity along the dispersion axis is done by searching for more maxima around the original location within a cer-tain window, specified by the user. This is an iterative process, starting in the original column, and continuing across the CCD. The result is a trace mask containing the central locations of each fibre, at each pixel in the dispersion direction. The user specifies the distance between adjacent maxima, and they must also account for the large gaps between the blocks of 50fibres.A visual inspection of the tra(:e mask superimposed on the dome flat is therefore often required to check that the in-put parameters are satisfactory, and that the gaps are being dealt with accordingly, as this can be difficult to implement automatically.

The gravitational radius in the Schwarzschild solution in D=4 is arbitrary, too. It is in fact possible to find a similar symmetry there. Although this arbitrariness and the existence of a corresponding symmetry in both di-mensions are closely related to the arbitrariness in choosing boundary conditions, there is a crucial difference in both dimensions: Thanks to the Weyl invariance of the matter coupling inD=2,thesymmetry(2)is exact at the classical level even in the presence of the matter. That is, the matter does not feel the gravity mediated by the Weyl degree of freedom at the classi-cal level, unless the matter coupling violates the Weyl invariance. (A test particle, for instance, would feel the black hole because its coupling violates the symmetry (2).)

We nb mr rew the ideas above and apply them to the context of nonequilibrium dynamics. The total Hamiltonian dictating the dynamics of the system is written in a basis that incorporates the initial state as one of its vectors. The width of the energy distribution of the initial state corresponds to the width of what we call, here, the energy shell. The lifetime of the initial state depends on how large this width is and on the filling of the sil ell.As we show, when the width of the energy shell is small com-pared to the width of the density of states and when it is not well filled, which happens for initial states close to the edges of the spectrum, the relax-ation p-rst ai'mes sc~.n become very slow. This scenario is further aggravated by integrable Hamiltonians, the presence of symmetries, and the observable studied.

Silicate melts and glasses are an important class of materials in very different fields, e.g. in geosciences (since silicates are geologically the most relevant materials) and inD tech u ology (windows, containers, and optical fibers). From a physical point of tout iew it is a very challenging task to understand the properties of these materials on a microscopic level, and in the last twenty years many studies on different systems li avc shown that molecular dynamics computer simulations are a very appropriate tool for this purpose (Angel letal.,1981,Balucani and Zoppi,1994,Kob,1999). The main advantage of such simulations is that they give access to the whole microscopic information in form of the particle trajectories which of course can not be determined in real experiments.

An alternative approach that makes clear the connection between axis inversion and spin without the same difficulty, is to invert the axes that are perpendicular to the velocity. Our argument identifies the \ [l',ha mi edn css of the coordinate system with the change of spin, hence inverting these axes should change the spin and does not impact on the direction of the velocity. We verify the effect of perpendicular axis inversion for momentum and velocity along the x̂3 direction and leave other verifications to known Dirac equation symmetries or exer-cises.

The relation between observed inte-grated colours for whole cluster population and MS population are fairly explained by the model predictions obtained in the present work. This indicates that the estimated observed integrated colours of MS population of MC clusters fairly represent the MS population of the MC clusters. Main conclusion of the present study are;

The collocation that ends with an adjective is created from a word combination adjective + noun in the original text. The adjective describes one par-ticular feature of the noun; this yields on a new collocation in which noun becomes the actor and adjective an object of the collocation. We assign the words ein a link-ing role in the collocation and represent it as a fact. The new collocation inherits the collocation numb cl; of the sentence, which it was a part of and thus preserves the time flow of the text. This way we achieve the unique sentence structure that we need, and keep the original semantical value of the text.

Special attention is given to the realistic scenario where the channel state is not known perfectly at the receiver. Rather, it must be inferred from available observations. In this latter case, the optimization problem becomes a partially observable decision process. This forces the controller to make decisions based on an estimated distribution over the channel state. This problem is cast into a dynamic program-ming framework with limited state knowledge. Known system dynamics and partial observations are combined at every step to update the estimated distribution and, subsequently, take action.

Tetramer-dimer phases
DIS processes provided the first measurement of parton densities. We saw in the previous sections that a combination of the different (weak and electromagnetic) struc-ture functions with different targets (proton, neutron, isoscalar nuclei) can be used to establish different properties of the charged partons such as their spin, charge assignment etc. The individual parton densities can be extracted from the data on F2 only under certain assumptions and one usually fits a form to these. The fits are constrained by various sum rules which are derived on general principles. However, none of the DIS processes can give information about the gluon densities. In the framework of perturbative QCD, outside the realm of quark-parton model, some information about gluon densities iso bain ed by studying the scauingviolation(q2 dependence) of the structure functions. But no direct information on the gluons is available from lic i processes. It is also important to note that since there are, as yet, no theoretical predictions for either quark / gluon densities, it is imperative to find processes other than DIS to extract combination of parton densities different from those measured in DIS, to supplement our knowl-edge. This, in turn, can help to get a more complete picture of parton densities.

Since the anomaly is not zero, the massless modes we know about can not be the whole story for theM-theory on this orbifold. There will have to be additional massless modes that propagate only on the fixed planes; they will be analogous to the twisted sector modes of string theory orbifolds. The modes will have to be ten-dimensional vector multiplets because the vector multiplet is the only ten-dimensional super multiplet with all spins≤1.

Strictly speaking, the topological protection is lost if the system strays too far from the instantaneous ground state and the Majorana mode leaks to the continuum (separated by the bulk gap). Here we cef i sider permissible velocities v(t)<v max so that we are never too far from the adiabatic limit with respect to the bulk gap. The evolution, however, does create nonadiabatic excitations within the bound-state spectrum of the domain wall, which are corrected by our optimizations chem c.

In view of these concerns, this paper is aimed at exploring the evolution of DB white dwarfs in a self-consistent way with the predictions of time-dependent element diffusion. Emphasis is placed on the chemistry variations along the evolution i ~ ry stages during which these stars are expected to pulsate. Specifically, we hope to address the following question: Is it possible that the diffusion-induced, double-layered structure could be altered by further chemical evolution to such an extent that a single-layered configuration emerges before tbtstar987 reaches the red edge of the instability strip?. In view of the lack of previous calculations of the mass-dependence of time-dependent diffusion profiles, we judge that this question is an important one to be answered. Additionally, we extend the scope of the paper and explore the consequences of diffusive ly evolving chemical stratifications for the adiabatic pulsation al properties of the models. Finally, the implications of our results for the carbon surface abundance in some helium-rich DQ white dwarfs are explored.

As expected, small values of Lresult in a larger effective beam in the direction of the scan. The shape in a direction perpen-dicular to the scan direction is not affected. Over-all, the larger effective beam size will result in a degraded sensitivity to spatial structures which are on the scale of the nominal resolution.

The most interesting open problem following from our work is to understand the extent to which the in equivalence between entanglement and nonlocality holds. With the current state of knowledge, our results show that there exist G MEN-party states that have a2-andeven3 - local model.

In a chain geometry the coupling sJ13andJ24 would not be present and the resulting RG flow always generates A F couplings. However, for extended, not strictly 1d objects, some of the gen-erated new couplings can be ferromagnetic (e.g.ifJ12<J13andJ34>J24 or vice versa) and therefore the decimation rules have to be extended. If a toneR G stepan F bond turns out to be the strongest one, its decimation will lead to an effective spinS̃=1. In the following steps, the system will renormalize to a set of effective spins of different magnitude interacting via Fan d/o rAF couplings.

Introduction
The proof can be completed for the general case by considering actions of involutions en solid pillows. In fact if αcorresponds to a mirror reflector ort0a corner reflector in B, the stabilizer of αacts effec-tively on a solid pillow. The stabilizer leaves invari-ant αand the singular set, thus the elements of the stabilizer are of order two. We have two possibilities: the involution either fixes pointwise αor exchanges its end points. If the involution exchanges the t;ron endpoints of αwe have two possible actions on the singular points of the boundary of the solid pillow. Distinguishing these three cases we can consider the action of the stabilizer of αon the solid pil-low and the action induced on the base orbifold. For each of the three cases the situation is different according to the parity of pan dq where p/q is the slope of the generic fiber in the solid pillow (here pan dq are considered coprime). Finally we have to analyze nine cases, but in eac we find that the quo-tient of the base orbifold and the base orbifold of the quotient coincide.
Finally, the shape of the spectra at low-bias voltage is indicative of aniso-tropic tulllleixng matrix element. We conclude that the tunneling matrix element does not have a strong dependence on the (in-plane) wavevector. Tunneling spectroscopy therefore probes states along the whole Fermi surface, including the diagonals of the Brillouin zone.

Then every maximal simplex in the chain falls into one of the following types:

In conclusion, the LHC750GeVdi photon excess implies the presence of yet another resonance at950GeV, that is the color-single tisotriplet-technipion,P±,3, in the one-family model of walking technicolor. The P±,3mass is completely fixed at950GeV, which is free from any detail of the walking dynamics, once the 750GeV resonance is identified with the color-singlet iso single t-technipion,P0(750).TheP±,3(950) are singly produced at the LHC via vector boson and photon fusion processes, and doubly produced by the (2TeV)technirhodecay. Those technip ions predominantly decay to W γ(forth c' charged P ± (950))andγγ(fortheneutralP3(950)). In particular, the charge dP±(950) signal is quite intrinsic for the W γchannel, which yields sizable cross section, leading to an intriguing topology such as dijet plus mono-photon (along with forward jets). This is the rare signal for other charged heavy scalars as,in models with the extended Higgs sector, so it will be characteristic only for the P±(950), to be accessible at the Run2,or3.
In this paper we restrict our attention to non-parametric estimates of the real space correlation function. However given the sensitivity of the measured cluster-ing to the weighting scheme adopted, we fit both the unweighted and the weighted real-space correlation function from Meyeretal.(2007). From their estimated correlation function, Meyeretal.(2007) calculate a correlation length for the HIP ASS galaxies. In this paper our aim is instead to interpret the astrophysical context of the measured clustering, namely the distribution of HI galaxies within the dark-matter halo population and the typical dark matter halo mass.

Despite of a large number of theoretical works on equilibrium and nonequilibrium effects in S/F/S structures, some important features of the effects remain unclear. In this report we discuss the influence of different relative orientations of the magnetization son the critical Joseph-son current in a tunnel SF / I/FS junction. Its electrodes consist of SF bilayers. The critical current Ic is not z~ro if the thickness of the ferromagnetic F layer is thin enough and depen@ds on relative orientation and absolute values of magnetization or exchange energy h. Surprisingly the current Ic turns out to be not decreasing, but increasing function of hin the case of antiferromagnetic configuration (the magnetization vectors are aligned in opposite directions in the electrodes). Therefore the critical current at nonzero h exceeds its value in the absence of h.

We identified two kinds of observables that can be used to probe this dynamic ef-fect. First, we looked at data on neutrinos from astrophysical sources, in particular, from SN1987A.If neutrinos from SN1987A emitted Goldstone bosons on their way to the Earth, they would have deflected away and the number of neutrinos to arrive at the Earth would have changed. Because the data tells,,, that the neutrinos travel from the supernova basically without interaction, we can put stringent constraints on the size of Lorentz violation. We also applied cosmological considerations to put bounds on the model parameters. We know that the CMBR power spectrum agrees with the pres-ence of three standard neutrino species. Signif-icant energy tras fer from neutrinos into the Goldstone field would affect standard cosmology, and would therefore be inconsistent with observations.

There exist several measures to characterize the performance of a detector. Furthermore, their relative importance depends on the specific application in question. The requirements for a good detector include low noise, sufficient speed and good impedance matching between the receiver antenna and the detector element. Different detectors such as transition edge sensors and kinetic inductance detectors excel in different areas and operation regimes. When considering anyone particular high-end application, the choice of the detector needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis, de-pending on the qualities and properties required.

To understand the relation between results obtained in different coupling schemes and make our Tables 3 more useful (for example, to expand the physical bases in terms of symmetry bases in the CS scheme), it is neces-sary to know the unitary representation (rep) transformation between the bases in the different schemes.

In this paper, we have proposed a new approach for the co-clustering and co-categorization of bi-lingual data when a comparability rne l)|tci ksa. exists. This approach, that could be characterized as a kind of three-mode clustering or categorization, is based on the concept of sim-ilarity induced by a comparability bipartite graph. The three-mode data analysis scheme is implemented as a mixing model used to merge native and induced similaril;y - - measures inside each of the two \ [kn? gui tic space.

While the uncertainty in the relevant parameters (namely, the distribution of Rb ubb of radio plasma, and the filling factor f, the Spitzer fraction fSP) is too large to conclude that visco-rotational heating is an important contributor to the thermal evolution, the study shows that the process should be studied further: It is clear that it must happen at some level when AGN-driven waves pass over the existing pockets of radio plasma, and under the right conditions, it can be very important in the extraction of energy from sound and shock waves in clusters.
The ad-justment of phase and frequency in1arge systems of oscillatory units can lead to global coherent oscillations, i.e. synchronization. On the other hand, noise and heterogeneity in the system can weaken synchronization, or even destroy it. Synchronization in the nervous system can facilitate the transfer of information or cause epileptic seizures. Multi stability and hysteresis of normal and pathological collective behavior is observed. When all oscillators are identical and the coupling tends to de-crease phase differences a state of complete synchronization is asymptotically sta-ble. But even in random networks with ~ ie nCol'? re t.ed and homogeneously distributed node degrees this absorbing state may not be reached or disappear when it is perturbed locally. Here we perform a detailed numerical analysis of the transition between di ft'cr. zut states of synchronization in a directed small-world network of phase oscillators. By varying the mean in-degree of the network or the nonlinearity of the phase coupling function at zero phase difference, we find discontinuous and continuous transitions with mean-field critical behavior.

There are two ways in which possibility (2) can occur. As described earlier, for any fixed region Λ Lthe measur cνt,τ (t)can settle into a pure state for almost all σ0and ω,but the pure state depends on the dynamics as well as the initial state. But a second possibility, that ilse bt yet been discussed, is that νt,τ (t)never settles down to a single pure state: the system is usually in a pure state α(t) locally, ba the pure state forever changes. Nevertheless, νt, the full aw ~' rage oven the dynamics, still yields a single lim il. This is to be contrasted with possibility (3), where even the fully averaged measure νt never settle down.

Among the nonperturbative properties of QCD, color confinement is one of the most important subjects remaining in elementary particle physics, and is also an ex-tremely difficult mathematical problem. The difficulty is considered to originate from non-Abelian dynamics and nonperturbative features of QCD, which are largely different from QED. However, n is not clear whether quark confinement is peculiar to the non-Abelian nature of QCD or not.

When calculable at all, phenomenological results in QCD are often obtained in a factorized form: a physical quantity is given as a product of a perturbative short-distance part times a low-energy contribution. The splitting into the two parts is regularization dependent. If one manages to evaluate the low energy part with ~ lattice simulation, one also needs the high energy part in the same regularization. This requires a perturbative calculation in lattice regularization. Such calculations are, however, tedious. First of all, the propagators are much more complicated than in the continuum. The simplest discretization of the bosonic propagator in four dimensions is

Here we report the first study of TIP wavepacket dynamics much beyond the single particle localization length and discover the new phenomenon of (tuantumcilnoticsub diffusion. This is exhibited in the weak disorder regime, characterized by the large connectivity of Fock states, when the packet size exceeds ξ1 but does not yet reach its asymptote ξ2.We find that in this regime the system demonstrates the two main signatures of quantum chaos: dynam-ical excitation of a wealth of Fock states and strongly non-Poissonian level spacing distribution. Based on tb is, we argue that the TIP sub diffusion in Fock and in real space can be described as subsequent excitation of un-populated Fock states by a multi frequency and quasi stochastic driving from a large number of already populated ones. Numerics and analysis estimate the sub diffusion exponent as1/2 in a remarkable correspondence to the strong chaos sub diffusion in the classical nonlinear wave equation. Asymptotic dynamics differs though, in the crossover to a weak chaos sub diffusion of the nonlinear case, and slowing down towards a complete arrest of the TIP ex-citation.

One ad-vantage of-Fun voi. procedure is that while many-body calculations in principle begin from wave functions and subband eigen energies derived from some Hartree calculation, the variation of these properties with density and the aforementioned kinematical corrections to the bandgap are usually ignored. By contrast DFT automatically includes these. Furthermore, the separate contributions from kinematic effects as opposed to exchange and correlation are easily isolated (to first order) by performing a calculation without the exchange-correlation potential (i.e. Hartree only).

Based on the relationships previously analyzed and specially in the analogous behavior between quantum mechanics and game theory, it is suggested the following (quantum) understanding of our system (classical and / or socioeconomic al):If in an isolated system each of its accessible states do not v4 the same probability, the system is not in equilibrium. The system will vary and will evolve in time until it reaches the equilibrium state in where the probability of finding the system in each of the accessible states is the same. The system will find its more probable configuration in which the number of accessible states is maximum and equally probable. The whole system will vary and rearrange its state and the states of its ensembles with the purpose of maximize its entropy and reach its equilibrium state. We could say that the purpose and maximum pay off of a physical system is its maxi-mum entropy state. The sys-tem and its members will vary and rearrange themselves to reach the best possible state for each of them which is also the best possible state for the whole sys-tem.
In above gauge, we get the effective Lagrangian which possesses the global U(3)L×U(3)R symmetry.

The model with dual mediators
Under harsh radio channel conditions it is not possible to ensure that all the packets are received. Neither it is possible to ensure that all packets are received before the deadline. This is due to the probabilistic nature of the ra-dio link, indeed there is a chance that a packet is not correctly received even after many retransmissions. RT XP is designed with the goal of avoiding probabilistic behaviors, channel access and forwarder selection are deterministic, so the behavior is predictable and we can ensure tha packets meet their deadline. Nevertheless, the radio channel introduces a probabilistic aspect thus one can legiti-mately ask if it is worth it to have a deterministic protocol on a probabilistic channel. In the next sections this issue is further investigated.
As the rate in the first interval 0.00<x<0.05is experimentally not ac-cessible in this analysis, we estimate the branching fraction in this interval using our Monte Carlo simulation to model φproduction.

Both the star formation process and the distribution of metals can be affected by numerical resolution. Part icj larly important for our model is the fact that the smoothing length of the particles (i.e. the radius which encloses ≈ 32 gaseous neighbours) determines the region where the newly released chemical elements are injected. Mosconietal.(2001) found that chemical abun-dances could be over smoothed in low resolution simulations because metals are distributed over a comparatively large volume and, consequently, are more efficiently mixed with surrounding gas. On the other hand, high numerical resolution could also produce spurious results if the metal mixing mechanism becomes too inefficient. Provided other physical mixing mechanisms are not operating, the simulation results might show an artificially large dispersion in gas metallicities.

As it stands, this functional determinant makes sense only perturbatively in weak fields, e.g. with the help of dimensional regularization.

The motivation of this study is to maintain the video quality unchanged by splitting a video flow on multiple path instead of decreasing the transmission rate.

Regarding fairness, which is a key factor in congestion control, the preliminary results show that even simple l?ad repartition strategies can have a very high impact on performances.

The weak dependence of the scatter on the feedback parameterization is an immediate consequence of how the rotation velocity of the galactic disk responds to changes in the ratio between stel-lar and dark mass. As more and more baryon assemble in the central stellar disk, their luminosity in-creases bj it also the disk rotation velocity due to the gravity of the additional matter near the center. This effect is amplified as the additional i gravity also pulls dark matter towards the center. Consequently a variation in the start o dark mat-ter fraction results in a shift predominately parallel to the TF relation which thus does not cause substantial additional scatter (see Navarro & Stein-metz 2000 for a detailed discussion)

The success of supernova(S N) models, confirmed by observation, often implies strong constraints on several kinds of new physics that could affect the supernova evolution too drastically; in the case of the existence of extra dimensions, and of neutrinos propagating in them, those limits seem to be very stringent if taken at face value. On another hand, even within the bounds, extra dimensions can rao if ySN evolution in some peculiar way, so to reveal their presence; and they could even have beneficial consequences on the flaws that SN models still present. This twofold connection is asr t)ng motivation for the combined study of supernova evolution and neutrinos in extra dimensions.

In this paper, we studied the stochastic kinetics of a simple auto-regulatory signaling module with negative feedback using path-integral techniques and numerical simulations. Within our formalism, all the statistical averages and correlation functions that characterize the long-time kinetics of the system are formally expressed as a power series in the feed-back parameter. Explicit expressions were ob-tained for mean values and correlation functions to first order in the feedback parameter. These analytical results were compared to numerical simulations. The simulations were also done in the strong feedback regime beyond the applicability of perturbation theory. In particular, we investigated how the system responds to temporal variations in an external stimulus, and how lbe?fee(lbgcldrc~n~at$e this response.

The detection of fullerenes in evolved stars as common as our Sun has opened the exciting possibility lb at other forms of carbon such as hydrogenated fullerenes, fullerene-adducts, and multi shell fullerenes (bucky onions) may be widespread in the Universe. In particular, if fullerenes and PAHs evolve from the decomposition of HA Cs, then both species may be mixed in the circumstellar envelopes of fullerene PNe, forming fullerene / PAHs adducts (at east thc at a condensed PAHs). Our IR laboratory spectra of C60 / anthracene adducts show that C60(andC70) and other unidentified infrared emission features could also arise from fullerene-adducts.
In this work we study mechanism of the tunneling dynamics of few-boson mixtures confined to a combined triple well and harmonic trap. The harmonic trap induces spatial correlations to one species, and sc we explore how such correlations affect the tunneling properties of the mixture. The tunneling dynamics is qualitatively different for different the lnt trl / ecc i-s interaction regimes. In the weak interspecies interaction regime, we observe a so-called correlation-induced tunneling, and in the intermediate regime, correlated tunneling between different species is observed whereas in the strong interaction regime, higher band states come into play, and tunneling is en-hanced due to an effective weakening of the optical lattice barriers.

In weak magnetic fields, the Landau levels mix and projection on the lowest Landau level is meaningless. An appropriate and convenient procedure is then to consider u tight-binding model for 2D electron shopping on a square lattice of unit lattice constant.

Web architectures today suffer degradation and disruptions due to changing workloads caused by 1)time-of-day(TOD) effects; a diurnal variation in traffic on most Websites observed throughout the day, and 2)Laboratic~h crowd arrivals (FCA); an unexpected magnitude of users accessing a specific website at an unexpected time. As a result, web architectures are modified to adapt to peak workloads which results to a significant decrease in resource utilization. Hence, there is a need for web architectures allocating the optimal number of needed servers for active workloads. However, the challenge in designing an optimal resource allocation policy is to minimize server resources without affecting the user-perceived Quality of Service (QoS).
We investigate the coordinate dependence of noncommutative theory by studying the solutions of noncommutative U(1,1)×U(1,1)Chern-Simons theory onAdS3 in the polar and rectangular coordinates. We assume that only the space coordinates are non commut-ing. The two coordinate systems are equivalent only up to first order in the non commutativity parameter θ.We investigate the effect of this non-exact equivalence between the two coordinate systems in two cases, a conical solution and aBT Z black hole solution, using the Seiberg-Witten map. In each case, the non commu latif lve solutions in the two coordinate systems obtained from the corresponding same commutative so-lution turn out to be different even in the first order inθ.
Another example is the double-slit interference. Rea-sonably, we can suppose the transverse momentum of the particle is zero. The state of particles exiting an interferometer is

Thus, in order to reproduce the spectral characteristics of numerous objects (both Seyfert galaxies and GBH sources) with significant reflection the model requires an additional reflecting medium which does not con-tribute to the soft photon field, such as e.g. a cold outer accretion disc, reflection on a torus in the case of Seyfert galaxies or on the companion star In. the case (~ fX-ray binaries.

The results we present in the next Section consider g≤50 which, for the largest value, is roughly of the order of magnitude of the Avo grado number. The adaptation of the uniform TM procedure to take into account the node dependent interaction constant depends basically in the identification of the basic triangular units and the \ assembling rules that combine them when one goes from gtog+1.A summary of the implementation of the details is provided in the Appendix.
The existence of the non-vanishing order parameters with definite transformation properties would mean the spontaneous breaking of the corresponding symmetries.
The fraction of binaries observed among fields ta~-s(>70%see,e.g.,Abt1983,Duquenn oy&Mayor1991,andReipurth & Zinnecker 1993 for the frequency of binary stars among pre-main sequence stars) is larger than the frac-tion, hitherto detected, in clusters. The size of the difference may be partially due to observational biases: binaries should segregate to the center of the cluster and may be difficult to find on account of stellar crowding. Or fewer binaries may have formed originally, some may be depleted by collisional effects and some visible members may be se,p od by exchange reactions for heavy, degenerate and invis-ible remnants. Many lines of inquiry (reviewed by Hutetal.1992) are being pursued to characterize the present binary content and binary binding energy distribution within clusters.

We restrict our attention to geometrically thin, radiatively effi-cient, stationary accretion disks, responsible for the observed bright emission around AGNs. In this case, as gas orbits around the central object, it radiates thermal energy away much faster than the time scale over which the gas par-ticles drift inward, and the disk maintains a thin configuration. Radiatively efficient disks are the mo\st aS is ivc among accretion disks, as the mass accretion rate is largest and the inward drift ve-locity is smallest.

In addition, while the innermost regions of early-type galaxies are expected to be dominated by the stellar mass component, the dark-matter mass component is usually found to play a non-negligible role, with mass fractions ranging from 10to40 percent of the total mass within one effec-tive radius (e.g. Gerhard et al. 2001;Cappellarietal.2006; Gavazzi etal.2007;Weijmansetal.2008). Even more recently, observations, as well as theoretical studies based on stellar population and dynamical models (e.g. Bullock et al. 2001,Padqan~blianeta.20@4) indicate that, for a constant IMF, the dark matter fraction in the internal region increases monotonically with the mass of the galaxy (e.g. Zar its kyetal.2006;Augeretal.2010),a trend that is more conspicuous in the case of slow-rotator ellipticals (To rtoraetal.2009). On the other hand, it has also been shown that the luminous stellar mass-to-light ratio scales with the luminous mass of the system (Grill oetal2010). However, information from stel-lar kinematics is limited to the central regions (a few effective radii) because of the lack of bright kinematic tracers at large radii, and the total mass determination suffers from the well-known degeneracy between the mass density profile of the galaxy and the anisotropy of its stellar velocity dispersion tensor (Binney&Mamon1982). Higher-order veloc-ity moments, which potentially allow one to disentangle this degeneracy by providing additional constraints (Gerhard 1993;vanderMarel&Franx1993), can only be measured with sufficient accuracy in the inner parts of nearby galaxies with current instruments. Despite great progress, it still remains difficult to separate the stellar and dark-matter components, mostly due to a still relatively poor understanding of the precise shape of the stellar IMF and its associated stellar mass-to-light ratio. Uncertainties related to the latter can easily lead to a factor of a few uncertainty in the inferred stellar mass.

In the binary lensing, the lensing system composed of two objects. These objects can be either (; i) a binary star or (b)astar with its (: omp anion planet or(c) any other combination of sufficiently high mass objects, such as black holes, brown dwarfs, etc. Increas-ing the number of lenses from one to two or more objects increases dramatically the complication of the lensing equation. One of the features of having multiple lensing is ile caustic lines on the source plane. Once a source crosses these lines, in theory we have infinite magnification and iu the observation, we can get sparks of light from the source object, In the case of binary lensing, either source star or planet orbiting around it or both objects can cross the caustic lines. The advantage of using binary lensing for (tetectilp;pIanet is that with an early warning system, from the deviation of light curve from the single lensing, we can identify an ongoing binary miciokensisg\évertt before the light curve peaks. We will show that the probability of high magnification of planet in binary lensing is more than a typical single lens.

The influence of the magnetic field on the dynamical flow of the infalling plasma around a compact objec and on the emergent radiation spectrum have long been realized in the theoretical study of very high energy astrophysical objects like pulsars, quasars, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries. Unfortunately no convincing theory has been well established so far which can explain the radiation from these sources consistently and correctly. Though the definite mech-anism has not been understood properly, it is generally believed that the radiation emission could be due to the plasma processes near compact objects like neutron stars and black holes. Thus it becomes necessary to con-sider plasma processes in intense-gravitational-field backgrounds, as such compact objects would be massive enough to produce significant spacetime curvature effects. Therefore one has to consider the dynamics of the fluid in curved spacetime which is quite an involved problem since one requires to solve the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics equations.

The Common Due-Date (CDD) scheduling problem involves sequencing and scheduling of jobs over machine(s) against a com-mon due-date. Each job possesses a processing time and different penalties per unit time in case the job is completed before or later than the due-date. The objective of the problem is usually to schedule the jobs so as to q fL cet the least total penalty due to earliness or tardiness of all the jobs. In practice, a common due date occurs in almost any manufacturing industry and its goal is to reduce both, the earliness and tardiness of the goods produced. Earliness of the produced goods is not desired because it requires the maintenance of some stocks leading to some expenses to the industry for storage cost, tied-up capital with no cash flow etc. On the other hand, a tardy job leads to customer dissatisfaction.

Let us now discuss the dynamical aspects of trajectories in phase space and how these trajectories are organized ill ter ins of the manifolds of the fixed points of the system under study. Each saddle fixed point presents four manifolds. Two of them are stable (attractive), in sense that trajectories on them converge asymptotically to the saddle point, and two are unstable (repulsive), where ICs generate trajectories that diverge from the saddle point. Each manifold is constructed using the direction of the eigenvectors ηat the saddle point, ob-tained from the expression Jη=Λη.
Here we shall derive the local factorization and commutativity relations which underlie the factorization of the general transfer matrix and its commutativity.
