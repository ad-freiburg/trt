3.1 Implementation of the GA Model
We separate the problem of FrameNet tagging into three subsequent processes: 1)sentencesegmentation2) frame element identification, and 3) semantic role tagging. We assume the frame element (FE) boundaries match the parse constituents, so we segment a sentence based on parse constituents. We consider steps 2)and3)as classification problems. In frame element identification, we use a binary classifier to determine if each parse constituent i saFE or not, while, in semantic role tagging, we classify each 1http://www.icsi. berkeley. edu / ~ framenet identified FE into its appropriate semantic role.2
Abstract
Informally, the first conjunct is satisfied by ally domain in which no word precedes "hat", and the second and third conjuncts are satisfied by any domain ill which no subject or object follows a participle (v part). The obj must be mentioned for "hat", although "hat" does not di-rectly govern objects, because objects may be placed by "hat", and not their immediate gov-ernors. The domain structure in Fig.2 satisfies these restrictions since nothing follows the par-ticiple, and because "den Mann" is not an ele-ment of (\] 2, which contains "hat". This is an im-portant interaction of order domains and prece-dence predicates: Order domains defines copes1 For more details on the exact syntax and the seman-tics of these propositions, ee(BrSker,1998b).

Lastly, for the purposes of this simulation, we do not distinguish between the syntactic roles of subject and object, and semantic roles of agent and patient, even though a more complex model may separate these levels and include a process that maps between them. Although these simulations conflate the syntactic and semantic categories, we use the terms agent / patient for clarity in linking to the Dick et al empirical data.

We describe a generative probabilistic model of natura lan-guage, which we call HBG, that takes advantage of detailed linguistic information to resolve ambiguity. HBG incorpo-rates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way. We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Tree-bank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence. This stands in contras to the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection it he hope of generating the correct parse. In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probab f listic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG, increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60%to75%,a37 % reduction in error.

Disambiguation. We have been assuming that the "correct" QLF has been chosen before applying our conditional equivalences. However, this is an unrealistic assumption in the fully general case, because it is quite conceivable that lexical disambiguation could require some contextual disambiguation first. Likewise, many PP attachment decisions have to be made on contextual grounds.

(Yankelovich, 1996)and(Kammetal,1998) explore techniques to guide users to produce well-formed queries, with a variety of strategies and tutorials, respectively. The above studies have focused on pure novice users within their first few interactions with the system and on the goal of task achievement. Here, we ana-lyze quantitatively the process by which users learn the language understood by the system, by exploring natural interactions during the course of a field trial conducted over a period of months. We analyze not only task completion or command recognition, but also the vocabulary acquired itself.

A set of SAIL programs has been implemented for analyzing large bodies of natural language data in which associations exist between strings and sets of strings. These programs include facilities for compiling information such as frequency of occurrence of strings (e.g. word frequencies) or substrings (e.g. consonant cluster frequencies), and describing relationships among strings (e.g. various phono-logical realization safa word). Also, an associative database may be interactively accessed on the basis of keys corresponding to different types of data elements, and a pattern matcher allows retrieval of incompletely specified elements. Applications Of this natural language processing package include analysis of phonological variation for speci-fying and testing phonological rules, and comparison across languages for historical reconstruction.

2.3 Adapting the models for poor readers based on psycholinguistic evidence The language choice models were adapted for poor readers by tightening the constraints. We studied the psycholinguistic and educational literature to determine how they should be tightened. We also carried out pre-liminary experiments of our own (Williams etal2003) which indicated that certain discourse-level features affect readability for poor readers more than good read-ers. Selecting more common discourse cue phrases and the placing punctuation between discourse segments were both particularly helpful for poor readers.

Finally, future work will mainly fbc us on how the system can invoke all existing information in order to generate new translations, mainly aiming at automatic and (sent i -) automatic methods for "recursive" as well as "parallel" utilization of multiple translation rules towards optimal "coverage" of new incoming sentences.
The "grammar in program" approach which characterized many of the early machine translation efforts is still employed in some of today's systems. Its primary justification seems to be parsing efficiency, but this should be a secondary, consideration for research purposes at present,s in oe most current systems are able to parse (or, as often, reject a sun analyzable) a sentence in under a minute. More important as research goals should be the ability to manage grammatical complexity and the ability to communicate successful methods to others. In both these regards, a syntactic analyzer using a ttm ified, semiformal. set of rules is bound to be more effective.

In addition to showing the theoretical advantage of being able to provide many of the fine-tuning capabilities of so-called semantic grammars within the context of a domain-independent grammar, we demonstrate several practical benefits to our approach. For example, the conciseness of our formalism allows shorter grammars than many previous formalisms would allow, at least for the intended class of retrieval applications. This offers not only added perspicuity but other benefits as well. For instance, we have been able to write simple (almos trivial) LISP routines that pre-process a grammar to construct he files used by the parser to increase efficiency and to perform valuable disambiguation s.

Other general common sense knowledge is built on top of this naive topolog'y. The domain of time is seen as a particular kind of scale defined by change of state, and the axiomatization builds toward such predicates as "regular" and "persist". The domain of belief has three principal sub clusters in this application: learning, which includes such predicates as "find", "test" and "manifest"; reasoning, explicating predicates such as "leads-to" and "consistent"; and classifying, with such predicates as "distinguish", "dif-ferentiate" and "identify". The domain of modalities expli-cates such concepts as necessity, possibility, and likelihood.
Speech Processing
Suri(1993) performed a critical analysis of the experiment that explained why other factor such as the in frequency of indefinite subjects in naturally occurring dis-course, the use of passive or active voice, certain lexical choices, (potentially) stronger reader identification with a victim / near-victim (or with a criminal), and order of text presentation could not explain the distribution of judgments in our experiment. For example, one may suspect hat the use of the passive asin$1 of both Example 5andExample6 may influence the judgments given. However, the experiment contained pairs of examples where passive sentences were used for $ 1 and one was judged ac-ceptable and the other unacceptable by the participants. Similar. pairs of examples with $ 1 inactive voice were included with the same results. Thus it must be the case that the judgments given were attributable to some factor other than active / passive oice.

We evaluate NE recognition with morp model and feature model since POS statistical data, which is extracted from labeled corpus, has some POS tagging error, and root model can not be implemented due to the difficult to determine what the root is.

Enquiry System (PLANES) \ [WALT78\]usesanATN based parser and a semantic case frame analysis to understand questions. Case frames are used to handle pronominal and elliptical reference and to generate responses to clarify partially interpreted questions.
In the present paper, we describe a partial parser based on the maximum entropy mod-elling method. After a synopsis of the maximum entropy framework in section 2, we present he motivation for our approach and the techniques it exploits (sections 3and4). Applications and results are the subject of the sections 5and6.
The NL Parse commands reflect these conventions and were included in the corpus to facilitate maintenance since it was usually easier to determine the correctness of the reference answer by looking at the NL Parse com-mand rather than the resulting SQL expression. In the event of an erroneous answer, correction occurs by sim-ply amending the NL Parse command.
A dialogue state and all agents that contribute to a dialogue state are shown in Figure 2. The Dialogue Model is used to classify the current utterance into one of the dialogue act categories (Jokinenetal,2001), and to predict the next dialogue acts (Expect).

Assignment rules are transferred and the sub-stitute for the axiom of DGtisadded,tSPGIandDG1 are very simple, with no embeddings and no optional rules. More complicated grammars give rise to problems of augmentation, especially for SPG. Even SPG I poses a problem.

A number of recent research efforts have explicitly grounded parser design on linguistic theory (e.g.,Bayeretal(1985), Berwick and Weinberg (1984),Marcus(1980),Reyle and Frey(1983),andWehrli(1983)). Although many of these parsers are based on generative grammar, and transformational grammar in particular, with few exceptions (Wehrli(1983)) the modular approach as suggested by this theory has been lagging (Barton (1984)).Moreover,Chomsky(1986) has recently suggested that rule-based parsers are implausible and that parsers could be based on lexical properties and structure determining principles.

The goal of this initial won is to assess human-human problems solving in the air travel domain, and to assess possible differences between human-human and human-machine interactions. It is clear that people are very adaptable, far more so than our current technology. It is not so clear how adaptable they will be and on what dimensions in human-machine interactions. What aspects of the interaction will require a technological solution and what aspects can be handled via a human factors solution? If, for example, it is desirable to handle only database queries, how difficult is it for humans to adapt to this restriction? This is but one example of a myriad of similar questions that could be asked using such simulations. The answers to these questions will expedite the design of efficient human-machine collaborative systems.

First we consider the problems of intensional logic. The model of intens lon al logo comes to be more complicated because it has a greater descriptive power than predicate logic in general. AsGall\[hi3 \] pointed out, valid formulas in intension a \ [logic fail to constitute a recurs \ [rely enumerable set since it is essentially based on type theory. Thus we have no axiomatization for this logic. For this reason, we must restrict the scope of sentences in natural language capable of being treated by intensional logic. But the notation of intens~o nal logic used in PTf i such as' "and' ~' work efficiently for analysis, For example, consider the following sentences.

2.2 An experimental procedure for understanding derived nouns and compounds In an experimental program, implemented in LPA Mac Prolog, we structured a very restricted lexicon of Swedish stems and affixes (basal lexical en t,'ies, BI.A) according to the approach outlined above.

5.3 Improving User Interfaces
4.1 Problems with Commonly Used Measures The Dice coefficient computed for bigrams (BI-GRAM) is an example of a measure that is demon-strably inappropriate for estimating word similar-ity. Because it is based exclusively on com-plete bigrams, it often fails to discover any sim-ilarity between words that look very much alike.

We then augmented OSTIA with three kinds of learning biases, which are specific to natural language phonology, and are assumed explicitly or implicitly by every the-ory of phonology: faithfulness (underlying segments tend to be realized similarly on the surface), community (similar segments be have similarly), and context (phonolog-ical rules need access to variables in their context). These biases are so fundamental to generative phonology that they are left implicit in many theories. But explicitly modifying the OSTIA algorithm with these biases allowed it to learn more compact, accurate, and general transducers, and our implementation successfully earns a num-ber of rules from English and German. The algorithm is also successful in learning the composition of multiple rules applied in series. The more difficult problem of decom-posing the learned underlying / surface correspondences into simple, individual rules remains unsolved.

It is intriguing that choice c, "Mike wanted to work for IBM, but they hired John", is probably the best of the three choices even though it requires the audience to do the most inferencing. Inc we have omitted state Ml-that John wanted to work for IBM-yet the audience is able to recover this information quite easily given the presence of the but. Given the ease with which choice ci sun demo ud, we are led to the suggestion that there may be a very general "template" being recognized here-that choice cis seen by an audience as an instance of the pattern: < expression of agent A's goal >, but <. realization of agent B's goal > and that this template alwa ~ carries with it the inference that the two goals must be incompatible and therefore A's goal has not be satisfied.

Hidden Units 0and2 are involved in the network's learning of vowel harmony. They both respond to consonants as well as vowels, but for the moment let us consider just their responses to the activation of the input units representing vowels. Hidden Unit2 respond strongly to the \ [- front \] vowels/a/,/1/,/o/and/u/,but shows negligible activation in response to the \ [+ front \] vowels / e/,/i/,/5/and/ii/.HiddenUnit0 shows the reverse pattern, except that its response to the \ [+ front \] vowel/5 / is not as large as that to the other \ [+ front \] vowels. The most likely explanation for this is that it is due simply to the low frequency of this vowel in the corpus. It is the lowest-frequency vowel, with only 44 tokens. These patterns are shown in Figures 9and10.

Type declarations are organized into packages. A package will typically include a set of related annotation types. For example, a package may declare all the types of annotations used to represent the document structure for one message format (header, dateline, author, etc.). Another package, associated with an extraction system, would represent the annotation types corresponding to the template objects created by that system.

Although the programs of Marcus andRies beck share many of these same properties, the syntactic processing aspects of those programs are not clearly separated from the particular conceptual representa-tions on which they are based. We believe that the parsing algorithm presented here captures many of the important properties of those programs so that they may be applied to conceptual representations based on other theories of natural language.
Most spontaneous speech contains dis flu en cies such as partial words, filled pauses (e.g.,?u h?,?um?,? huh?), explicit editing terms (e.g.,? I mean?), parenthetical a sides and repairs. Of these repairs pose particularly difficult problems for parsing and related NLP tasks. This paper presents an explicit generative model of speech repairs and shows how it can eliminate this kind of dis fluency.

Finally, the surface string "A bottle is a container", represented by nodeM226, is established to express nodeM75 and the answer to the query.

Thus the semantic structure is processed in a bottom-up fashion.

The goal here is to provide an automatic process that can take advantage of the large degree of similarity frequently found between different rules in a unification grammar by overlap-ping their storage or execution paths. While the modularity and declarative nature of such a grammar are well-served by representing each of a family of related possibilities with its own rule, storing and testing and instantiating each role sep-arately can be quite expensive. If common rule segments could be automatically identified, they could be partially merged, reducing both the storage space for them and the computational cost of matching against hem.

3.3 Generation architecture and aggregation localization While its overall architecture is a conventional pipeline, HYSSOP is unique in encapsulating all aggregation processing in the sentence planner and carrying it out entirely on a deep semantic representation. I contrast, most other systems distribute aggregation over several processing components and across several levels of internal representations: deep semantic, thematic and even surface syntactic for some of them.

We assume a morphological component such as GERTWOL(1996) to apply before the composi-tional process tarts. Composition itself is imple-mented as follows, relying on a separate lexicon for particles. The particle lexicon is hierarchically structured and lists selectional restrictions with respect to the base verb selected. An example for the hierarchical structure is given in figure 7 (with-out selectional restrictions for matters of simplic-ity), where heraus-is a hypo nym of her-and a us-.

Whether consonants should be allowed to correspond to vowels is left as an option in the current implementation.

P alignments often appear when a phrase in one language translates as a unit into a phrase in the other language (e.g. idioms, free translations, miss-ing function words) but can also be the result of gen-uine ambiguity. When two annotators disagree, the union of the P alignments produced by each anno-tator is recorded as the P alignment in the corpus.
The two kinds of presentation operators are treat e dif-ferently. Since top-down operators embody explicit com-municative norms, they are given a higher priority. Only when no top-down presentation operator is applicable, will a bottom-u presentation operator be chosen. The overall planning framework is realized by a function called Present. Taking as input a sub proof, Present repeatedly executes a basic planning cycle until the input sub proof is conveyed. Each cycle carries out one presentation op-erator, where Present always tries first to choose and apply a top-down operator. If impossible, a bottom-up operator will be chosen. The function Present is first called with the entire proof as the presentation task. The execution of a top-down presentation operator may gen-erate subtasks by calling it recursively.

Production proceeds by selecting a single random exemplar from a category, and then assembling a corresponding output. To simulate the warping of motor targets toward more highly practiced outputs, each speaker / hearer retains a record of what articulatory targets have been produced over the previous six rounds. An output target value for each target value recorded in the chosen exemplar is established by comparing the reference exemplar target value to every target value recently produced by that articulator.

During the last half century sign languages have been recognized as genuine languages. Thus sign languages are now accepted as minority languages, which coexist with majority languages (Neidleetal.,2000) and which are the native languages for many deaf people. Provision of information ac-cess and services in signed languages is as impor-tant as in other minority languages. Such provision, however, introduces theoretical and technical chal-lenges. The use of a sign language gesture nota-tion to drive virtual humans (avatars) for present-ing signing has been investigated (Kennaway, 2001).

Further possible extensions to the work could involve trying to specify a lexicon so that the generative process ends up with a structure with words as leaves, and one could also attempt to apply the rules in reverse, i.e. To start with a string of lords and produce a et ruc turd l description. Both problems are, of course, very d3fficul tones.
In the first part of this paper, we present our tool: a shallow? parser compiler. In a second part, we present output samples as well as several evaluations for French and for English, where the tool has been used to develop both an NP?c hunker and a richer shallow? parser. We also explain why our approach is more tolerant toPOS? tagging errors. Finally, we discuss some other practical uses which are made of this shallow? parser compiler.
742.1 Evaluating Focus-Based Approaches Sidner' s algorithmic account, although not ex-haustively specified, has lead to the implement-ation of focus-based approaches to anaphora resolution in several systems, e.g.PIE(Lin,1995). However, evaluation of the approach as mainly consisted of manual analyses of small sets of problematic cases mentioned in the liter-ature. Precise evaluation over sizable corpora of real-world texts has only recently become pos-sible, through the resources provided as part of the MUC evaluations.
It uses the rules of the grammar in a form where the meta rules have been applied, but the permu-tations implied by the LP rules have not been explicitly expanded. This means that we have fewer rules to worry about, butsilghtly more work to do each time we apply one (since we have to check that we are applying it in away allowed by the LP rules). The extra work is minimised by using the LP rules, at the time when the grammar is first read in,to index ID rules by their possible legal initial substructures. This prevents the parser trying out completely point-less rules.

For the relations, fire units stand for characteristics of the relation itself Note that this differs from most other approaches in treating each role or relation as a distributed pattern. This has several virtues. For one thing, it immediately eliminates the problem of specifying a small set of case roles, in the face of the fact that there seem to hea very large number of very subtle differences between roles that are in many ways very similar. Further, the use of distributed representations allows us to capture both the similarities and differences among case roles. The idea has been proposed on independent linguistic grounds, as well.

A second method that helped avoid local optima was the use of combined actions. In addition to single splits or merges, we search over segmentations produced by split-ting a segment and merging the first or second half with the previous or next segment respectively. In essence, this ex-pands the search neighborhood by including the neighbors 3and4infigure1.

The questions, "what class does a verb belong to?", "what are the relative frequencies of the dif-ferent patterns it occurs in?", and "is this pattern grammatical T' are intimately connected. Alterna-tion behaviour is a major source of evidence as to how a verb should be classified, and grammaticality judgements are premised upon the patterns a com-petent speaker has frequently encountered in their experience of the language. The further develop-ment of computational lexical semantics of the kind described in this paper requires foundational work on the relation of corpus-based statistical findings to formal knowledge representation.

Examples of such tasks include text tagging and indications and warnings. In a text tagging task, information of a particular generic type is identified, such as persons, companies, or dates. These types generally occur in a wide range of domains. The information is identified in the Pre parsing module and, for some types, must be processed by the Coreference Resolution module to eliminate multiple references. The output of such a system might be used, for example, to create indexes to documents for later information retrieval applications. Another example might be the display of the original text directly to an analyst, with relevant types of information marked or hi,ghlighted in some way.

Not only does a speaker plan for a hearer to identify the referent of a description, but he often indicates his intention that the hearer do so. According to Searle, one possible way to do this is to use a definite determiner. Of course, not all definite NP's are used to refer: for example, in the sentence "the last piece is the nozzle', the referent of the first NP is intended to be identified, whereas the referent of the second NP is not. The attributive use of definite noun phrases \ [6 \] is a case in which the speaker has no intention that the hearer identify a referent. Yet other non anaphoric u~es of definite noun phrases include labeling an object, correcting a referential mis communicatio u, having the hearer wait while the speaker identifies the referent, etc.' ~ To respond appropriately, a hearer decide ~ when identi \ [i cat iou is the act he is supposed to perform on a description, what part this act" will play in the speaker's and hearer's plan ~, and how aud when to perform the act. If perceptually identifying a feb' rent L ~ represented as an action in the speaker's plan, hearers can re as,,u a b<,ut it just as any other act. thereby allowing them to infer the speaker's i at;'n tions behind indirect identification re.quests.
