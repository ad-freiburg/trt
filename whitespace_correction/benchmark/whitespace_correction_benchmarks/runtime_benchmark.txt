Now, each of the ends of the string junction may terminate on any of the N branes of the appropriate type. Thus, we see that there are of order N1N2N3 states present here. Furthermore, since the junction must organize itself into a representation of the (0, 4) supersymmetry, there are 4N1N2N3 bosonic states and their superpartners. String junctions then account for the entropy of this configuration. Note that in this frame, open string states stretching bete_en branes are not this numerous. Thus, at least to leading order, the entropy is accounted for by non-perturbative states.

We start agai)nR from she 45n model iiud now ch s nge botil lh interaction range of one polar site, e.g. the site corresponding to patch 2, and its distance from the particle center in such a way that the quantity a2 + ρ2 remains constant. This procedure g ua ran t e es that in the corresponding coarse-grained system, the interaction range of patch 2 is the same as the interaction range of the whole particle, i.e. δ is fixed. For a specific interaction range, thereis thus only one choicefor a2 for a given ρ2, and vice versa; as a consequence there is only one the patch size γ2 associated to the choice of ρ2 and a2 or, equivalently, of ρ2 and δ.

We have also used both datasets to test the F LDA classifier with 3-fold cross-validation. As expected, due to the curse-of-dimensionality, the classification results were very poor. In fact, for Dataset-1 theaverage classification performance was only around 60%while for Dataset-2 it was near 65%. These results clearly indicate that regularization improves classification perfor-mance.

GAMA is a joint European-Australasian project based around a spectroscopic campaign using the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The GAMA input catalogue is based on data taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey. Complementaryimaging of theGAMA regions is being obtained by a number of independent survey programmes including GALEX eMeI$s5 VST KiDS, VISTA VIKING, WISE, Herschel-ATLAS, GMRT and ASKAP providing UV to radio coverage. GAMA is funded by the STFC (UK), the ARC (Australia), the AAO, and the participating institutions. The GAMA website is http://www.gama-survey.org/ .

Conclusions
A simple construction
This result is useful inthe approximate computation of multi-ple integrals over S. Together withfurther results of this paper it allows us to giveerror bounds of thecubaturesof the form of a conical combination of the values of an integrand at some points of S. These error bounds depend on th ?,e second order differential of the function involved.
By r e f i n i n g the arguments above, we now want to show lhUndertandingatol our solution holds for any table that is at least 1 unit wide. Sinceour laptop is also 1 unit wide, this probably takes care of most real life laptop balancing problems.
Limits of our model lie in its simplifications: one dimensional treatment, linear elasticity and viscosity, isotropy and homogeneity of material parameters including friction, identical properties of all cells contained in the severed region. However, the agreement between model and experiment is already good, and validates ~~e?sc? approximations a posteriori. We emplla size that one major goal of this model is to provide an order of magnitude of the friction to viscosity ratio ξ. We do not claim that nt?h;kin\ model is unique, nor that it is general. In the future we hope t.o further test the modelingredients and relevance on this epithelium and other quasi-planar ones.
We note thatwhen n = m the integral defining this inner product does not converge.

We are interested in whether matchings are sta-ble,and whether there exist stable matchings given a particular matching game G. In general, a matching is stable if no subset of agents has any incentive to reorganize and form new matchings amongst themselves. We distinguish between three standard stabil-ity concepts which commonly appear in the matching literature. The first, setwise stability, is the most general and encompasses the other two (coexvise stability and pairwise stab'ility). Unless otherwise noted, the stability concept used in this paper is setwise stability, whi,ch we interchangeably refer to as set stability.

We began by considering the action of a topological di stur hanc on a 2D X-point threaded by a uniform axial field Bz. The initial field is line-tied on all boundary surfaces, and contains no magnetic null but rather a quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) aligned t o the tube axis (here the z-axis). The absence of resistive effects means that very large currents can be expected to develop,in response to displacements of the lateral footpoints, over regions delineated by the QSL.

Figure 4 shows the properties of the gas in the vicinity of the explosion site within a 400pc (comoving) slice of the cosmological volume, ~-~- 1Myr, 10Myr and 50Myr after the explosion of the SMS. Comparing the radial velocity field (second column from the left) to the cosmological density field (far left column), it is clear that the blast wave propagates most rapidly into the low-density voids while its progress is halted in the direction of the high-density filaments, at the intersection of which lies the host halo. Figs. 2 and 4 also show the same general trend that, at late times, the most strongly shock-heated and highest-velocity material is located behind the shock front several kpc from the explosion site. The col e r material within the (≃1kpc) virial radius of the host halo is able to begin r e c o l l a p s i n g after 50Myr. As me discuss next, this gas is likely to form second-generation stars that are enriched to fairly high metallicities.

Now we turn to discussion of more realistic situation, when many pair interaction scatterers are pr esent in the sample. It is worth noting that in our mean-field treatment we neglect OP phas e, which i s a strongly fluctuating quantity in short coherence length high-Tc superconductors and, especially, in the inhomogeneous situation. In the present paper weonly study local pairing and do not concern the global transitiontemperature Tc, which is controlled by the phase fluctuations.

And, if observing a single but resolved source, the Visibility function willbe a decreasing function with baseline length and the rate of decr ease will be inversely proportional to the angular size of the source.For a source with a Gaussian brightness profile, for example, the Visibility function will also decrease with a Gaus-sian pro-file, and the half-maximum width of the Visibility function will be inversely proportional t o the half-maximum width of the source brightness distribu-tion.
In the next section we will outline the main techniques which we will use.
Another observation is that the results with K = 100 are not the best for the TREC 6 and the TREC 7 topic sets. The results with K = 100 show marginal improvements. Surprisingly, th e single-point representation of the documents produces bet-ter resultsthan with K = 100.

If the chain were periodic, the zeros would be distributed homogeneously on the unit circle (t hey can be calculated analyti\cally).In the thermodynamic limit, they fill the circle densely except near the point (1,0) on the realaxis, where we are left with a gap since we do not have a phase transition at finite temperature (i.e., for 0 < T < ∞). One might perhaps expect the very same situation in the Fibonacci case, but the latter Is always good for a surprise.

To assess h,ow re~tsonable this interpretation is we have considered two-field mod els as t h e simplest multi-field generalisations, and have looked at ways in which t hes e models can behave differently from their single field counterparts. Given that the two-field slow-roll inflation and the curvaton scenario have been studied recently, we h a v e concentrated on the Modulated Reheating ( mr) aud the Inhomogeneous End of Inflation ( iei) scenari os. Employing a geometrical ap-proach, we have shown that these two scenarios are very similar, though not identical.

In spite of its innocent looking, the Abel lemma is intrinsic for some sophisticated bilateral basic hypergeometric identities. In this section, we introduce the noti\on of Gosper pairs and show that one may apply the q-Gosper algorithm to construct Gosper pairswhichcan be regarded as certificates like the A b e l pairs to justify iteration relations for bilateral summations. Furthermore, it is easilyseen that one c a n compute the Abel pairs from Gosper pairs.
Based on these results we conclude that not only does agree our theoretical description with the nu-merical implementation of the mean field equations, but it also provides a ac cura te w ay t o quantify the physical properties of the interface.
The filtered complexes
In this article our aim is to show how the quantized one-dimensional harmonic oscillator can be described in quantum computational terms. This requires the in-troduction of a suitable Hilbert space, a quantum register, over which the computational processes are carried out. It turns out that, because bosons have no upper limit to their excita-tion levels, this involves a tremendous amount of mathematical redundancy. The Hilbert space dimension of the quantum register introduced is far bigger than that actually needed to describe a quantized boson, most of the states in the legtster being what we call transbosonic. It is in fact non-separable, i.e., has no de/lumermble basis, whereas the conventional Hilbert space used to describe the q u a ntu m harmonic oscillator is d e n u m e r - a b l e. We w i l l show exactly how bosonic states are restricted to a tiny subspace of the register and remain there during the quantum computational processes involved in the quantum register approach.

In particular, it wasnot based on methods of quantum state reconstruction by tomographically complete sets of me a s urem e n t s, which have often been used as a motivation for the introduction of joint probabilities. It is interesting to note that an expression for\[\[ joint probabilities can be derivedwithout any reference tojoint measurements, only by considering the structure of the operatorformalism and its application to separate projec-tive measurements of a and b.

As echo pulses are coupled out, the m a g - n i t u d e decreases. Decay due to other processes is apparent at other times. As the atomic coherence increases, thecoupling in also increases due to the interference effec t|.

Conversely, assume that k is an odd inte-ger. Then, every edge of G is a negative edge. Then, the bipartition (V1, V2) of the underlying graph G, where V1 is the set of all mono-indexed vertices and V2 is the set of all vertices having set-indexing number k, will form a 2-clustering of Σ. That is, Σ is clusterable.

Development of the Red Sequence in Galaxy Clusters
In the figure 2 of Croston et al. (2007) it is clear that th.e wings ext6nds farther than the X-ray emitting shock shells. If wings are deflected hy-drodynamic flow of the jets, they can not travel farther than theshock front. Hence, wings are older an shockis associated o n l y with the current (younger than 2.4 Myr) jet activity. This jetis clearly orthogonalto the central minor-axis gas disk (r = 2 kpc). In a case (3C 449) where nuclear dust d i s k is warped, Tremblay et al. (2006) has discussed about the cause-effect ambiguity between the jet to have shaped the warped dust/gas disk or the reverse. Gopal-Krishna et al. (2010) suggest rotating ISM as a possible cause of wing formation, taking NGC 3801 as an example. As proposed for X-shaped radio galaxies (Gopal-Krishna et al. 2010), it is also possible that a recent b i-nary black hole coalescence may have caused fast (within last 2.4 Myr) change of jet axis in NGC 3801.

One of the main problems encountered b? videoconference users is the presence of acoustic echo. Sound produced by the loudspeakers is received by the microphones and sent back to the remote users. This creates an echo, as users hear the sound of their own voicewith a delay. As v i de o c o nfe re ncin g app?li\-calli)ns incorporate higher sampling rates andmultiple channels, t he p r o b l em o f cancelling acoustic echo be-comes harder. One of the main difficulty in stereo echo cancellation is the strong correlation that exists between the left and right channel, making it harder or even m p osible to estimate the echo filter.

Nevertheless, the metallicity data give wd ue fome-~,h at higher than whatmight be naively expected from the Local Group hypothesis. Furthermore, all but one of the HVCs that have been measured are in the southern hemisphere where there may be some confusion with MS gas; the interpretation of the origin of the metallicities is there-fore not unambiguous one way or the other as Gibso n (this volume) points out. As is true for th e Hα test, it would be useful to have some of the small, high negative velocity clouds near M31 measured, but finding suitable background sources is difficult.

In order to shed light on all these issues, we have rigorously stud-ied the probability distribution of the system through microcanonical approach and shown that it stems from the interplay between any arh.i,tnrl':ary, system and the constant heat capacity of the bath. Only when t h e bath has finite and constant negative heat capacity, the system attains an inverse power law distribution with fat tails. The finite baths with pofitive constant heat capacity lead to the system distributions with a well-determined cut-off condition leaving no possibility for the emergence of fat tails.
The first method f o r reducing computational cost is to use the dirty image as theinitial condition from the SL1M algorithm. This reduces thenumber of iterations required for each run to converge, though it does not improve the processing speed of each step.
Here are some applications of Corollary 1.2.
By comparing the NPV of this second scenarioagainst the first, we can quantify the impact of ignoring costs when they are present.

Oscillatory primordial features are clearly not only imprinted in the temperature fluctuations (T) but should also be visible in the polarisation of the CMB, in particular the E-mode fluctuations (E). Both the fluctuations in temperature and polar-isation originate from the same primordial fluctu-ations and are simply convolved with dif-ferent transfer functions to obtain the observed CMB anisotropies. Thus any model that exhibits a TTpower s p e c t r um m o d u l a t i on n e c e s s a r i l y also produces a modulation in the EE power spectrumand the TE cross-spectrum.In this sense polarisation is a more stringent test for oscillatory features ahnd- there is no need to include a d d i t ion a l tunable parameters likea relative amplitude R discussed above in a combined temperature and polarisation search.

Another importanteffect, particularly for the low frequency instruments, is thatof di-rection depe,,dent gains. In most radio tel&scopes, the gain ofthe antenna is largely a function of the direction angles relative to the pointing direction. This is described by the pattern of the primary beam, A(l, m), where l and m are direction cosines ielatlreo to the pointing direction. However, there is also some dependence on the absolute pointing direction of the telescope relative to the ground, making t h e pattern of th e primary beam a function of the zenith angle, Z, and parallactic angle, χ, as well. For electronically steered low frequency telescopes such as the MWA, highly accurate compensation for this effect is a key issue.

(iii) The dI/dV spectra show systematic magnetic field dependence and the spectral features disappearat Hc of a given point-contact: In order t o inflec the. validity of this point we show the magnetic field dependence of an Pd/Pb0.6Sn0.4Te point-contact spec-trum in Figure 2(b). As expected for superconducting point-contacts, the spec-trum shows a monotonic decrease in the spectral features with increasing magnetic field. Beyond a c r i t i c al m a g - n e t ic f i e l d of 5 T , the spectrum becomes featureless and that is the critical magnetic field for the superconducting point-contact. The magnetic field dependen ce of the critical current is demonstrated in the inset of Figure 2(b).
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the proposed framework, focusing on the advantages of using graphs instead of po in\ts. Section 3 describes a concrete implementation of the framework, where 3-vertices keygraphs are used, and some successful experimental results thatthis implementation had for real-time objec t detection. Finally, in Section 4 we present our conclusions.

Energydistributionsaredominatedatlowanglesbya peak close to the beam energy,while the amplitude and energy mean value of the peak decrease when the angle of emission increases. The production of low energy particles in-creases with the target charge and mass. These ob-servations indicate that most of the emitted particles result from the projectile fragmentation during nuclear reactions.
For the pur-poses of comparison,in this section, we presenttwo extreme cases, thecase of no energy storage, and the case of infinite-sized energy storage.

When the procedure applied to the nearby clusters is ap-plied to a sample of intermediate-redshifts cluster, as the CNOC1 survey, an orbital-segregation is again detected. However, this time the differences is between the bulge-dominated galaxies and the disk-dominated galaxies, and the orbital-segregation is less strong than in the nearby sample. Moreover, when the orbits of the red and blue galaxies of the intermediate-redshift sample are compared the strongest orbital segrega-tion is found. This result suggests the orbital segregation seems to modify moreefficiently the star formation activity than the internal shape of the galaxies.

Introduction
Bilinear covariants
All f o ur quadrants are controlled by a common Processing Electronics (PE) of CZTI which also controls all interfaces with the spacecraft. Event data acquired from the 16 detector modules of each quadrant are packaged by the quadrant wise FEB andsent to the PE every second, w h i c h then further re-packages them into larger data frames and sends to spacecraft for on-board storage. Other functions of the FPGA based PE include distribution of power from the satellite to detector quadrants, forwarding telecommands to thedetectors, identifying the mode of opera-tion based on telecommand or environment and acquiring the house keeping parameters. PE a l s o has an interface with a GPS based on-board satel-lite positioning system (SPS). The SPS provides a pulse every 16 seconds with accuracy of 200 ns, which is used for absolute lm'e assignment for individual CZTI events. Though AstroSat is in a low inclination orbit, it has passages through South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region of increased particle concentrations. The Charge Particle M o n i t o r (CPM) on-board AstroSat measures pa~kiendeflux\ and provides SAA signal to all X-ray instruments including CZTI whe n particle flux is above a certain threshold. CZTI processing electronics detects this SAA sig-nal and issues commandsto turn off detector HV. Control o f overall AstroSat spacecraft as well as data down link from all scientific instruments is carried out from the ISRO Telemetry, Track-ing and Command Network (ISTRAC) located at Bengaluru. The Payload data is then sent for processing at the payload oper-ation centers (POC) for individual payloads and the higher level data is archived by Indian Space Science Data Center (ISSDC) located at Bylalu. The payload operation center for CZTI is located at the Inter University Center for Astronomy & Astrophysics (IUCAA) at Pune.

A megaton detector contains 6 × 1035 nucleons. Given such a detector and the forthcoming more precise determinations of atmospheric neutrino fluxes and cross sections, it should be possibleto seriously confront models with such an instrument (we discuss one realization below).
Anecdotal evidence and visual examination of some galaxies suggest that chaotic gas inflows often result in mis-alignments of newly formed stellar disks with previous stellar disk/non-spherical bulges, a nd t h e orbital planes of infalling satellite stellar or gas clumps do not always have a fixed orientation. These processes cumulatively may be thought to create s t e l l a r distributions in the central regions that are dynamically hot, which, in turn, provides conditions that are unfavorable to secular fomation o? stellar bars. We check if this indeed is the case.

We recall here that every finite distributive lattice admits a unique representation (up to isomorphism) as J(P), for P some finite poset (which in fact is easily constructible from the lattice as the s u b - p o s e t of Joinirredursib?les). In each of the cases described above, the bijection between the c o mbi n at ori a l objects described and order ideals of an associated poset P is easily implemented on acomputer. Thus, if we can solve the problem of generating arandom element of J(P) for an arbitrary finite poset P, we will have solved the problem of generating random d-factors of bipartite planar graphs, the problem of generating random independent sets in a general bipartite graph, and many other problems as well.

This is in fact already enough for most of our results about the four-dimensional counterparts of the Platonic solids, including their construction and symmetries. However, its inter estinng that one can in fact also show th e stronger statement tbat these polytopes have to be root systems and therefore induce Coxeter groups of rank 4.
Based on these results, it is reasonable to make the following conjecture.

We have studied the effects of DM self-interactions in collisions of galaxy clusters with particular focus on the resulting separation between the DM h alo of the sub-cluster and the collisionless galaxies. I~ our analysis we have m a d e the distinction between frequentcollisions with small momentum transfer and rare collisions with arge momentum transfer. Only when the fraction of expulsive collisions f is much smaller than unity, is it possible to have frequent DM self-interactions without violating obse rva tiona l constraints on the evaporation rate. When this is the case, DM self-interactions can be de-scribed by an effective drag force. However when f is large, DM self-interactions must be rare andan effective description of collective effects is not possible since only some fraction o f the DM particles are affected at all. Overall we find significant differences between these two classes of DM self-interactions concerning bothqualitative and quantitative predictions. It is therefore important to make a clear distinction between them.

In addition to the mass accretion, we also take the possibility of momentum accretion into account in our models. In the simplest assumption, the specific linear and angular momentum of the planet is not affected by the increased mass, thus the velocity of the planet in the disk isnot modified by accretion. But the accreted gas, depending on its position in the disk, may have arelative velocity with respect to the planet and therefore this simple assumption does not hold n ecessa ril y. T o account for this, we measure the linear mo-mentum of the removed gas in each cell and can add its sum to lhe linear momentum of the planet as we increase its mass. Th is w ay we av oid t a king i n to ac - c o u n t the rotation (spin) o f the planet around itsown axis and ensure conservation of linear momentum. Obviously the linear momentum an?d the orbital an-gular momentum of the planet are strongly coupled, so if the planet changes its linear momentum this way, itwill also change its orbital angular momentum around the star.

One other observation is that representation learning can be regarded as aspecial e~nps, of metriclearning; because for every mapping, we can define a distance f u nclion that computes the distance in the mapped space. In this light, we can make the problem more general by making the learner find a distance function rather thI(t,n a mapping. This is more challenging to analyze, because we do not even know a generalization bound for center-based clustering under general distance functions. An open question will be providing such general results.

An alternative method to etching is electrolytic polishing or electropolishing (EP) in which the material is removed in an acid mixture un-der the flowof an electric current. Sharp edges and burrs are smoothed out and a verj glossy surface can be obtained. The electricfield is high at protrusions so these will be dissolved first. On the other hand, the field is low in the grain boundaries and little material will be removed here while in the BCP process strong etching is observed in the boundaries between grains.

Introduction
The timing observations described here were carried out in the total intensity phased array mode at 610 MHz. In this mode of operation, the array needs to be phased up before ob-serving the target pulsars. This is achievedby recording the correlator dataforapointsource calibrator, solving for the antenna based gains and phases from these, and applying the phases as corrections to the output of the Fourier Transform stage of the correlator. T he a r r a y remains phased for up to a few hours and dephases dueto slow changes in instrumental and ionospheric p h a s e s . When this happens, one needs to rephase the array to proceed with further observations.

A set of SAIL programs has been implemented for analyzing large bodies of natural language data in which associations exist between strings and sets of strings. These programs include facilities for compiling information such as frequency of occurrence of strings (e.g. word frequencies) or substrings (e.g. consonant cluster frequencies), and describing relationships among strings (e.g. various phono-logical realizations af a word). Also, an associative data base may be interactively accessed on the basis of keys corresponding to different types of data elements, and a pattern matcher allows retrieval of incompletely specified elements. Applications Of this natural language processing package include analysis of phonological variation for speci-fying and testing phonological rules, and comparison across languages for historical reconstruction.

It is intriguing that choice c, "Mike wanted to work for IBM, but they hired John", is probably the best of the three choices even though it requires the audience to do the most inferencing. In c we have omitted state Ml-that John wanted to work for IBM-yet the audience is able to recover this information quite easily given the presence of the but. Given the ease with which choice c is undemoud, we are led to the suggestion that there may be a very general "template" being recognized here-that choice c is seen by an audience as an instance of the pattern: <expression of agent A's goal>, but <.realization of agent B's goal> and that this template alwa~ carries with it the inference that the two goals must be incompatible and therefore A's goal has not be satisfied.

2.3 Adapting the models for poor readersbased on psycholinguistic evidenceThe language choice models were adapted for poorreaders by tightening the constraints. We studied thepsycholinguistic and educational literature to determinehow they should be tightened. We also carried out pre-liminary experiments of our own (Williams et al 2003)which indicated that certain discourse-level featuresaffect readability for poor readers more than good read-ers. Selecting more common discourse cue phrases andthe placing punctuation between discourse segmentswere both particularly helpful for poor readers.

Not only does a speaker plan for a hearer to identify the referent of a description, but he often indicates his intention that the hearer do so. According to Searle, one possible way to do this is to use a definite determiner. Of course, not all definite NP's are used to refer: for example, in the sentence "the last piece is the nozzle', the referent of the first NP is intended to be identified, whereas the referent of the second NP is not. The attr ibut ive use of definite noun phrases \[6\] is a case in which the speaker has no intention that the hearer identify a referent. Yet other nonanaphoric u~es of definite noun phrases include labeling an object, correcting a referential miscommunicatiou, having the hearer wait while the speaker identifies the referent, etc. '~ To respond appropriately, a hearer decide~ when identi\[icatiou is the act he is supposed to perform on a description, what part this act " will play in the speaker's and hearer's plan~, and how aud when to perform the act. If perceptual ly identifying a feb'rent L~ represented as an action in the speaker's plan, hearers can reas,,u ab<,ut it just as any other act. thereby allowing them to infer the speaker's iat;'ntions behind indirect identification re.quests.

Most spontaneous speech contains disfluenciessuch as partial words, filled pauses (e.g., ?uh?,?um?, ?huh?), explicit editing terms (e.g., ?Imean?), parenthetical asides and repairs. Ofthese repairs pose particularly difficult problemsfor parsing and related NLP tasks. This paperpresents an explicit generative model of speechrepairs and shows how it can eliminate this kindof disfluency.

To simulatethe warping of motor targets toward more highlypracticed outputs, each speaker/hearer retains arecord of what articulatory targets have beenproduced over the previous six rounds. An outputtarget value for each target value recorded in thechosen exemplar is established by comparing thereference exemplar target value to every targetvalue recently produced by that articulator.

2.4.4 Exhaustive Labelings.. Every exhaustive labeling builds on a basic labeling, and is a labeling in which every line in the network is labeled with some value. In contrast to the conventional systemic labelings, in which labels are constrained to be atomic names, exhaustive labelings assign boolean conjunctions and disjunctions of atomic names as labels for some lines. The full definition of an exhaustive labeling follows.
To demonstrate this integrated approach to sentence generation, we show below the gen-eration of some sentences in two stages - firstly, assertion of knowledge into the KB, and secondly, the evaluation of a series of speech- acts, which selectively express components of this knowledge.

However, evaluation of the approach as mainly consisted of manual analyses of small sets of problematic cases mentioned in the liter-ature. Precise evaluation over sizable corpora of real-world texts has only recently become pos-sible, through the resources provided as part of the MUC evaluations.

As some verbs occur less frequently than others wefelt it was important to use a relative rather than ab-solute threshold. For a threshold of 1%, we disre-gard any frames with a conditional probability ofless than or equal to 0.01. We carried out the evalu-ation in a similar way to (Schulte im Walde, 2002).

F inal ly, the surface str ing "A bott le is a container", represented by node M226, is established to express node M75 and the answer to the query. In general, a surface sentence is generated to EXPRESS-2 a given semantic structure by first generating strings to EXPRESS-2 the sub-structures of the semantic structure and by assembling these strings into a network version of a list. Thus the semantic structure is processed in a bottom-up fashion.
Type declarations are organized into packages. A package will typically include a set of related annotation types. For example, a package may declare all the types of annotations used to represent the document structure for one message format (header, dateline, author, etc.). Another package, associated with an extraction system, would represent the annotation types corresponding to the template objects created by that system.

The two kinds of presentation operators are treated if- ferently. Since top-down operators embody explicit com-municative norms, they are given a higher priority. Only when no top-down presentation operator is applicable, will a bottom-up resentation operator be chosen. The overall planning framework is realized by a function called Present. Taking as input a subproof, Present repeatedly executes a basic planning cycle until the input subproof is conveyed. Each cycle carries out one presentation op-erator, where Present always tries first to choose and apply a top-down operator. If impossible, a bottom-up operator will be chosen. The function Present is first called with the entire proof as the presentation task. The execution of a top-down presentation operator may gen-erate subtasks by calling it recursively.

2 Higher-Order Unification and NL semantics The basic idea underlying the use of HOU for NL semantics i very simple: the typed A-calculus is used as a semantic representation la guage while se-mantically under-specified lements (e.g. anaphors and ellipses) are represented by free variables whose value is determined by solving higher-order equa-tions. For instance, the discourse (la) has (lb) as a semantic representation where the value of R is given by equation (lc) with solutions (ld) and (le).

During the last half century sign languages havebeen recognized as genuine languages. Thus signlanguages are now accepted as minority languages,which coexist with majority languages (Neidle etal., 2000) and which are the native languages formany deaf people. Provision of information ac-cess and services in signed languages is as impor-tant as in other minority languages. Such provision,however, introduces theoretical and technical chal-lenges. The use of a sign language gesture nota-tion to drive virtual humans (avatars) for present-ing signing has been investigated (Kennaway, 2001).

For the seen adjective-noun bigrams, we used the data of Lapata, McDonald, andKeller (1999), who compiled a set of 90 bigrams as follows. First, 30 adjectives wererandomly chosen from a part-of-speech-tagged and lemmatized version of the BNCso that each adjective had exactly two senses according to WordNet (Miller et al 1990)and was unambiguously tagged as ?adjective? 98.6% of the time. Lapata, McDonald,and Keller used the part-of-speech-tagged version that is made available with the BNCand was tagged using CLAWS4 (Leech, Garside, and Bryant 1994), a probabilistic part-of-speech tagger, with error rate ranging from 3% to 4%. The lemmatized version ofthe corpus was obtained using Karp et al?s (1992) morphological analyzer.

We evaluate NE recognition with morp model and feature model since POS statistical data, which is extracted from labeled corpus, has some POS tagging error, and root model cannot be implemented due to the difficult to determine what the root is. Therefore, in this paper we suggest the evaluation of the morp model, feature model and morp/feature model considering forward/backward view: (1) morp model based forward view [M/F], (2) morp model based backward view [M/B], (3) morp/feature model based forward view [MF/F], (4) morp/feature model based backward view [MF/B], (5) morp/feature model based forward/backward view [MF /FB], which combination of forward/backward view is based on forward-backward algorithm. We give 0.93 weight to morp model and give 0.07 weight to feature model. It is optimized from many experiments.

The NLParse commands reflect these conventions and were included in the corpus to facilitate maintenance since it was usually easier to determine the correctness of the reference answer by looking at the NLParse com-mand rather than the resulting SQL expression. In the event of an erroneous answer, correction occurs by sim-ply amending the NLParse command.
For the relations, fire units stand for characteristics of the relation itself Note that this differs from most other approaches in treating each role or relation as a distributed pattern. This has several virtues. For one thing, it immediately eliminates the problem of specifying a small set of case roles, in the face of the fact that there seem to he a very large number of very subtle differences between roles that are in many ways very similar. Further, the use of distributed representations allows us to capture both the similarities and differences among case roles. The idea has been proposed on independent linguistic grounds, as well.

A sentence generation corresponds to the speaker's speech process. Accordingly, if a sentence of good quality is needed, many factors of a speaker should be incorporated. However we restrict ourselves to treating only the syntac-tic and semantic factors. The pragmatic factors remained as future problems.

Suri (1993) performed a critical analysis of the experiment that explained why other factors uch as the infrequency of indefinite subjects in naturally occurring dis-course, the use of passive or active voice, certain lexical choices, (potentially) stronger reader identification with a victim/near-victim (orwith a criminal), and order of text presentation could not explain the distribution of judgments in our experiment. For example, one may suspect hat the use of the passive as in $1 of both Example 5 and Example 6 may influence the judgments given. However, the experiment contained pairs of examples where passive sentences were used for $1 and one was judged ac-ceptable and the other unacceptable bythe participants. Similar. pairs of examples with $1 in active voice were included with the same results. Thus it must be the case that the judgments given were attributable tosome factor other than active/passive oice.

2.2 An experimental procedure for understanding derived nouns and compounds In an experimental program, implemented inLPA MacProlog, we structured a very restricted lexicon of Swedish stems and affixes (basal lexical ent,'ies, BI.A) according to the approach outlined above. Each verbal stem was provided with a list of elements of its typical event refer-ent, e.g.: lex(\[ l~ir\],m(teach,stem),v,vt,\[ agent, sem_object,domain,place,time,resultl,\[\]).
For instance, any value for the lngredientOf attribute is automatically compared to tile Itypernym wflue(s) lk)r each other senses. This comparison reflects tile fact that maBy nouns are both the nalne for a substance and tor something which is made li'om that substance. An exanrple of this is the noun "coffee": in one sense, "coffee" is hlgredientOf of a "drink", while in another sense it has been klentified as a Hypernym of the noun "drink".

It uses the rules of the grammar in a form where the metarules have been applied, but the permu-tations implied by the LP rules have not been explicitly expanded. This means that we have fewer rules to worry about, but silghtly more work to do each time we apply one (since we have to check that we are applying it in a way allowed by the LP rules). The extra work is minimised by using the LP rules, at the time when the grammar is first read in, to index ID rules by their possible legal initial substructures. This prevents the parser trying out completely point- less rules.

Although the programs of Marcus and Riesbeck share many of these same properties, the syntactic processing aspects of those programs are not clearly separated from the particular conceptual representa-tions on which they are based. We believe that the parsing algorithm presented here captures many of the important properties of those programs so that they may be applied to conceptual representations based on other theories of natural language.

3.3 Generation architecture and aggregation localization While its overall architecture is a conventional pipeline, HYSSOP is unique in encapsulating allaggregation processing in the sentence planner and carrying it out entirely on a deep semantic representation. I contrast, most other systems distribute aggregation over several processing components and across several levels of internal representations: deep semantic, thematic and even surface syntactic for some of them.

A second method that helped avoid local optima was the use of combined actions. In addition to single splits or merges, we search over segmentations produced by split-ting a segment and merging the first or second half with the previous or next segment respectively. In essence, this ex-pands the search neighborhood by including the neighbors 3 and 4 in figure 1.

The goal of this initial won is to assess human-human problems solving in the air travel domain, and to assess possible differences between human-human and human-machine interactions. It is clear that people are very adaptable, far more so than our current technology. It is not so clear how adaptable they will be and on what dimensions in human-machine interactions. What aspects of the interaction will require a technological solution and what aspects can be handled via a human factors solution? If, for example, it is desirable to handle only database queries, how difficult is it for humans to adapt to this restriction? This is but one example of a myriad of similar questions that could be asked using such simulations. The answers to these questions will expedite the design of efficient human-machine collaborative systems.

Lastly, for the purposes of this simulation, we do not distinguish between the syntactic roles of subject and object, and semantic roles of agent and patient, even though a more complex model may separate these levels and include a process that maps between them. Although these simulations conflate the syntactic and semantic categories, we use the terms agent / patient for clarity in linking to the Dick et al empirical data.
Finally, future work will mainly fbcus on how the system can invoke all existing information in order to generate new translations, mainly aiming at automatic and (senti-) automatic methods for "recursive" as well as "parallel" utilization of multiple translation rules towards optimal "coverage" of new incoming sentences.

NL generation only makes ense when 1) The data to be communicated is already present in an existing database (knowledge base etcO (em-phasis added) 2) The users need the information, and want it presented as text (e.g., instead of graphically) 3) The volume of documentation justifies the expense of building an NLG system.
For words ending in superheavy syllables too, alternation exists only between R(egular) and I(rregular) patterns. The regular ones (final stress) are predicted with 96.80% accuracy for Encoding 2 and 96.35% for Encoding 3. The irregular patterns reach success cores of 55.83% for Encoding 2 and 61.67% for Encoding 3, again yield-ing a highly significant difference.
Other general commonsense knowledge is built on top of this naive topolog'y. The domain of time is seen as a particular kind of scale defined by change of state, and the axiomatization builds toward such predicates as "regular" and "persist". The domain of belief has three principal subclusters in this application: learning, which includes such predicates as "find", "test" and "manifest"; reasoning, explicating predicates such as "leads-to" and "consistent"; and classifying, with such predicates as "distinguish", "dif-ferentiate" and "identify". The domain of modalities expli- cates such concepts as necessity, possibility, and likelihood.
3.2 Preferences
We describe a generative probabilistic model of natural an- guage, which we call HBG, that takes advantage of detailed linguistic information to resolve ambiguity. HBG incorpo-rates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way. We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Tree-bank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence. This stands in contrast o the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection i the hope of generating the correct parse. In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabflistic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG, increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error.
The current study demonstrates (1) that the perceptualprimitive of contact (available to infants at 5 months), canbe used to perform event description in a manner that issimilar to but significantly simpler than Siskind (2001),(2) that a novel implementation of principles fromconstruction grammar can be used to map sentence formto these meanings together in an integrated system, (3)that relative clauses can be processed in a manner that issimilar to, but requires less specific machinery (e.g. nostack) than that in Miikkalanian (1996), and finally (4)that the resulting system displays robust acquisitionbehavior that reproduces certain observations fromdevelopmental studies with very modest ?innate?language specificity.

It is as well at this point, however, to sound a cau- tionary note. We have not yet examined in full thoee cases where de-elefting leaves a state-expression. The prediction is that these cases should not seem as bad as when de-clefting reveals an event-expression, but we have not yet tested the prediction.
F i rs t we consider the problems of intensional logic. The model of intenslonal logo comes to be more complicated because it has a greater descriptive power than predicate logic in general. As Gall\[hi3\] pointed out, valid formulas in intensiona\[ logic fail to constitute a recurs\[rely enumerable set since it is essentially based on type theory. Thus we have no axiomatization for this logic. For this reason, we must restrict the scope of sentences in natural language capable of being treated by intensional logic. But the notation of intens~onal logic used in PTfi such as '" and '~' work efficiently for analysis, For example, consider the following sentences.

The two main features of the technique we are using seem to be (a) the use of probabilistic methods for disambiguation of linguistic structures, and (b) the use of a corpus of unconstrained English text as a testbed for our methods, as a source of information about the statistical properties of language, and as an indicator of what are the important areas of inadequacy in each stage of the analysis system.

We assume a morphological component such as GERTWOL (1996) to apply before the composi-tional process tarts.

An example for the hierarchical structure isgiven in figure 7 (with-out selectional restrictions for matters of simplic-ity), where heraus- is a hyponym of her- and aus-.
A number of recent research efforts have explicitly grounded parser design on linguistic theory (e.g., Bayer et al (1985), Berwick and Weinberg (1984), Marcus (1980), Reyle and Frey (1983), and Wehrli (1983)). Although many of these parsers are based on generative grammar, and transformational grammar in particular, with few exceptions (Wehrli (1983)) the modular approach as suggested by this theory has been lagging (Barton (1984)). Moreover, Chomsky (1986) has recently suggested that rule-based parsers are implausible and that parsers could be based on lexical properties and structure determining principles.

In addition to showing the theoretical advantage of being able to provide many of the fine-tuning capabilities of so-called semantic grammars within the context of a domain-independent grammar, we demonstrate several practical benefits to our approach. For example, the conciseness of our formalism allows shorter grammars than many previous formalisms would allow, at least for the intended class of retrieval applications. This offers not only added perspicuity but other benefits as well. For instance, we have been able to write simple (almost rivial) LISP routines that pre-process a grammar to construct he files used by the parser to increase efficiency and to perform valuable disambiguations.

The questions, "what class does a verb belong to?", "what are the relative frequencies of the dif-ferent patterns it occurs in?", and "is this pattern grammaticalT' are intimately connected. Alterna-tion behaviour is a major source of evidence as to how a verb should be classified, and grammaticality judgements are premised upon the patterns a com-petent speaker has frequently encountered in their experience of the language. The further develop-ment of computational lexical semantics of the kind described in this paper requires foundational work on the relation of corpus-based statistical findings to formal knowledge representation.

(Yankelovich,1996) and (Kamm et al, 1998) explore techniquesto guide users to produce well-formed queries, witha variety of strategies and tutorials, respectively. Theabove studies have focused on pure novice userswithin their first few interactions with the systemand on the goal of task achievement. Here, we ana-lyze quantitatively the process by which users learnthe language understood by the system, by exploringnatural interactions during the course of a field trialconducted over a period of months. We analyze notonly task completion or command recognition, butalso the vocabulary acquired itself.

The goal here is to provide an automatic process that can take advantage of the large degree of similarity frequently found between different rules in a unification grammar by overlap-ping their storage or execution paths. While the modularity and declarative nature of such a grammar are well-served by representing each of a family of related possibilities with its own rule, storing and testing and instantiating each role sep-arately can be quite expensive. If common rule segments could be automatically identified, they could be partially merged, reducing both the storage space for them and the computational cost of matching against hem.

We separate the problem of FrameNet tagging into three subsequent processes: 1) sentence segmentation 2) frame element identification, and 3) semantic role tagging. We assume the frame element (FE) boundaries match the parse constituents, so we segment a sentence based on parse constituents. We consider steps 2) and 3) as classification problems. In frame element identification, we use a binary classifier to determine if each parse constituent is a FE or not, while, in semantic role tagging, we classify each 1 http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~framenet identified FE into its appropriate semantic role.2

Disambiguation. We have been assuming that the "correct" QLF has been chosen before applying our conditional equivalences. However, this is an unrealistic assumption in the fully general case, because it is quite conceivable that lexical disambiguation could require some contextual disambiguation first. Likewise, many PP attachment decisions have to be made on contextual grounds.

Thetagging process itself, based on the Viterbialgorithm, is unchanged. Experiments con-ducted on the Brown corpus show a recall of0.982, for an ambiguity rate of 1.233 whichis to be compared with a baseline recall of0.978 for an ambiguity rate of 1.414 usingthe same ambiguous tags and with a recallof 0.955 corresponding to the one best solu-tion of standard tagging (without ambigu-ous tags).
Therefore the temporal order has to be accounted for.

Informally, the first conjunct is satisfied by ally domain in which no word precedes "hat", and the second and third conjuncts are satisfied by any domain ill which no subject or object follows a participle (vpart). The obj must be mentioned for "hat", although "hat" does not di-rectly govern objects, because objects may be placed by "hat", and not their immediate gov-ernors. The domain structure in Fig.2 satisfies these restrictions since nothing follows the par-ticiple, and because "den Mann" is not an ele-ment of (\]2, which contains "hat". This is an im-portant interaction of order domains and prece-dence predicates: Order domains define scopes 1For more details on the exact syntax and the seman-tics of these propositions, ee (BrSker, 1998b).

Cross-document coreference analysis pushes the task into considering whether mentions of a name in different documents are the same. The problem becomes more complex because documents might come from different sources, will probably have different authors and different writing conventions and styles(Bagga and Baldwin,1998), and may even be in different languages.

We then augmented OSTIA with three kinds of learning biases, which are specific to natural language phonology, and are assumed explicitly or implicitly by every the-ory of phonology: faithfulness (underlying segments tend to be realized similarly on the surface), community (similar segments behave similarly), and context (phonolog-ical rules need access to variables in their context). These biases are so fundamental to generative phonology that they are left implicit in many theories. But explicitly modifying the OSTIA algorithm with these biases allowed it to learn more compact, accurate, and general transducers, and our implementation successfully earns a num-ber of rules from English and German. The algorithm is also successful in learning the composition of multiple rules applied in series. The more difficult problem of decom-posing the learned underlying/surface correspondences into simple, individual rules remains unsolved.
In particular the TIES system is described in section4.1, while the approach based on kernel methods isdiscussed in section 4.2.
Hidden Units 0 and 2 are involved in the network's learning of vowel harmony. They both respond to consonants as well as vowels, but for the moment let us consider just their responses to the activation of the input units representing vowels. Hidden Unit 2 responds trongly to the \[-front\] vowe ls /a / , /1 / , /o / and/u / , but shows negligible activation in response to the \[+ front\] vowe ls /e / , / i / , /5 /and/ i i / . Hidden Unit 0 shows the reverse pattern, except that its response to the \[+front\] vowe l /5 / i s not as large as that to the other \[+front\] vowels. The most likely explanation for this is that it is due simply to the low frequency of this vowel in the corpus. It is the lowest-frequency vowel, with only 44 tokens. These patterns are shown in Figures 9 and 10.

Examples of such tasks include text tagging and indications and warnings. In a text tagging task, information of a particular generic type is identified, such as persons, companies, or dates. These types generally occur in a wide range of domains. The information is identified in the Preparsing module and, for some types, must be processed by the Coreference Resolution module to eliminate multiple references. The output of such a system might be used, for example, to create indexes to documents for later information retrieval applications. Another example might be the display of the original text directly to an analyst, with relevant types of information marked or hi,ghlighted insome way.

In virtue of the aforesaid, the experiments on registration of the group delay in the Bragg reflection waveguides were performed on the samples with locally thin (see below) Bragg mirror, which provided possibility of local coupling of light into the waveguide. In this case, we employed the phenomenon of anti-mirror reflection, specific for the waveguiding structures with leakage described in the next section.

Homogeneous nucleation in a supercoled gas of Lennard-Jones particles is obtained by MD simulations. The temperature of the nucleating cluster is for the first time obtained every time step, and the simulations reveal that it is always a small cold cluster which initiates the nucleation. The temperature in a nucleating cluster fluctuates, but the mean temperature of the cluster remains below the temperature in the supersaturated gas until the critical nucleus is created. The temperature of the nucleating cluster changes in a systematic way with the degree of supersaturation. For less supersaturation an even colder cluster starts the nucleation (Table 1,Table 2). The initial results are obtained for five moderate supersaturations at a temperature T = 0.80 between the triple- and critical temperature. We have, however, tested that the dynamics are valid for nucleation of liquid droplets at other temperatures (T = 0.70 and 0.90), but further work needs to be carried out to clarify e.g. whether it also is valid for more complex systems like nucleation of water droplets.
In the few GeV energy regime the excitation and decay of resonances dominate the hadronic cross section. Therefore, all interactions fall in one of 4 categories: elastic scatterings, inelastic scatterings, decays and resonance absorption. In order to conserve detailed balance only 1 ↔ 2 or 2 ↔ 2 processes are allowed.
In this situation of totality of mutual correlations it is natural to consider a prequantum grand field. Random fields corresponding to quantum systems are simply random signals generated by such a grand field. Hence, this work can be considered as a step towards classical unified field theory. However, this is a very preliminary step.

In this section we give some examples comparing the different measures of exchangeability to each other and to the correlation coefficient, which is often used to quantify the relationship between two genes. We expect the exchangeability to highlight other relationships than the correlation coefficient since the latter does not take into account the specific experiment.

We observed V2275 Cyg beginning on HJD2452930.61 (2003 Oct 18) with the 1.8-m Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT). This was 790 days after maximum light. Observations continued the next night starting at HJD2452931.59. The CCD was binned 2×2 providing a scale of 0.4 arcsec/pixel. V -band exposures were 120 seconds with 30 second readout time covering about 10 hours over the two nights. The resulting images were bias subtracted and flat-fielded and instrumental magnitudes were measured using aperture photometry. Three comparison stars near the nova (Figure 1) were also measured and their positions listed in Table 1. Approximate V -band magnitudes for the stars were estimated from zero-point and airmass coefficients measured at the VATT on earlier runs with standard magnitude errors estimated to be ±0.05 mag.

The observation of the rotation of the plane of polarization as a function of wavelength in extragalactic radio sources has long been known to give unique information on the strength of cosmological magnetic fields (Kronberg 1994). This technique gives information out to redshift of about 2.5, and can in principle do this on the line of sight to a polarized radio source at any redshift.

Since the standard 2-parametric Chaplygin gas model causes too much acceleration, we propose to combine it with the standard 2-parametric self-decelerating DGP model, taking the cross-over length scales to be proportional. The proportionality constant subsequently disappears because of a normalizing condition at z = 0. Thus the model has only one parameter more than the standard ΛCDM model.

Clearly if R2 (n) > 0 then there must be at least one representation of n having the desired properties. Further, from our choice of c1 we see every representation of n is counted if n is of size N + o(N); if n is much larger, we are only counting the representations with each prime factor at most c1 N and could therefore miss some.

The most recent gamma ray results come from the FERMI-LAT observatory (Mizuno et al., 2011). These workers have examined the local region of the Outer Galaxy: specifically the Local Arm and the Perseus Arm regions as well as the IA region between the two. For gamma ray energies of greater than 0.3 GeV they found similar intensities from the Perseus arm and the IA region, implying a deficit of around zero. They found 15% less emission from the IA region than that in the Local Arm, implying a deficit of 15%. Hence, these values indicate deficits due to IA, SA differences of less than or order 15%.
To conclude this letter we reduce ourselves to mentioning some aspects of our analysis that deserve a deeper understanding.

The amplitude is measured with respect to the baseline. Firstly, the average of 32 samples before the arrival of the pulse was used to estimate the baseline mean value, as well as the baseline RMS for each channel, defining the noise. The baseline mean value was subtracted from all samples, shifting the average baseline to zero. The amplitude is obtained as the maximum value of the signal.

Diffraction methods are used to detect atomic order in solids. While uniquely ergodic systems with pure point diffraction have zero entropy, the relation between diffraction and entropy is not as straightforward in general. In particular, there exist families of homometric systems, which are systems sharing the same diffraction, with varying entropy. We summarise the present state of understanding by several characteristic examples.

In this report we showed our work about using joint deep learning architecture for car detection applications. The main idea of joint deep learning is to include feature extraction, part deformation handling, occlusion handling and classification in one single deep neural network where two layers of convolutional layers exist. The first layer extracts feature maps using low-level features that are tuned during the training phase. And the second convolutional layer is responsible for deformation handling to extract a score based on different visible parts of an object.
Currently, the HERA interaction regions are optimised for high luminosity running, with focussing magnets placed close to the interaction region. This sets a limit on the minimum measurable four-momentum transfer squared of about 4 GeV2 . These high luminosities are essential for the measurement of small spin-induced asymmetries and also for high statistics eD measurements. At low Q2 , event rates will be high and substantial upgrades of the front-end electronics may be required.

We focus now on the results of diffraction theory. Due to the complexity of the present numerical calculations for growing fractals (8 hrs circa of CPU Convex time for each run), our results are based in a statistics of only few different clusters for each class of complex structures considered. The data shown next is displayed for illustrative purposes, whereas the straight lines (used to estimate df ) are the result of our crude, but representative, statistics.

As the principal curvature spheres sα and principal curvatures καβ are defined on edges, not vertices, we lose the ability to look for points in the domain where sα is exactly perpendicular to p or q.

Course Structure
Two-step experiment assumes both measurement and comparison of the measured and calculated with the tested functions ρ = ψ(Eex ) and k = φ(Eγ ) emission probability of two correlated reaction products. There can be two gamma-quanta or particle and gamma-quantum. The function shape for probability distribution of their registration with the determined parameters in one- and two-step reactions is different. Just this difference causes different value of systematical uncertainties of measured nuclear parameters and high resulting reliability of their values in two-step reaction.
Now we are ready to prove the main asymptotic formula:
The results illustrate what occurs inside the memory as pulses are sent in. As the sent pulses are coupled in, the magnitude of the atomic coherence increases. As echo pulses are coupled out, the magnitude decreases. Decay due to other processes is apparent at other times. As the atomic coherence increases, the coupling in also increases due to the interference effect. This is apparent both as the larger increase in the atomic coherence at each coupling and as the decrease in the leakage of the sent pulse. Eventually, the other loss processes balance the increase, and equilibrium is reached.

Basically, the language designer using an LDA picks suitable language building blocks from the language knowledge base (language library), customizes them, and composes them into larger and larger language fragments. It may be necessary to add entirely new building blocks and concepts in the process, especially domain-specific ones, since it cannot be expected that everything required is already present in customizable form. The LDA provides feedback during customization and composition. Finally, the finished design is implemented by a language development system that serves as back-end to the LDA.

Before proceeding, let us specify the frame work and the metric that we are going to use. The cosmological principle, i.e., the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy of the Universe, implies that there should be no preferred point in the Universe. This is obtained when the spatial part of the metric has a constant curvature. The Robertson-Walker metric is the most general metric that merits these properties even if c0 is replaced by c(t), i.e.,

To conclude, we describe the behavior of metamolcule driven by the external field.

Anecdotal evidence and visual examination of some galaxies suggest that chaotic gas inflows often result in mis-alignments of newly formed stellar disks with previous stellar disk/non-spherical bulges, and the orbital planes of infalling satellite stellar or gas clumps do not always have a fixed orientation. These processes cumulatively may be thought to create stellar distributions in the central regions that are dynamically hot, which, in turn, provides conditions that are unfavorable to secular formation of stellar bars. We check if this indeed is the case.

Our future work will apply probFuse to larger collections with greater levels of incompleteness in their available relevance judgments (e.g. the Web track collections of later TREC conferences). We intend to investigate whether the performance of probFuseJudged and probFuseAll diverges as the level of incompleteness increases. In addition, the relevance judgments for some collections differentiate between different degrees of relevance (e.g. for the WT10G collection, documents can be judged nonrelevant, relevant and highly relevant). We also intend to investigate whether adjustments to our probability calculations that take this information into account will be beneficial.

If the autocorrelation of the coding pattern is not bi-valued with a single central peak and flat wings, then ghosts of bright sources will occur in correlation images. They can in principle be avoided by noting that at each of the ND points in the detector one measures a linear combination of the contributions from each point in the sky (plus background). Provided the problem is not under determined, the inverse of the matrix representing this coding can be used to obtain the sky distribution which led to the observed data.

So we only use these one dimensional irreducible representations to match the dimension of the representation matrix with that of the signal.

The results show that for small errors in the coefficients the estimated variance of b1 and b2 is also small and the estimate is realistic. The first case was computed without artificial noise, in this case the accuracy seems to be determined mainly by the statistics program. Adding noise deteriorates the accuracy of the results rapidly. While a relative error of 0.0001 (case 2) still leads to a reasonable result, the tenfold relative error (case 3) already means that the calculated uncertainty of b2 is about 7%. A one- percent inaccuracy in the data (case 4) gives a result even with the first digit uncertain. As case 5 where the number of data- points is raised to 2001 shows, increasing the size of the data-set may at least partially compensate for noise.

which can be solved for r and subsequently obtaining α0 and s. The drawback is that r and s are required to be integers, so we cannot arbitrarily choose m, n and ρ. To give an idea of the situation we present some tables, assuming for simplicity that both m and n are integers. It follows that also α0 has to be an integer. Because we want a negative correlation and because α0 ≥ 0 we have the restriction
The possibility that accretion disks play a role in PNe formation was first suggested by Morris (1987). More recently Soker & Livio (1994) and Reyes-Ruiz & Lopez (these proceedings) have explored the formation of disks in binary PNe systems in more detail. In these works there has been a tacit assumption that disk = outflows. Obviously there is gap in the theory and it remains unclear if or how accretion disks in PNe can create collimated outflows that match observations. I now review two classes of disk wind models that may be applicable for PNe.
Within our collaboration work is now ongoing to improve the existing models and to combine different approaches in order to provide detailed predictions for direct comparison with the rich observational dataset.
Here we discuss the high-temperature behavior of the contributions of branches (i), (ii), and (iii) to the total thermal energy density ρL of propagating longitudinal modes. Moreover, we discuss the role of branch (i), which dominates ρL , in potentially providing magnetic seed fields for MHD dynamos upon the breaking of spatial isotropy and homogeneity by astrophysically and large-scale structured matter.

We have studied the effects of DM self-interactions in collisions of galaxy clusters with particular focus on the resulting separation between the DM halo of the sub-cluster and the collisionless galaxies. In our analysis we have made the distinction between frequent collisions with small momentum transfer and rare collisions with large momentum transfer. Only when the fraction of expulsive collisions f is much smaller than unity, is it possible to have frequent DM self-interactions without violating observational constraints on the evaporation rate. When this is the case, DM self-interactions can be described by an effective drag force. However when f is large, DM self-interactions must be rare and an effective description of collective effects is not possible since only some fraction of the DM particles are affected at all. Overall we find significant differences between these two classes of DM self-interactions concerning both qualitative and quantitative predictions. It is therefore important to make a clear distinction between them.

This results in the following claim to prove our lower bound:
By assuming that very dense matter is made of weakly interacting quarks, one could try to understand the thermodynamic properties of the corresponding ground state by first completely neglecting the interaction between quarks. In order to construct the ground state, it is important to keep in mind that quarks are fermions, i.e., particles with a half-integer spin, s = 1/2. They should obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits for two identical fermions to occupy the same quantum state.

The periodicity requirement arises as a boundary condition in the process of minimizing the action. In other words only on mass shell physical string configurations are required to be periodic. In the presence of the extra zero mode the Hilbert space is larger. One must require periodicity in the physical on shell sector. The physical sector is identified as the subspace of states for which the matrix elements of the currents are periodic.
We now mimic the approach of M14 to constrain the amount of unbound hydrogen material in SN 2014J by both direct comparison with NIR spectra of other SNe Ia at similar epochs and by implanting Paβ emission features into our data.

In the case j = 0, it is known that Φs (3) is prime for s = 7, 13, 71, 103, 541, 1091, 1367, 1627, 4177, 9011, 9551, 36913, 43063, 49681, 57917, 483611, and 877843. It seems plausible that there are infinitely many such values of s but this remains to be proved.

Most detectors are not sensitive to the spin state of the incident particles. The results corresponding to this particular situation can be obtained directly from our expressions. For incident identical particles the dependence of the two-particle detection on the modulus of the wavefunction is in the fourth power, just as in the example of the previous Section.
We have shown that by using an Autoencoder to initialise the temporal weights of a TRBM, forming what we call a TARBM, a significant performance increase can be achieved in modelling and generating from a sequential motion capture dataset. We also show that the TARBM is able to learn high level structure from natural movies and account for the transformation of these features over time. Additionally, the evolution of the learned temporal filters are easily interpretable and help to better understand how the model represents the trained data.
We assume the PDC light is collected into two single-mode fibers using identical lenses (with focal lengths f ) both placed at a distances d from the fiber tips and M d from the crystal face, where M is the magnification. (We assume that the fibers define single Gaussian modes. See Fig. 1 for a schematic of this setup.) In this situation we can write the biphoton field as

Computational considerations
The second ingredient involves bounds on moments of the integrator that are uniform in the time-step size. These bounds enabled the local error estimates to be extended to global error estimates, and hence, pathwise convergence on finite time-intervals. These bounds are automatic if initial conditions are restricted to the known equilibrium distribution the Metropolis-adjusted integrator is designed to sample. To relax this restriction on initial conditions, geometric ergodicity played a key role to obtain such bounds. MALA is often ergodic, but because its proposal chain is often transient, is not geometrically ergodic. This transience is due to a numerical instability in forward Euler for large energy values. By suitably truncating the drift at high energy values, one can ensure the proposal dynamics is not transient. MALA with truncated drift, or MALTA is known to often be geometrically ergodic on infinite time-intervals where MALA is not. The paper used this property to prove MALTA is pathwise convergent on finite time-intervals without a restriction on its initial condition. We remark that MALTA can be generalized to explicit higher-order, multistep and adaptive integrators for overdamped and inertial Langevin equations.

The above modeling work is based on a scene recognition task using 10 categories. In real life, however, there are a much larger number of scene categories. Beyond scenes, general object recognition and face recognition are the two most important recognition tasks that are performed regularly. The relative importance of central versus peripheral vision among the three categories needs to be examined carefully. Using a similar modeling approach, we describe our findings in large-scale scene, object, and face recognition in the sections below.

By construction it is centered at a point ai,k associated to a tile Ci . Let us assume that the radius ri,j is a priori bounded by the distance between f k (5/4.Ci ) and the complement of f k (3/2.Ci ). Since ai,k ∈ 5/4.Ci , the ball Bi,k is contained in 3/2.Ci and can only intersect the cubes 3/2.C such that C and Ci are adjacent tiles. If Bi,k intersects Bj,k , the point aj,k+1 is thus associated to a tile adjacent to Ci .

We also note a false positive (a pedestrian being detected as anomaly) in the last image of column (b). Upon further investigation, this false positive was due to the fact that the cells in the region of the pedestrian had minimal or no activity during the training phase.

Notice that Nasdaq during the 1985 - 2000 years did not fall off more than 6 weeks in raw in the weekly quotes and more than 4 month in raw in the monthly quotes. Last time Nasdaq was down 4 months in raw in the period September 2000 - December 2000. Using the results of Table 5, one could predict with certainty (with unit probability) a positive move of Nasdaq for January 2001. Such a prediction would be the correct one.

It can be shown that these three schemes are in agreement with S̃(Γ) = 0 and thus with the gauge independence of tan β. Furthermore, they define tan β in a universal way, using only quantities of the MSSM Higgs sector.
Thus, the number of inequivalent observable sector embeddings satisfying the CMM conditions is presumably six; we take CMM observable sector embeddings 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 9 as representatives of these six. This does not mean that only six models of this type exist. For each choice of the six inequivalent {VA , a1A , a3A } there will be many possible hidden sector embeddings {VB , a1B , a3B }, not all of which are equivalent. CMM have left the hidden sector embedding unspecified and the purpose of this paper is to enumerate the allowed ways (up to equivalences) of embedding the hidden sector.

Conclusions
In preview of the paper layout, we begin by introducing the reaction-diffusion equations that we will use as the drive system. We discuss how this system is solved numerically and the parameters used to simulate complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Next, we implement the response system and show the parameter PDEs used to find autosynchronization. We demonstrate the power of the systems of PDEs to autosynchronize by employing three different spatial functions for the parameters. Next, we show the estimated parameters and the convergence plots for both state variables and parameters to the correct values. Finally, we give an improvement on the response system that admits autosynchronization wherein only one species is sampled, which is an important breakthrough for applications since generally only the phytoplankton is easily observable.

It also yields a solid foundation for the comparison of different EAs or different heuristic paradigms. This includes the question in how far design choices affect performance such as the choice of representations, operators, and parameters. In some cases running time analyses allow to draw conclusions about optimal parameter settings. Some of the above questions can be answered. Last but not least, theoretical analyses lead to insight into the working principles of EAs and to a better understanding of their behavior.

We have shown how restricted quasi-Kronecker matrices can be block rotated and factorised, and how this enables efficient inference in the two-level functional additive model.

Tunka-Rex is a digital radio array for the detection of air showers in Siberia. Besides determining the precision and overall benefit of a radio detector in combination with an air-Cherenkov detector, its goal is to determine the absolute scale of radio emission. Therefore, we performed an absolute calibration with a commercially available reference source, reaching an accuracy for an individual amplitude measurement of 22%, including 18% uncertainty on the absolute scale. The same reference source was also used by LOPES and LOFAR. These three experiments now have a consistent amplitude calibration. Comparing the measured amplitudes to the predictions of the simulation code CoREAS, we find agreement within the uncertainties. Therefore, Tunka-Rex confirms the applicability of CoREAS for the simulation of absolute amplitudes of radio emission by air showers. It also provides a measure of the absolute scale of radio amplitudes in its frequency band.
Another important effect, particularly for the low frequency instruments, is that of direction dependent gains. In most radio telescopes, the gain of the antenna is largely a function of the direction angles relative to the pointing direction. This is described by the pattern of the primary beam, A(l, m), where l and m are direction cosines relative to the pointing direction. However, there is also some dependence on the absolute pointing direction of the telescope relative to the ground, making the pattern of the primary beam a function of the zenith angle, Z, and parallactic angle, χ, as well. For electronically steered low frequency telescopes such as the MWA, highly accurate compensation for this effect is a key issue.

So far, the few proper motion measurements available for LG dwarf galaxies seem to indicate that the latter have low eccentricity orbits (e.g. the Magellanic Clouds in Kroupa & Bastian 1997 and Sculptor in Schweitzer et al. 1995). If this result will be confirmed by the forthcoming generation of high-precision astrometric missions, like GAIA and SIM, the outer flattening observed in the stellar profiles of dSphs will be hardly explained within CDM models. Recently, Eke et al. (2000) have shown that in warm dark matter models small galaxy halos have NFW profiles with c < 5; these cosmologies would easily match the observations and, in addition, could yield the correct number of satellites in galaxy halos (Moore et al. 1999) as well as halo profiles soft enough to reproduce the rotation curves of LSB galaxies (de Blok et al. 2000).

Nevertheless, the metallicity data give values somewhat higher than what might be naively expected from the Local Group hypothesis. Furthermore, all but one of the HVCs that have been measured are in the southern hemisphere where there may be some confusion with MS gas; the interpretation of the origin of the metallicities is therefore not unambiguous one way or the other as Gibson (this volume) points out. As is true for the Hα test, it would be useful to have some of the small, high negative velocity clouds near M31 measured, but finding suitable background sources is difficult.

Deep reflectance codes give us a compact representation that encodes the reflectance disks which we expect to encode rich information about the physical properties of the material itself. We are particularly interested in probing tactile properties of a surface from its reflectance appearance. For this, we focus on estimating friction from reflectance disks. In this section, we introduce the first-of-its-kind friction-reflectance database and then apply deep reflectance codes to estimate friction from one-shot in-field reflectance disks.

A common problem in computational physics is computing the eigenpairs of large matrices. We will present a new Monte Carlo algorithm that allows the simultaneous determination of a few extremal eigenpairs of a very large matrix without the need to orthogonalize pairs of vectors to each other or store all the components of any vector.
We chose to compare against the uRNN architecture because it set state of the art results in terms of both data complexity and accuracy and because it is an architecture with similar design objectives as low-rank passthrough architectures, namely a low-dimensional parametrization and the mitigation of the vanishing gradient problem, but it is based on quite different principles (it does not use a state passthrough as defined in this work, instead it relies on the reversibility and norm-preservation properties of unitary matrices in order preserve state information between time steps, and uses a multiplicative unitary decomposition in order to achieve low-dimensional parametrization).

In this work we take seriously the last possibility, and investigate the idea of introducing a modified MPP to predict the SM Higgs boson mass from the requirement that our vacuum has only barely survived early cosmology (call it metastability MPP). We shall ask if there should be reasons that MPP ideas might after all lead to metastability MPP. Further we shall ask, phenomenologically, whether such a metastability MPP fits the data.
A great deal of observational firepower will be directed at the problem of star formation in the coming years, but we already know one essential fact: star formation is a collective process. Most stars (perhaps nearly 100% in our Galaxy) form in clusters. There are strong interactions with the surrounding environment and among protostars. Quantifying feedback processes, both positive and negative, is a key to understanding star formation. All this means that star formation is a more difficult problem than was the astrophysics of isolated stars. Progress will be importantly informed by observations of other galaxies and a wider range of environments than are found in our Galaxy.

Critical KS sets are sets of IDs as described above. Again, the IDs in a KS set need not be critical in the sense given for IDs, but instead the KS will be called critical if no subset of IDs and/or qubits can be removed from the set such that a smaller KS set remains. These critical KS sets are then the minimal structures in the N -qubit Pauli group that demonstrate quantum contextuality.

For a source with a Gaussian brightness profile, for example, the Visibility function will also decrease with a Gaussian profile, and the half-maximum width of the Visibility function will be inversely proportional to the half-maximum width of the source brightness distribution.

Generally, we can expect two competing rates. First is the characteristic root elongation rate, directed downwards and second is the evapotranspiration rate directed upwards. The latter can be divided into the transpiration and evaporation components. It is clear that the root elongation rate would ultimately depend on the evaporation conditions as water serves as a major limiting factor in its growth. At low humidity conditions, we expect the evapotranspiration rate to be faster, thus the development of the evaporation front, zsup also occurs fast. When this happens, the evaporating front, zsup , eventually catches up with the root tip and quickly exposes a large portion of the total root system to a dry zone. The appearance of the dry zone certainly decreases water absorption rates.

Lensing refers to the magnification and/or appearance of multiple images of the cosmic-ray source due to uncorrelated deflections in the magnetic field. It roughly corresponds to the transition between the two realms mentioned above. This is an attractive possibility for using the observed angular distribution to infer greater details about the intervening magnetic field. For distant sources, the lensing effects are strongest near the critical energy,

The following γ-hadron selection cuts have been used: candidate events are accepted as γ-rays if MSCW < 0.3, MSCL < 0.45, and Θ2 < 0.015 deg2 .

All results are then scaled to the opening angle of Θ2 < 0.015 deg2 .).
It is interesting to note that regulation policies for the lowest and the higher layers are closer to each other than the middle ones. Policies to regulate the poorest layer will also contribute positively in regulating the upper ones. The middle layers follow a different dynamics on its own mostly due to the fact that they receive and send family units from both sides of the distribution.
