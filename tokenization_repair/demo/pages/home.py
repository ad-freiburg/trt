    This demo lets you explore tokenization repair models. You
    can run an interactive demo, run benchmarks, inspect the models and more.

    To start, open the **sidebar on the left** (if not already open) and choose the page you want to go to
    in the navigation. You can also configure other **options** there, e.g. which
    model to use and on which device you want to run it.
