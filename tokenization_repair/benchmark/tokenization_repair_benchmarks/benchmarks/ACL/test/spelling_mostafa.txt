The file-type table simply tells M-COOL whether the given knowledge source is lexical or semantic, and whether it is for generation or analysis. It also supplies miscellaneous information such as the name of the file where the run-time entries are kept and whether it can be compiled using the LISP compile command. For example, our Spanish-lexical-analysis file-type is defined with this entry:
we will ignore the escape symbol (Z) that should precede any special characters (e.g., +) used in these rules.

Although the programs of Marcus and Riesbeck share many of these same properties, the syntactic processing aspects of those programs are not clearly separated from the particular conceptual representations on which they are based. We believe that the parsing algorithm presented here captures many of the important properties of those programs so that they may be applied to conceptual representations based on other theories of natural language.
Most spontaneous speech contains disfluencies such as partial words, filled pauses (e.g., ? uh?, ?um?, ?huh?), explicit editing terms (e.g., ?I mean?), parenthetical asides and repairs. Of these repairs pose particularly difficult problems for parsing and related NLP tasks. This paper presents an explicit generative model of speech repairs and shows how it can eliminate this kind of disfluency.
extended in order to maintain a coherent discourse structure for the modelling of the producer. Thus rhetorical relations describing planning processes are introduced. With these, the discourse grammar becomes capable of representing a coherent discourse structure for the spoken language despite the fact that the entire discourse segment does not seem as coherent as written text.

Finally, the surface string "A bottle is a container", represented by node M226, is established to express node M75 and the answer to the query. In general, a surface sentence is generated to EXPRESS-2 a given semantic structure by first generating strings to EXPRESS-2 the substructures of the semantic structure and by assembling these strings into a network version of a list. Thus the semantic structure is processed in a bottom-up fashion.

The goal here is to provide an automatic process that can take advantage of the large degree of similarity frequently found between different rules in a unification grammar by overlapping their storage or execution paths. While the modularity and declarative nature of such a grammar are well-served by representing each of a family of related possibilities with its own rule, storing and testing and instantiating each role separately can be quite expensive. If common rule segments could be automatically identified, they could be partially merged, reducing both the storage space for them and the computational cost of matching against hem.

For the seen adjective-noun bigrams, we used the data of Lapata, McDonald, and Keller (1999), who compiled a set of 90 bigrams as follows. First, 30 adjectives were randomly chosen from a part-of-speech-tagged and lemmatized version of the BNC so that each adjective had exactly two senses according to WordNet (Miller et al 1990) and was unambiguously tagged as ? adjective? 98.6% of the time. Lapata, McDonald, and Keller used the part-of-speech-tagged version that is made available with the BNC and was tagged using CLAWS4 (Leech, Garside, and Bryant 1994), a probabilistic part-of-speech tagger, with error rate ranging from 3% to 4%. The lemmatized version of the corpus was obtained using Karp et al? s (1992) morphological analyzer.

2 Higher-Order Unification and NL semantics The basic idea underlying the use of HOU for NL semantics i very simple: the typed Î»-calculus is used as a semantic representation language while semantically under-specified elements (e.g. anaphors and ellipses) are represented by free variables whose value is determined by solving higher-order equations. For instance, the discourse (la) has (lb) as a semantic representation where the value of R is given by equation (lc) with solutions (ld) and (le).

We assume a morphological component such as GERTWOL (1996) to apply before the compositional process tarts. Composition itself is implemented as follows, relying on a separate lexicon for particles. The particle lexicon is hierarchically structured and lists selectional restrictions with respect to the base verb selected. An example for the hierarchical structure is given in figure 7 (without selectional restrictions for matters of simplicity), where heraus- is a hyponym of her- and aus-.

Disallowing correspondences between vowels and consonants vastly improved the performance of the algorithm. No human intervention is needed to identify vowels from consonants, an improved version of an algorithm described in Suhotin 1962 being used to identify characters which represent vowel sounds. Whether consonants should be allowed to correspond to vowels is left as an option in the current implementation.

Figure 1: Alignment Example with Crossing biguous while P alignments are those which are less certain. P alignments often appear when a phrase in one language translates as a unit into a phrase in the other language (e.g. idioms, free translations, missing function words) but can also be the result of genuine ambiguity. When two annotators disagree, the union of the P alignments produced by each annotator is recorded as the P alignment in the corpus.
The two kinds of presentation operators are treated differently. Since top-down operators embody explicit communicative norms, they are given a higher priority. Only when no top-down presentation operator is applicable, will a bottom-up presentation operator be chosen. The overall planning framework is realized by a function called Present. Taking as input a subproof, Present repeatedly executes a basic planning cycle until the input subproof is conveyed. Each cycle carries out one presentation operator, where Present always tries first to choose and apply a top-down operator. If impossible, a bottom-up operator will be chosen. The function Present is first called with the entire proof as the presentation task. The execution of a top-down presentation operator may generate subtasks by calling it recursively.

Production proceeds by selecting a single random exemplar from a category, and then assembling a corresponding output. To simulate the warping of motor targets toward more highly practiced outputs, each speaker/hearer retains a record of what articulatory targets have been produced over the previous six rounds. An output target value for each target value recorded in the chosen exemplar is established by comparing the reference exemplar target value to every target value recently produced by that articulator.

During the last half century sign languages have been recognized as genuine languages. Thus sign languages are now accepted as minority languages, which coexist with majority languages (Neidle et al., 2000) and which are the native languages for many deaf people. Provision of information access and services in signed languages is as important as in other minority languages. Such provision, however, introduces theoretical and technical challenges. The use of a sign language gesture notation to drive virtual humans (avatars) for presenting signing has been investigated (Kennaway, 2001).

Further possible extensions to the work could involve trying t o specify a lexicon so that the generative process ends up with a structure with words as leaves, and one could also attempt to apply the rules in reverse, i.e. To start with a string of lords and produce a structural description. Both problems are, of course, very difficult ones.
In the first part of this paper, we present our tool: a shallow? parser compiler. In a second part, we present output samples as well as several evaluations for French and for English,where the tool has been used to develop both an NP? chunker and a richer shallow? parser. We also explain why our approach is more tolerant to POS? tagging errors. Finally, we discuss some other practical uses which are made of this shallow? parser compiler.
742.1 Evaluating Focus-Based Approaches Sidner's algorithmic account, although not exhaustively specified, has lead to the implementation of focus-based approaches to anaphora resolution in several systems, e.g. PIE (Lin, 1995). However, evaluation of the approach as mainly consisted of manual analyses of small sets of problematic cases mentioned in the literature. Precise evaluation over sizable corpora of real-world texts has only recently become possible, through the resources provided as part of the MUC evaluations.
It uses the rules of the grammar in a form where the metarules have been applied, but the permutations implied by the LP rules have not been explicitly expanded. This means that we have fewer rules to worry about, but slightly more work to do each time we apply one (since we have to check that we are applying it in a way allowed by the LP rules). The extra work is minimised by using the LP rules, at the time when the grammar is first read in, to index ID rules by their possible legal initial substructures. This prevents the parser trying out completely pointless rules.

For the relations, fire units stand for characteristics of the relation itself Note that this differs from most other approaches in treating each role or relation as a distributed pattern. This has several virtues. For one thing, it immediately eliminates the problem of specifying a small set of case roles, in the face of the fact that there seem to he a very large number of very subtle differences between roles that are in many ways very similar. Further, the use of distributed representations allows us to capture both the similarities and differences among case roles. The idea has been proposed on independent linguistic grounds, as well.

The questions, "what class does a verb belong to?", "what are the relative frequencies of the different patterns it occurs in?", and "is this pattern grammatical?' are intimately connected. Alternation behaviour is a major source of evidence as to how a verb should be classified, and grammaticality judgements are premised upon the patterns a competent speaker has frequently encountered in their experience of the language. The further development of computational lexical semantics of the kind described in this paper requires foundational work on the relation of corpus-based statistical findings to formal knowledge representation.

Examples of such tasks include text tagging and indications and warnings. In a text tagging task, information of a particular generic type is identified, such as persons, companies, or dates. These types generally occur in a wide range of domains. The information is identified in the Preparsing module and, for some types, must be processed by the Coreference Resolution module to eliminate multiple references. The output of such a system might be used, for example, to create indexes to documents for later information retrieval applications. Another example might be the display of the original text directly to an analyst, with relevant types of information marked or highlighted in some way.

Not only does a speaker plan for a hearer to identify the referent of a description, but he often indicates his intention that the hearer do so. According to Searle, one possible way to do this is to use a definite determiner. Of course, not all definite NP's are used to refer: for example, in the sentence "the last piece is the nozzle', the referent of the first NP is intended to be identified, whereas the referent of the second NP is not. The attributive use of definite noun phrases \[6\] is a case in which the speaker has no intention that the hearer identify a referent. Yet other nonanaphoric uses of definite noun phrases include labeling an object, correcting a referential miscommunication, having the hearer wait while the speaker identifies the referent, etc. '~ To respond appropriately, a hearer decides when identification is the act he is supposed to perform on a description, what part this act " will play in the speaker's and hearer's plan, and how and when to perform the act. If perceptually identifying a referent is represented as an action in the speaker's plan, hearers can reason about it just as any other act, thereby allowing them to infer the speaker's intentions behind indirect identification requests.
