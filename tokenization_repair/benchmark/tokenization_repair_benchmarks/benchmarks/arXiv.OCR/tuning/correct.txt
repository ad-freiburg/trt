Let G be a connected (p, q)-graph. In this section, we describe a partially ordered set PG, called the graphicahedron, and show in particular that PG is an abstract polytope of rank q. The i-faces of PG are given by the connected components of the Cayley graphs of the form G(H), where H is a spanning subgraph of G with i edges.

As shown in WCF, the KS technique recovers the mass distribution in clusters extremely well when the lensing is weak i.e. when the bending angle varies slowly with position. Our CCD simulations in that pa-per demonstrated that observational complications such as see-ing and noise act to diminish the reconstructed surface density. However, we showed that it was possible to correct fully for this diminution and proposed a method to estimate a multiplicative compensation factor, f.

However, as a complex branch-point describes a pole hidden in a two-body channel of a [hreebody intermediate state, SAID is described by two poles as well.

If X is a finite set of positive integers, then a decreasing plane tree on X is a rooted plane tree with vertex set X in which each nonroot vertex is smaller than its parent. Decreasing plane trees play a significant role in computer science. In that field, one is often interested in listing the vertices of the tree in some meaningful order. A scheme by which one f~?atd- these vertices is a tree traversal. Two of the most common tree traversals are known as postorder and preorder; both are defined recursively.

The electronic band structures near the Fermi level for a (10,0) nanotube adsorbed with NH3 and NO2 are presented in Fig.4 and compared with that of pure nanotube. We find the band structures for ei-ther valence or conduction bands of carbon nanotube are not significantly changed upon the molecule adsorption. However, the degeneracies of the energy bands in SWNT are removed by the molecule-tube interaction. The band splitting cause by NO2 is more pronounced than that by NH3. This is consistent with the larger charge transfer and the higher adsorption en-ergy (Table II).

Introduction
The classification of isometries by conjugacy classes is too fine, and in all three cases there are infinitely many conjugacy classes. Moreover, classes having the same normal form structure but differing only in the sets of eigenvalues have the same geometric behav-ior. A more convenient classification is given by the orbit type.
During the learning phase, each document is preprocessed. The result is mapped onto a vector of the same length as the relevancy vector. For every position in the relevancy vector, it is determined whether the corresponding result has been found. In that case, the value of the result vector element is 1, otherwise it is 0.

Here u(t) is the Heaviside unit step function. The coefficient σ0 is proportional to the peak value of the gain set by the pumping level and the resulting population inversion. Such model assumes that the optical gain medium is homogeneously broadened wherein the atoms of the gain medium are indistinguishable and have the same atontic tranition frequency, ω0. A natural variation of the QD sizes will cause the broadening of the exciton line of the QDs. Time constant τ permits to include the relaxation processes in a phenomenological manner (decay rate is 1/τ) and shows that any phase coherence introduced into the system of atoms by the action of an electric field will be lost in a time interval τ once the electric field is turned off.

To explain exactly what these protocols achieve, it is? helpful to use our framework to model the process by which Alice herself learns the bit value b to which she will commit. In practice, this bit b might be the result of a computation that Alice carries onat or a fact about nature that she learns, or even a thought (perhaps a prediction based on intuition) that pops into her mind. These processes take place in space and time, and so one might begin by model-ling them by an kintexaction with an oracle that supplies Alice with the value b at some definite point P in space-time.

We derived ionic abundances using IR fine-structure emission lines where possible, which have the advantages of high emissivity relative to optical lines, and in-sensitivity to uncertainties in the derived Te and extinction. Combined with the superior calibration of the space-based IR data compared to ground-based data, the derived ionic abundances have substantially lower uncertainty. The IR emission lines are important for deriving ionic abundances for several ions that are not observable in the op-tical. They also provide an important check of the ionic abundances derived from the optical data for ions in common, where the agreement is very good except for Ne+2. We were able to validate elemental abundances derived from the combination of optical emission lines and traditional ICFs with those derived from a combination of optical and IR lines (or limits thereto). We found excellent agreement for O, S, and Ar; the poor agreement for Ne is due to a consistent offset in the Ne+2 abundance, which may point to a problem with the supporting atomic data. In the end, our data have significantly improved the accuracy of the elemental abundances for, Ne and S in the target nebulae, with considerable improvement in the abundances of O and Ar as well, as com-pared to those in the literature.
In conclusion, we study refraction phenomena on the junction between the two TI surfaces with different velocities. The result-ing reflectance and transmittance reflect the backscattering-free nature of the surface states of TIs. When the velocities of the TI surface states for the two TIs have ~different signs, we show that the gapless states appear on the interface. The existence of the gapless states is shown by using the mirror Chern number, and thus is topologically protected by the mirror symmetry.

The boundary conditions of the semi-infinite lab (x > 0) with an infinite potential barrier at x = 0 are as follows. For Schrodinger equation, the boundary condition is lim x → 0ψsch = 0, which comes from the fact that the Schrodinger equation is second order in x, so ψsch must be continuous at? x = 0. The same is true for Klein-Gordon equation, so the same boundary condition exists:

The sur-vey budget is considered low-cost compared to the existing or planned all-sky surveys that focus on deeper limiting mag-nitude, or space-based observatories, which are up to two orders of magnitude more expensive. In contrast to existing or \pl~ned eep surveys with narrower fields of view, our survey will cover entire visible night sky few times per night. In spite of its lower limiting magnitude, large pixels would decrease the effects of trailing loss for fast moving targets. Thus, ADAM-WFS will detect more fast mov-ing objects than any survey equipped with telescopes of similar size.

HVCs may either sweep up material on their way through the halo or they may loose gas which is stripped off from the outer cloud boundaries due to drag forces. Probably, both effects occur at the same time, however we assume that on the average more material is swept up by the HVCs than lost. The amount of mat,ter which a HVC is sweeping up is highly uncertain. We estimate that on the average HVCs accumulate 50% of the gas which is passed by. Such a rate seems to be reasonable because IVCs have significantly higher column densities than HVCs. In addition at such a rate we obtain in our model calculations IVC velocities which are close to the observed ones. As a consequence of gas enrichment, in our model the gas-to-dust ratio as well as the metalicity of HVCs and IVCs is modified by the swept-up material.

Regarding S3 as a Hopf fibration of S1 over S2, one SU(2) ⊂ SO(4) acts as ropatios on the S2 (together with the induced action on the fiber), while the other contains a U(1) subgroup of the translations along the S1 fiber. In the flat space limit, the diagonal SU(2) becomes the SO(3) rotation group that fixes a given point.

Studies based on other gala-xy sam-ples (e.g. Carter et al. 2001) also came to a similar conclusion, but the SDSS results are stronger, being based on a much larger number of objects, a clear selection function, high resolution spectra and elaborate subtraction of stellar features.

Below we outline the most important aspects of the model.
We solve the self-consistent equation for large dis-crete 512 × 512 momentum points in the first Brillouin zone. We confirmed that the results of 512 × 512 practically coincide with those of 256 × 256, within the width of the lines in our figures of DOS and Tc. Thus, practic.ally, the system size 512 × 512 can be regarded as being within the thermodynamic limit at the present temperature. We interpolate the obtained self-energy linearly in the momentum space so that the first Brillouin zone has 4096 × 4096 points for the calculation of DOS.

It is well known the biasing effect in galaxy formation, i. e., the relative perturbations in the galaxy field and the mittev field, on a t)ointby?poln ba-sis, are not equal:

As mentioned at this Seminar, the phenomenon of drifting subpulses appears to be quite general; and its usual explanation by E x B-drifting sparks around polar caps may be in mild conflict with their strong observed winds. How about oscillating magnetospheres? Here is a sketchy estimate of their os-cillation frequency: it equals their rotation frequency, at least approximately, hence can be easily excited at resonance. The tiny inertia of the outgoing pulsar wind modulates this resonance slightly. At the same time, oscillating magnetospheres can explain the so far ill-understood QPO phenomenon of the accreting binary X-ray sources, both neutron-star and BHC binaries.

Motivated by this expert strategy, here we lever-age dataset size as an additional degree of freedom enriching the representation of the optimization problem. We treat the dataset size s as an addi-tional input to the blackbox function, and allow the optimizer to actively choose it at each function evaluation. This allows Bayesian optimization to mimic and improve upon human experts when exploring the hyperparameter space. Since s is not a hyperparameter itself, though, the goal of optimization relrlains good performance on the full dataset, i.e. for the maximal value of s.

As such from the initial sample of 176 transiting exoplanets we remove the KOI-703 system, the latest tranch6 of" WASP systems (20, 42, 47, 49 and 52 through 70) and WASP-36b as many of the characteristics of the hosts and systems are not yet well defined. We remove GJ1214b and GJ436b as these have M type host stars and WASP-33b as this has an A type host, and thus fall outside the scope of this study. HAT-P-31b, Kepler-5b, 6b, 15b, OGLE-TR-182b, SWEEPS-04b, 11b, TrES-5b, WASP-35b and 48b are removed as the spectral type of the host star is not well defined.

Conclusions. In this paper we have analyzed the appearing of a superconducting phase of MoS2 at high carrier concentrations and for strong screening of the long range Coulomb potential. The significant short range repulsion between carriers at the conduction band allows for a superconducting phase induced by the electron-electron interaction, where the gap acquires opposite signs in the two inequivalent pockets of the conduction band. This superconducting state, similar to that found in the cuprate and pnictide superconductors, is expected to show interesting topological features, such as Andreev states at edges and grain boundaries.
Consequently, the radial wave functions reads as

Preliminaries
We c~puted ~trellar evolutionary models that take into account the combined effects of rota-tion and of tidal forces due to a companion star, obtaining values of the internal structure con-stants for low-mass, pre-MS stars. Our approximation for binary model calculations (with effects of tidal forces) do not include the pseudo-potential ccntxifugal tefms arising from the orbital motion of the components around the center of mass of the ,ys(em. Fnr all se?ts of models, namely standard, binary, rotating and rotating binary models, we tabulated the internal structure constants and the gyration radii for ZAMS models and their time evolution. Distorted models result in more mass-concentrated stars and produce larger gyration radii at the ZAMS than standard ones.
We recall that y = N1/u for some fixed constant u. Thus provided τ ≥ ku we have

Why not dispense with unstratified models and go straight to the more realistic, stratified case? First, the unstratified models are numerically less demanding. The stratified boxes include low density regions that require \small timesteps because of the Courant condition in a magnetized fluid. Stratified boxes a1so assign only a fraction of the zones to the turbulent center of the disk; the rest are as-signed to the nearly force-free disk atmosphere. Se-cond, the unstratified boxes allow the study of the nonlinear development of the Balbus-Hawley instability independent of buoyancy effects. A final, post hoc justification is that stratification is not yet measured to have a significant effect on the outcome. This may, however, not be true in future large, highly resolved experiments.

The rigorous decomposition of structural components in galaxies is critical to our understanding of their formation and evolution.

The pi'eent us\ork proposes a new numerical strategy for multi-scale streamer simulations. It is based on an adaptive second order time integration strategy that allows to discriminate time scales-related features of the phenomena, given a required level of accuracy of computations. Compared with a standard procedure for which accuracy is guaranteed by considering time steps of the order of the fastest scale, the control error ap-proach implies on the one hand, an effective accurate resolution independent of the fastest physical time scale, and on the other hand, an important improvement of computational efficiency whenever the required time steps go beyond stan-dard stability constraints. The latter is a direct consequence of the self-adaptive time step strategy for the resolution of the drift-diffusion equations which considers splitting time steps not limited by stabil-ity constraints for reaction, diffusion and convection phenomena. So far, the global decoupling time steps are limited by the dielectric relaxation stability con-straint but with a second order accuracy. Nevertheless, we have also demonstrated that the decoupling time steps are rather chosen based on an accuracy criterion. Besides, if a technique such as a semi-implicit approach is implemented, the same ideas of the proposed adaptive strategy remain valid.

In this section, we generalize our holographic model to the case where the scalar field is charged under the gauge field in the bulk. As we discussed in the introduction, this implies that the dual field theory includes some low-dimension gauge-invariant operator with charge, so the charge in this caTse is more naturally thought of as some isospin-type charge (since the smallest gauge-invariant operators carrying baryon charge have dimensions of order N).
It is useful to summarize the experimental sensitivities given above in a time-ordered, rather than technique-ordered, manner. We skip here those options with underdeveloped estimates.

This result follows by supersymmetry; it will be also derived by traditional combinatorial arguments later on (see Appendix). It is perhaps amusing that the ob-vious algebraic fact that odd n has only odd divisors while even n admits both (i.e. even and odd) divisors, directly corresponds to the existence of the necklaces allowed and forbidden by the Pauli principle!

Our results are consistent with variations that stem from temperature changes in the AD, where the B- and V-bands are placed in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the thermal emission.

Cases 3a, 3b, and 3c: For case 3a, the dominant bounds are the SIMO cut-set bounds, and thus, as discussed for the inactive cases, the optimal policy is water-filling for each user such tliat a maximum of 4 users can transmit simultaneously. On the other hand for case 3b, the dominant bounds are the cooperative bounds at the destina-tion and the optimal policy for each user is an opportunistic water-filling solution. Finally, for case 3c, as one would expect, the optimal policies are no longer water-filling. In all cases, the optimal relay policy is a water-filling solution.
Conclusion. For 44Ti, combining a few SU(3) irreps with SM(2) configurations increases the model space only by a small (≈2.3%) amount but results in better overall results: a lower ground-state energy, the correct spectral structure (particularly the position of K=2 + band head), and wave functions with a larger overlap with the exact results. The oblique-bases SM(2)+(12,0)&(10,1) results for 44Ti (≈50%) yields results that are comparable with the SM(3) results (≈84%). In short, the oblique-basis scheme works well for 44Ti, only in this case, in contrast with the previous results for 24Mg where SU(3) was found to be dominant and SSM recessive, in the lower pf-shell SSM is dominant and SU(3) recessive.

Therefore, alternatives to the compressible Euler equations are frequently used in the low-Mach-number regime. Since sound waves are usually not of interest in the situations fu te modeled, it is common practice to start out from the incompressible version of the equations. Although this is a useful strat-egy for terrestrial systems, it was found to be to be inadequate to describe of many astrophysical processes. While the gravity source term can be included in the velocity equation, thermal effects of expansion or contraction are not accounted for. This makes the incompressible equations unsuitable for a variety of situations, inclt,s.ig simulat?il:s of stellar convection or thermonuclear burning.

In physics, eigenvalue problem is associated with many important practical applications. To name a few, in the classical mechanics, small oscillations of a system about the equilibrium is treated as superpo-sition of normal modes via the characteristic equation for the frequencies; in quantum theory, the atomic spectra can be obtained by solving the time-independent Schrodinger equation; in general relativity, the stability of a black hole metric is studied by investigating the temporal evolution of small perturbations known as quasinormal modes. All of the above examples are closely related to the eigenvalue problem. However, owing to the mathematical difficulties, one usually has to resort to numerical approaches, and therefore, various methods were proposed.

We applied the generalized number coherent states theory to study the prob-lem of a charged particle in the Landau and symmetric gauge. We showed that for the Landau gauge, the eigenfunctions for the Landau level states can be represented in terms of the harmonic oscillator coherent states. For the symmetric gauge we study the eigenfunctions of this problem in cylindrical coordinates and we constructed the SU(1, 1) Perelomov number coherent states in a closed way. We show that under a contraction of the SU(1, 1) group, the 'er?loInot rtumb,er coherent states are reduced to the number coherent states of the harmonic oscillator, related to the Heisenberg-Weyl group.

The layout of the remainder of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we show how Yukawa textures may be generated from a broken U(1)X gauged family symmetry where the desired operators are generated from the effective field theory beneath the string scale via spaghetti diagrams. In section 3 we discuss a two-loop analysis of string gauge unification, where the extra states are consistent with the requirements of the previous sec-tion. In sec-tion 4 we give a general discussion of the infra-red fixed point nature of such models, then discuss two semi-realistic examples. Section 5 concludes the paper. Appendix 1 sum-marises the running of the gauge couplings to two loops in models with matter additional to the MSSM, appendix 2 lists the wave-function renormalisations for the general model discussed in section 4, appendix 3 details the infra-red fixed point of the Higgs mixing model, and appendix 4 details the infra-red fixed point of a quark-line mixing model.
We think that these results are ratlier geeral and apply to many more complex Hamiltonians h?a,, the naive pairing one considered here. Since the GCM Ansatz includes explicitly fluctuations in the wave function it is very appropriate to deal with finite systems where phase transitions may take place. The method, contrary to other approxima-tions, ap-plies equally well to systems with very few or very large particle number. On the o.i.P hud ,tlf(; GCM Ansatz is very versatile to be adapted to other physical situations by considering additional coordinates to the ones discussed in this work.

However complex a theory of homogeneous crystal nucleation in droplets may beu the presence of for-eign particle~, serving as nucleating centers, makes the crystal nucleation pheno?menon (and hence its theory) even more involved. Numerous aspects of heterogeneous crystal nucleation still remain obscure. One of most intriguing problems in this field remains the strong enhancement of heterogeneous crystallization in the contact mode compared to the immersion one. It has been observed that the same nucleating center initiates the crystallization of a supercooled droplet at a higher temperature in the contact mode (with the foreign par-ticle just in contact with the droplet surface) compared to the immersion mode (particle immersed in the droplet).2 Many heterogeneous cen\ters have different nucleation thresholds when they act in contact or immersion modes, indicating that the mechanisms may be actually differ-ent for the different modes. Underlying phys-ical reasons for this enhancement have remained largely unclear, but the phenomenon of surface-stimulated (homogeneous) crystal nucleation had strongly suggested that the droplet surface could enhance heterogeneous nucleation in a way similar to the enhancement of the homogeneous process.

We did notice that the optimal friction values which we obtained from fitting the two simulations increased slightly with temperature, an effect which was more signifi-cant for adsorbates with a higher mass. One possible interpretation of this observation is that the need to increase the friction parameter of the Langevin simulation at higher temperatures is an indication of a discrepancy between the two numerical approaches (i.e. we are compensating for fundamental differences between the two simulations by ajustlng the fit parameter). Another inte.rpretatio. is that the frictional cou-pling rate is increasing with temperature in the MD simulation and that the comparison with the Langevin simulation (which produces an optimal friction paameter) is siimply revealing this fact. We used the quasi-elastic base width as a method to estimate the frictional coupling from the dephasing rate of the motion within the adsorption site and extract effective friction values from the MD data. Our results show that the effective friction val-ues extracted using this method, are in Soul(se\ proximity to those used to fit the Langevin simulation. Furthermore, the effective friction values also show an increase with temperature supporting the second interpretation mentioned above, i.e the frictional coupling in-creases with temperature in the MD simulation and the need to adjust the friction parameter of the Langevin simulation to fit the two simulations does not indicate a discrepancy between the two numerical approaches.

Although the eukariotic code (EC) seems to be a universal genetic code, it appears in some way as an advanced form of the vertebral mitochondrial code (VMC). Indeed there is very few difference between the two codes. The codons in the VMC are organized into 2 sextets, 6 quadruplets and 14 doublets. When evolving from the VMC to the EC, one doublet and one quartet merge together to form a sextet while two other doublets split into four singlets, two of them gluing with existing doublets to form two triplets. The final result for the EC is 3 sextets, 5 quadruplets, 10 doublets, 2 triplets and \2 singlets. Hence, ',i appears natural to start to calculate R for the vertebral mitochondrial code.

Our study also tries to shed some light on the importance of thermal conduction and radiative loss effects when we study the ejection of a flux rope. While, there is no doubt that thermal condution, radiative losses, and ohmic heating are all physical processes actually ts~ing place in the solar corona, the question i? whether they are effective during a flux rope ejection or CME. A common drawback of the use of thermal conduction is that it results in greater computational times. A secondary effect of this is that with the increased number of timesteps needed to span a given physical time, there are larger roundoff errors with an increase of the effect of numerical diffusion. Therefore, it is worthwhile to question whether the use of these specific non-ideal terms is useful de-pending on the purpose of the investigation.

The duality rotation which takes a single center solution to an STU form is not powerful enough for a generic 1/8 BPS sotut}on with multiple centers: such a rotation is clearly not enough to rotate every center to STU form. For solutions generated via quaternionic magic supergravity, it would be interesting to work out which is the minimal N = 2 truncation that admits generic cases with two, three, four etc... centers, just as STU supergravity is minimal truncation of N = 8 which describes all single center solutions.
We argue that the discussion presented here can be also applied to higher-dimensional operators where only Higgs doublets are added. In order to preserve gauge invariance in the NSI, it is necessary to include the effects of the internal Goldstone loops. In order to avoid specifying the underlying theory, we must therefore compute the loop diagrams of the effective the-ory in the unitary gauge, where the Goldstone propagai;o vanish.

Abstract Several, apparently distinct, formalisms exist in the literature for predicting the clus-tering of dark matter halos. It has been noticed on a case-by-case basis that the predictions of these different methods agree in specific examples, but there is no gen-eral proof that they are equivalent. In this paper, we give a simple proof of the mathematical equivalence of barrier crossing, peak-background split, and local biasing.

The success of this approach lies in the fact that it can rapidly distinguish between ordered and chaotic mo-tion in Hamiltonian flows and symplectic mappings of any dimensionality. Since the SALI decays exponentially to zero in the case of chaotic orbits (and oscillates quasiperiodically around non-zero values in ordered regions), it bypasses the slow and often irregular convergence properties of the computation of Lyapunov exponents and thus provides quickly a definite characterization of each orbit.

We have come to conclusion that the most probable physical driving force of destruction of the blue-green beads is the strain induced by the crystalline mi-croinclusions precipitated during and/or after the bead manufacturing and by their agglomerates which gives rise to internal microcracks and extended impurity atmospheres; the latter arise due to strain-stimulated difnusion of some components of glass, such as potassium, copper and antimony, ino the domains with high density of the precipitated clusters denuding the rest volume of the beads and introducing chemical inhomogeneity into the glass. Bead granulation at the last phase of corrosion seems to result from this inhomogeneity. The pre-cipitates responsible for the internal strain in the glass presumably consist of some chemical compound of antimony.

It is worth making a few remarks about the advantages of performin.H this sort of analysis in Fourier space rather than via high-order correlation functions in real space. The main advantage, which is shared by the power spectrnm,i is that the estimates of the correlation functions in Fourier space can be made uncorrelated (or at least their correla-tion properties can be readily calculated), with enormous benefits for estimation of parameters and error bars. The second ad-vantage is that the real-space determinations of high-order correlations are really only known well in the non-linear regime, where perturbation theory may not apply. In Fourier space, there is a clear separation of scales where perturbation theory works and breaks down.

Event shapes provide a rich ground for testing the perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics of QCD. As they are in general less inclusive than total cross-sections, event shapes receive larger nonperturbative contributions to their observed values, but are still sufficiently inclusive to allow for a controlled expansion in these power corrections. Thus we may hope both to ob-serve these effects easily in experiment and also to describe them theoretically.

A third useful aspect of our method is that, given a target accuracy of the integration, it is trivial to reweight the channels so that those whose contributions to the total result is small (large) are evaluated with a smaller (greater) number of Monte Carlo points. One simply introduces th\ analogues of the αi as in a standard multi-channel method, defining them as αi = Ii/I. This realizes in practice the desirable property that the computational time spent on a single channel should be proportional to its relevance to the final result.

We hope that this summary of our experiences with idas and the lessons we have learned from it will be beneficial for other researchers who wish to build technical-documentation generation systems.

One of the interesting features of the Kazant-sev model is that for random flows the only thing that matters for the onset of dynamo action is the roughness exponent of the spectrum in the neighbourhood of the dissi-pative scale. Therefore, within this framework, features associated with high-order moments, or large-scale bound-ary conditions do not matter. Thus trOms t~,e point of view of dynamo onset a velocity derived from solving the Navier-Stokes equations, with random forcing should yield qualitatively similar results nLso synthesised random velocity with the same spectrum. So far this seems to be consistent with the results of numerical simulations. However, for flows with a substantial non-random component, outside of the range of validity of the Kazantsev model it may be that characteristics other than the spectral slope of the velocity do play a key role in determining dynamo onset, ond it is this possibility that we address in the next sec-tion. The results of the next section should therefore act as a caveat when considering the applicability of the results of this section.

Observing the actions of others is a univer-sal simple mechanism that allows us to handle imperfect information in our complex social environ-ment to make difficult decisions. We can protect ourselves from the tyranny of fashions by associating into tightly knit communities or we may try to set trends by influencing the choices of others through our social connections. Here I showed that these successful individual strategies lead to stable social arrangements, which coincide with some of the most notable observed structures of social networks. Trend dynamics breaks the degeneracy of our individual choices and leads to the spontaneous formation of coUeetive movements. Whenever concerted social action is more pro-ductive than the sum of individual efforts social hubs may become the social mechanism that facilitates the creation of consensus most promptly and predictably.

In many ways, computational astrophysics lies intermediate between observations and theory. Simulations generally cover a wider range of physical phenomena than observations with individnal telescopes, whereas purely theoretical studies are often tailored to solving sets of linearized differential equations. As soon as these equations show emergent behavior in which the mutual coupling of non-linear processes result in complex behavior, the computer provides an enormous resource for addressing these problems. Furthermore simulations can support observational astronomy by mimicking ob-servations and aiding their interpretation by enabling param-eter-space studies. They can elucidate the often complex consequences of even simple physi-cal lhocries, like the non-linear behavior of many-body gravitational systems. But in order (.o dcepeJ,, onrA knowledge of the physics, extensive computer simulations require large programming efforts and a thorough fundamental understanding of many aspects of the underlying theory.

Measurement and Probabilistic Processes
It is standard practice to compare galaxy photometry with stellar population models that vary over some range of parameter space. Uncertainties on the stellar population parameters (e.g., mass, age, extinc-tion, star-formation history, met~lliciunty) are either derived through Monte Carlo methods or by marginalizing over some probability distribution function. Both of these methods assume a prior that the models represent the data. In the sections that follow we compare 'l)hehe physical properties derived using broad-band photometry alone, and then including the medium-band photometry. For illustrative purpose, we plot the relevant figures either for the brightest (zF13965) or the 2nd brightest (zF25035) LBG (whichever yields extreme values) but tabulate the derived properties for the two brightest galaxies in Table 2-3.

It is important to note that the latter process directly affo.cts the former since the strength of tidal coupling between the disk and the perturber leading to migration depends on the spatial distribution of the disk surface density (Ward 1997).

In section 5 we show that the lifted metric and dilaton/axion fields completely fixes the supersymmetric Janus solution with SU(3) isometry in type IIB supergravity.

Ol)t.ical Follow-up Observations
Calculation of hadron matrix elements of phenomenological interest represents an ine'vitable application of lattice QCD. In the past decade much ef-forts have been devoted for the calculation of three- and four-quark hadron matrix elements relevant to the proton decay amplitude and the weak interaction ones using the Wilson and the Kogut-Susskind(KS) quark actions. However, the satisfac-torily precise measurement of the matrix elements has not been achieved so far because of the inherent defects in these quark actions: the exi)lic.it chiral symmetry breaking in the Wilson quark action causes the non-trivial operator mixing be-tween different chiralities and for the KS quark it is hard to treat the heavy-light cases due to the flavor symmetry breaking.

However, we note that the values of α and β lead to an optimal width W2/h = 12.78 in Eq.(3), which is smaller than prediction from stress fields, and than observed in experiments. The discrepancy in the theoretical results is due to an approximation in the computation of the elastic energy released along the crack path. We have indeed assumed a released elastic energy propor-tional to the length of the path γhs, independently frul the curvature of the path. The value of prefactor γ was actually obtained by numerical computation of a straight cut where the stress field is invariant along the crack line (plane stfain). This is not true if the path is curved, leading to a three-dimensional stress field. We give here an estimate of this effect, and show that it tends to increase the equilibrium width W2 by a significant amount, reconciling both theoretical approaches.

Introduction
In this paper, then, we formulate a complee path integral bosonization procedure for any fermionic theory in two dimensions, based on Jacobians of chiral rotations. It is a generalization of the bosonization procedure in the sense of Andrianov and can be used also for fermionic models with mass-terms. That is, fermions coupled to Abelian or non-Abelian V, A, S and P sources can be bosonized with this procedure. The bosonization is complete in the sense that a tensor is equivalent to a scalar in two dimensions.

The distance between trees will quan-tify their difference, however, it is not standardized relative to the norms of the functions. Correlation is an alternative quantification of the similarity between trees which is on a standardized scale between -1 and 1.

The overall shapes of the envelopes affected by gravitational focusing vary from senmool to model, depending on the parameters of the binary. For high mass, close-in com-panions, the wind is highly concentrated towards the orbital plane, and for lower mass, more distant companions the flow is more spherically symmetric. At large distances from the star system where the wind is in steady state at the terminal velocity, the latitude variation of the density is frozen into the flow.
As a reminder, due to the affine relation between pressure and time, the differ-ence in time, between the time at which the mouth pressure crosses the static threshold and the moment the oscillations actually start can be mapped 1,o a pressure difference.

These modelling approaches have in common a high-(limensional parameter space. Although these parameters can be identified from exper-iments, the resulting model is often too complex to provide insight in the govern-ing mechanisms. Moreover, to compute, for instance, the settling properties of the ensemble of interacting flocs in the clarifier, one has to combine a CFD with a PBM approach, which leads to even more intricate models.

Transiting exoplanets have provided an unprecedented opportunity to directly measure physical parameters of the planet and host star, such as mass and radius. The lightcurve shape of a transit (where the planet passes in front of the star as viewed from the Earth) is primarily determined by the planet-to-star radius ratio, impact parameter, and stellar limb darkening. Thus, an accurate treatment of limb darkening is critical when deriving planetary radii and transmission spectra from transit data.

In ref. 14, the effective medium theory is used to calculate the effective dielectric constant of the zeolite-SWNT composite by taking into account the zeolite effects. They thought that the van der Waals interaction between nanotube and zeolite is very weak, as well as the influence of the Z,ec\]discussi,tcnd- on the electronic structure of the nanotube. Therefore, they in fact neglected this interaction, and treated the zeolite-nanotube composite as a homogeneous material with an effective dielectric constant. However, our work really takes into account the interaction between the AFI and (5,0) tubes by the first-principles calculation, and we find that above approximation is justified in the long-wavelength limit, and in general, the AFI has real effect on the absorption spectra.

CCZ-inequivalence and computational results
These difficulties have their origin in a too rapid identification of uniformly accelerated reference frames with their Rindler representation. This particular representation of accelerated frames favors a criterion of rigidity ipl the transformation of solid bodies. A consequence of this choice is that Maxwell equations are modified in the change of reference frame. The Unruh effect essentially tells us that the ~efnifaliion of vacuum is also altered in a Rindler transformation and that the accelerated vacuum obtained after the transformation appears as a thermal field. Bsut the Rindler representation of accelerated reference frames is not the only possible one. In fact an infinite number of representations exist when one only imposes the condition that a given point with uniform acceleration is brought to rest. Furthermore, the theory of general relativity does not provide any manner to privilegiate one particular representation of accelerated frames since it convincingly argues that physical results cannot depend on the choice of a particular map of space-time.

The study of real-time evolution of many-body quantum systems driven out of equilibrium is a subject of intense current interest, partly motivated by remarkable experimental advances in the control of non-equilibrium conditions, both in cold atomic systems and solid-state setups. As a result of this interest, many systems and phenomena in condensed matter physics are being re-examined in non-equilibrium situations. Quantum impurity problems have long been a central paradigm in the study of correlated quantum matter. Impurity models have contributed to influential physical ideas, such as the Kondo model to the development of the renormalization group and the Caldeira-Legget model .fo the- study of decoherence. Quantum impurity models continue today to be a source of new physical insights, and appear in a variety of contexts.
The first term in the equation for G < represents a boundary term, which is of-ten omitted in discussions of a stationary situation, since it only affects the transient behavior.

This is consistent with results obtained for other magnetic Ap/Bp stars by Wade et al.

We have also presented similarly accurate predictions of the inverse Compton optical depth for the near-future ACBAR experiment. While somewhat less robust than the 5.5-meter predictions due to the small angular scales this telescope samples, these predictions should be more than sufficient for real-world applications.

The usage of O-C diagram in variables depends on the maximum value points of the light curves we observed, but these points are always un-stable when the object is a dou-ble-mode or multi-mode pulsator. All the modes couptng together and the maximum points are the comprehensive effects of them all. Of cours, we can use the other methods to analyse the period change of the pulsator for example the Fourier analysis for each data set. But in most cases, these methods need a lot of high quality data, which is always difficult to obtain. Furthermore, in the historical observational data of most variables, the maximum value points are the most credible and always the only credible parts. We should make full use of the data. As a result, we give out some criteria to decide whether the classical O-C diagram can be used to these pulsators.

In the case s = 0 we have two free theories, both on an infinitely large configuration space (understood in the variable x).

Comparing results obtained in different time configurations of the electric field, we estimate the role of switching on and off effects in the vacuum instability.

This result is a generalization of the standard procedure leading to the generating function for the mo-ments of discrete counts in cells (e.g. Fry 1985).

Figure 2 shows the temporal behaviour of the amplitude X1 of the new set of rolls as well as the amplitude X2 of the old set of rolls. While X1 oscillates with zero mean, X2 oscillates around a finite value. The time period of X1 is always double of that of X2. In fact all the modes (X1, Y1, S, T) that develop at r > ro oscillate with same period and with zero mean. The periods of Y2 and Z are the same as that of X2. The frequency f = 1/T of oscillation of X2 at the onset of oscillatory instability increases v;tth increasing Prandtl number (see Fig. 3).

Feasibility
Some examples
To con-nect to experimental results, we need to keep two caveats in mind. First, one does not measure in-medium dilepton emission of heavy quarkonium in experiment but instead the decay of vacuum states long after the QGP has ceased to exist. Therefore comparing the in-medium spectra directly to nlea,surud spectra is not admissible. On the other hand our assumption of full kinetic equilibration is, if at all, only applicable to charmonium at low pT and mid-rapidity. Therefore in the following we con-centrate on the lighter of the two flavors.

There is a potential source of disagreement betwcen comiraring I(0) when different laws are used in the stellar model LD and transit-fit LD. In our model calculations, the peroe&a-l trend is to decrease I(0) when adopting a higher order law to describe the intensity. Higher order laws are increasingly sensitive to the shape of the falling intensity at th\e limb, thus reducing the fit value of I(0). However, we believe this to be a second order effect which should not seriously affect ?tghase results, especially as several of the CoRot LDCs are poorly constrained and are not sensi-tive to higher order terms.
In the following section, we provide an argument that, near the insulating phase transition (for example, at sufficiently low doping), the d-wave pairing term present in the bare level is qualitatively sufficient to capture the essence of superconducting fluctuations. It is furthe sul)ported by exact diagonalization that the assumption of the single-site DMFT formalism is in fact valid even away from the phase transition point as long as the bare d-wave pairing amplitude l.~ appropriately chosen.

The ongoing direct searches for dark matter as well as for solar axions are suggestive to ask whether the same detection principles are at work behind certain astrophysical observations, whose origin remains enigmatic. Nature might have implemented already a kind of fine tuning, which we may or may not be able to copy on Earth. This kind of ?iu"tt?i'c'e1.\ signatures for dark matter constituents might be strong at the end, if, for example, the same exotic process can explain, in a consistent way, more celestial phenomena. This work refers to astrophysical observations of unknown originned. which can be explained with the involvement of axions or other particles with similar properties, which we call generically as axion(-like).
The ability to reproduce the kink by the RMF theory and the failure of the present Skures",rrgumeme interactions not to be able to do so, raises some important questions. The shell effects that are inherent in the structure of nuclei over the periodic table are described differently by vari-ous theories. The kink in the empirical data on the charge radii of Pb isotopes is one of the aspects which has remained hitherto unsolved. Presently, the RMF theory succeeds in accommodating these shell effects which run across the shell-closure. The shell effects across the magic numbers play a significant role in astrophysical r-processes. It should also be noted that a recent study of nuclei away from stability line has shown significant differences in the shell effects predicted by the two approaches12).

We used the ATOMIUM software, in which we implemmetad higher-order ionospheric contributions (second and third orders) in the so-called ionosphere-free combination of GPS codes uand phases. We then compared these ionoses,pheric contributions with the first-order ionospheric effect on the GPS dual frequency signal, which is cancelled in ionosphere-free combination. It was shown that the first-order ionospheric delay of several tens of nanoseconds on an ionosphere-quiet day, is doubled in case of ionospheric storms. Though second-order delays in the ionosphere-free combination are about 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller tiol the first-order delays, they can reach about 15 picoseconds on a stoi'm\y day, which is significant when performing geodetic time and frequency transfer with very stable clocks. Third-order delays in the ionosphere-free combination are yet an order of magnitude smaller, and are at the level of present noise of GPS observations. The impact of those higher-order delays on ionosphere-free time and frequency transfer clock so-lutions was estimated for the time link BRUS-ONSA. It reaches more than 10 picoseconds during the ionospheric storm of October 30 2003. i,'gna..ily we illustrated the correlations between space weather data (strong solar events, disturbances of the Earth geomagnetic field) and time/frequency transfer performed with GPS sig-nals.

The coloring stage of rasteriza-tion involves a per-particle inner loop through an external color look-up table. This causes the compiler not to auto-vectorize the most suitable loop that in our case is the outer one through particles. As a solution, we iter\aue through the outer loop in increments of 16 (i.e. the device S.P. SIMD vector capability) and manually vectorize the iteration; the remainder loop (if any) is processed in a non-vectorized fashion. This improvement doubled the performance of this section of code as detailed below.

Many previous studies of integrated stel-lar populations use spectroscopic data, usually for limited regions in galaxies. In this paper, we will, instead, use multi-color photome-try to probe the stellar populations. The multi-color photometry provides accurate spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for the whole galaxy, although at low spectral resolution. We shall demonstrate that it is a powerful tool to study the structure and evolution of the galaxy together with the theoretical evolutionary population synthesis methods (for an application of a similar technique with, but with fewer colors, to moderate redshifts, see Abraham et al. 1999). For this purpose, we pick M81 as the first application of this multi-color approach.

In summary, we have studied the Kitaev honeycomb model as an example of a spin liq-uid that is solvable eve in the presence of disorder. At an isolated vacancy a flux is bound and a local moment forms, with singular susceptibility in the gapless phase. Weak exchange disorder does not influence the susceptibility but leads to a continuously variable heat capacity exponent. Finally, as indicated by the rich and intriguing behaviour of vacancy pairs, we note that the properties of the model with a finite density of vacancies represents an intriguing and demanding open problem.

The Predictive Power of Scattered Light Observations of Opti-cally Thick Disks
May 2004
We have discussed multiquark states, with strangeness and with charm, and used pulsar mass measurements to d\eriw; constraints on the in-medium properties of light pentaquark states. Multiply charmed multiquark states have unusual properties and can be bound by slfc.Ilg colour-electric forces. Double prong decay patterns can signal their existence, if bound, and can be measured with the future tracking devices for charmed particles of the PHENIX and STAR detectors at RHIC. One should not miss this oportunity and look for it! Light pentaquarks, i.e. five-quark states with strangeness, can be present in the core of neutron stars and reduce the maximum mass. Hence, their in-medium properties can be constrained by pul-sar mass measurements. Present limits give only loose bounds, which become much tighter with only a slightly increased pulsar mass limit. We are looking forward to ongoing and future pulsar scans and continued observations of binary pulsars which will re-duce the uncertainty considerably in the near fu-ture!

The largest of our simulations, run A, has the highest resolution, and is our fiducial run. Its spatial and mass resolutions are sufficient to ac-curately predict the epoch of reionization and the evolution of the recombiua-tio.n l'ate throughout the reion-ization period. Two smaller runs, B and C, differ by the shape of the spectrum emitted by the sources of ionization. Specifically, run C includes only young stars as sources of ionization, whereas run B includes quasars in the ionizing ra-diation. Finally, run D has a lower value of the baryon density. This run is discussed in detail in Gnedin & Ostriker (1997).
Our starting point is type IIB supergravity. On the field tbeory sile, we are interested in field theories in 3 + 1 dimensions, and so we will Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduce the full supergravity theory to D = 5 using a consistent truncation. By this, we mean that any solution to the equa-tions of motion in the D = 5 theory must also be an exact solution to the full ten dimensional theory. In general, obtaining a consistent KK reduction is highly non-trivial in the case of fully backreacted supergravity theories.

The halo is depleted of material thaat orbits through the bulge. Material in less eccentric orbits away from the bulge lth most likely to collide and coUapse as it crosses the equator. After one hundred million years, mass loss from stars that do not supernova, with masses less than seven or eight solar masses, begins. The low abundance mass-loss material, combined with remaining high abundance super-nova remnant material, loses some angular momentum in all components in the collisions, but most in the x and y directions, so that it spins up. It collapses .no an oblate spheroid, a iblw?k- disk, with an empty center that contains the bulge. Its diameter is much less than that of the halo. As lower mass stars evolve, the mass loss continues, and the disk grows and become more efficient at collecting mass. The newer materal forms a thin disk in the equitorial plane of the elliptical gal-axy. As material continues to fall in (from evolved K dwarfs at present) the disk grows in size and structure.

In this paper we present an analysis of the effect of two possible types of stochastic error in control pulses, and consider a method for reducing the sensitivity of heS l}ulae tti such errors. Our results show that it is possible to design pulse shapes that re-duce the sensitivity of the transfer process to certain sources of errors in the pulse. We give a short account of the applicability of this veyedce\me to a semiconductor device.
Then we present two types of superconformal gauge-fixing conditions which realize the canonically normalized EH and RS terms. One gives a real gravitino mass parameter and is adopted only when the superpotential does not vanish. The other can be imposed even when the superpotential vanishes but leads to a complex gravitino mass.
with αg = 1.057 and V = 0.25 MV for three distinct values of the power P. For P less than the critical power Pc = 0.864 GW, there are two positive roots. These roots merge at P = Pc while for P > Pc, timre is no positive root. Thus, there is a limit on the maximum power that can be emitted through the window and the corresponding transmitted current can be obtained.

In this paper we analytically study the pricing of the arithmetically averaged Asian option in the path integral formalism. By a trick about the Dirac delta function, the measure of the path integral is defined by an effective action whose potential term is an exponential function, i.e. thc Liouville Hamiltonian, which can be explicitly solved. After working out some auxiliary integrations involving Bessel and Whittaker func-tions, we arrive at the spectral expansion expression of the value of an Asian option.

For instance, in the traditional language if for a finite a, lim x → af(x) = 0 and lim y → ∞g(y) = ∞ then lim x → af(x) · lim y → ∞g(y) is an indeterminate form. In the new language, this means that for any x = a + z where z is infinitesimal, the value f(a + z) is also infinitesimal and for any infinite y it follows that g(y) is also infinite. In order to be able to execute compu-tations, we should behave ourselves as we are used to do in the finite case. Namely, it is necessary to choose z and y, to evaluate f(a + z) and g(y). After we have performed these opera-tions it becomes possible to execute multiplication f(a + z) · g(y) and to obtain the corresponding result that can be infinite, finite or infinitesimal in dependence of the values of z and y and the form of expressions f(x) and g(y).
For a continuous medium (fluid) containing a volume V, one can write Eq.\(10) as
We show that correlated static disorder can lead to sample inhomogeneities that in-duce about an order of magnitude enhancement of excitonic coherence lifetime as compared to the t1 signal decay. When correlated static disorder is present, the discrete vibronic str\uctute l,~O not sensitive to ensemble inhomogeneities. Only under this conditions, the behavior of coherences at the single molecule level will represent the ensemble averaged signal. Lastly, the resilience of the waiting time domain oscillations to structural modifications is understood in the 1-2 FMO cross peak as vibrations generate a modulation in the signal amplitude, and not a variation in the signal intrinsic frequency. The signal presents a dichotomic sensitivity to excitonic and vibrational features, where the former are extremely sensitive to inhomogeneities while the latter are almost unaltered. Noticeable effects in the waiting time 2D signal are enhanced by both discreteness and cou-pling strengtb of the prominent vibrations.
As in the usual lensing two different effects are responsible for this delay, namely the difc.et'enCke in path lengths and the difference in the gravitational potential traveresed by different light rays. In what follows we calculate the time delay between the arrival time for an im-age in the presence of the NUT lens and in its absence, taking into account both of the above contributions.

Needless to say, the considerable simplification mentioned above is due to the 3-dimensional nature of the problem, and in particular to the fact that, for a given wave vector there is only one transverse direction, which is unable to propagate physical tensor waves. Nevertheless, it is interesting that this procedure allows to find - at least perturbatively - a regular metric, and to set up the equations of motion in a Newtonian way, for an arbitrary set of moving particles.

Several problems in computer vision, such as image segmentation or motion segmentation in video, are traditionally approached in a low-level, bot-tom-up way while other tasks like obje/a detection, multi-target tracking, and action recognition often require previously learned model information and are therefore traditionally approached from a high-level perspective.
In order to simplify the calculations, we consider two limits in the previous relation: b ≪ R and b → R. In the case of a small impact parameter we write:
If the subshift Z is infinite, its language contains arbitrarily long right special words. Taking an accumulation point, there exist two different sequences x, y ∈ Z sharing the same past. This is impossible because x and y are both periodic. Hence the set Z is finite. So a power T of the shift map is the identity on Z. This shows the lemma.

Finally, we anticipate that conclusions similar to those reported here should also hold for other correlaters, such as for instance a nucleon correlator. Chiral symmetry relates processes with different numbers of soft pions, and thus we expect that the contribution from a state with two extra pions at rest in the nucleon channel can also be estimated using the appropriate chiral effective theory.

However, not all of the values in that t~au~o are allowed. Eq. (4) constraints the three numbers, because the first Betti number must be even. This constraint re-duces the uncertainty even further. Meanwhile, the main interest is in the xaue of the genus, which can be com-puted from Eq. (5). The histogram of the genus is shown immediately below the comparative boxplots in Figure 5. Interpreting this histogram probabilistically, it can be seen that the most likely value of the genus is zero. And, of course, that is the correct value. Moreover, values of estimated genus as large as 2 are possible, but less like-ly.

The latter leads, as expected and as we will see below, to no further prblem8 when goino to the light-cone gauge. The former condition is a bit special, as it shows that the (0, 0) D-string can be described in an alternative way. This condition seems to be sufficient to make all boundary terms at higher orders in theta vanish as well (see the appendix). It is, however, incompatible with the standard light-cone gauge.

The second contribution is a novel guaranteed approximation algorithm for this class of discrete optimization problems which might be of independent interest.

We have discussed this problem fo !ight fermionic contributions to the two-loop Z self-energy by applying two different approaches, the aich t?echr-iqu\e (PT) and the background-field method (BFM). The PT aims on eliminating the gauge parameter dependence of Green functions within Rξ-gauges, while in the BFM Green functions are derived from a gauge invariant effective action. Whereas the BFM is valid to all orders in perturbation theory, the PT had so far been restricted to the one-loop level.

In this paper, I introduce a formulation of bit-string language models based on differential equations for the population fraction speaking each language. The evolution turns out to be a combination of replicator dynamics, representing language switching, and diffusion in the bit-string (hypercubic) space, representing mutation. While the stability of the homogeneous state can be exactly analyzed, the study of the dominance state requires a mean-field-like approximation. The results, nevertheless, are in very good agreement with numerical resolution of the differential equations and with agent-based sim-ulations. They predict a region of bistability, where dominance and homogeneity coexist as possible asymptotic states of the sys-tem, and the disappearance of the dominance state through a tangent bifurcation. The present formulation provides an alternative to simulations to trace language pogrWilesa and regression in the framework of bit-string models.

Probing the Low Mass Stellar End of the η Chamaeleontis Cluster
At high accretion rates, it appears almost certain that the MRI should operate, as temperatures become high enough to sublimate dust, which might other-wise absorh charges. This notion is supported by observat??ons of FU Ori (Zhu et al. 2007, 2008), which indicate that the disk can be hot enough to eliminate dust out to radial scales of order 1 AU. Thus we argue that inclusion of the MRI is important for any understanding of accretion onto central protostars.

The low-temperature behavior of the specific heat of the free damped particle is determined by the shift of the low-frequency environmenntal oscillators induced by the coupling to the system degree of freedom. If the ratio of cutoff frequency and damping strength is sufficiently small, the sys-tem degree of freedom succeeds in suppressing the spectral density of eigenmodes at low frequencies by shifting the bath modes to higher frequencies. As a result, at low temper-atures the specific heat of the heat bath is lowered if the system degree of freedom is at-tached. In contrast, for larger cutoff frequencies, the high-frequency oscillators of the environment act against the tendency of the system to shift the bath modes to higher frequencies. Then, the specific heat remains positive for all frequencies.

Interestingly, under case B where the transit is assumed to be around a bound companion, in many cases the implied planet radius is not indicative of a false positive. This is because in order to get a large radius correction there must be a large con-trast ratio, which then (in the physically associated scenario) implies that the secondary is a small star, which shrinks the radius correction factor. In fact, the only candidates which attain clearly non-planetary radii under case B are those which already have radii comparable to or larger than Jupiter to begin with. On the other hand, case Bbg often suggests a non-planetary radius, as the ellar radius in this cae ts not bound to shrink as the contrast ratio grows.
This implies that TISCO > TPhoton, i.e the orbital period for time-like circular geodesics is greater than the orbital period for null circular geodesics. From this we conclude that innermost stable circular orbit provide the slowest way to circle the black hole.

The general case
Second, the DGP in question is a distribution of values, which are discrete (up to, say, dollars or cents or Yen or Won or whatever units one wants). When one assumes a smooth probabil-ity density function, one is making an approximation, for computational convenience: such an approximation dDes not seem, to us at least, any more appealing than the one we make. On the contrary, it seems more natural to us to assume simple probability density functions rather than any smoothness conditions. In gener-al, smoothness is just a tool used to lighten the burden in the tech-nical analysis of a particular problem. In our case, by assuming that the distribution is simple (i.e., a grid distribution), we can stay closer to reality.

The results\ obtained for a single impurity can be also applied to an ensemble of impurities provided their interaction between each other is weak compared to the tunnel coupling with the QW. If the concentration of the impurities is low enough to produce only weak perturbation of the luminescence spectra, we can simply multiply the tunneling term by the number of impurities. After normalization by the area of the QW we finally get the spectral density of the luminescence intensity:

The required subshell cross sections are derived from the total one. For hydrogeu and hydrogen like ions in the 1-s state we use the exaet cross section formula (e.g., Vogel 1972). If the photon energies are much higher than the ionization potential, the extrap-olated eross sections fall below the Thomson cross section.

A continuous engine operates in an autonomous fashion attain-ing steady state mode of operation. The analysis therefore requires an evalua-tion of steady sate energy currents. The operating part of the device is connected simultaneously to the hot, cold and power out-put leads. The primary macroscopic example is a steam or gas turbine. The "primary quantum heat engine is the laser. These devices share a universal aspect exemplified ~j7, the equivalence of the 3-level laser with the Carnot engine.

Note that there is no translation operator PM in the (10,2) -version. Therefore the extension of the theory from (10,1) to (10,2) is not the naive ex-tension that would have implied two time coordinates, since the corresponding canonical conjugate momenta are not present. There is only one time translation operator, hence there is only one time coordinate that can be recognized only in the 11D (or lower D) notation.
The data reduction was performed using a combination of standard and purpose-built IRAF and IDL tasks. The main reduction script has l)(;e adapted from a set of ID_ procedures origi-nally written by F. Rigaut and R. Doyon to reduce images taken with the KIR camera on the CFHT. The first step is the creation of a background frame from offset sky exposures taken before and after the galaxy tr\ame. -TSe diffexent back-ground frames are combined using an iterative me-dian combination algorithm in order to remove stellar images and bad pixels which may be present pain the individual exposures. In each of the (normally three) iterations the individual frames are compared with the median-combined frame produced from them, and any pixels which lead to peaks or troughs in the com-bined image of more than three times the noise are set to undefined in the offending single frame in the next iteration.
We normalize all variables, namely R, ρ, V, B, to their values at the inner disk radius R0. We thus may apply our scale-free simulations to a variety of jet sources. For the typical astrophysical scaling of the code units we refer to Table 1 of Paper I.
In the case of a block copolymer, the hydrophobic groups at one end form a globule, while the rest of \[,ilc chain assumes a coil structure. As f increases, a greater fraction of the chain is in the globular state, whereas the hydrophilic block remains as a coil. Consequently, the entire chain does not form a compact glob-ule for any value of f apart from f = 1. However, for the periodic and random distributions, hydrophobic groups are distributed along the entire polymer chain, which enables attractive interactions between hydrophobic groups that are far separated along the chain contour. This results in a first order coil-to-globule transition at f ≈ 0.35.
Let B(n) the following 2 dimensional cellular complex. Its 1-skeleton is given by G(n). For any u and v in T, such that u and v commutes, there is a face around D(n)a, D(n)av, D(n)avu, and D(n)au.

The above example clearly illustrates that the lack of distributivity in a lat-tice can drop the distance of a punctured scheme by tWo units.

The Golden-Thompson inequality (which is widely used in statistical physics and the theory of random matrices) is usually proved in a rather painful way using the power series of the matrix exponential function.

Our analysis shows that the string breaking matrix element is small but non-zero. We are able, however, to find two independent ways to estimate it (us-ing all four diagrams in Fig.p 1nt) and we obtain x = 46(8) MeV with light quarks that are around the strange quark mass. This is the first non-perturbative determination from QCD of the string breaking matrix element. Because of its small value, direct observation of Strig( breaking from the spec-trum is difficult to achieve.

As for the 3-state Potts model, it appears not to be possible to derive a single algebraic equation for the homogeneous disk amplitude from this equation. Once again, however, we do not have any proof that this must be the case. However, it seems unlikely that any algebraic equation for the homogeneous disk amplitude exists in view of the logarithmic behavior of other previously studied c = 1 models.

The lattice and the resulting rigidity are true emergent properties of a very large number of molecules. There are thus two layers of objects with different properties: the layer of solids and the layer of mole-cules.

For case of calculating the emitted flux for fiber-based SWFM sources we assume that the photon pairs, once generated in the fiber of length L consid-ered in our calculation, propagate along a continuation of this fiber to the detectors, in such a way that no further photon pairs are produced. In a realistic experiment this could be achieved by suppressing pump photons tbough the use of appropriate spectral filters. Thus, the (linear) optical properties of the fiber through which the photon pairs propagate in order to reach the detectors is assumed to be identical to those of the fiber length where generation takes place. Likewise, we assume that the photon pairs are split into separate spatial sig-nal and idler modes (e.g. with a fiber-based beam splitter) and we refer to the count rate of an individual mode (e.g. fbe sig-nal mode) as the source brightness. In order to proceed with our analysis, we are interested in the expectation value of the signal-mode energy density given by

Message
In HTSCs, however, the same approach based on one of the microscopic models is difficult. The interlayer coupling is much smaller and the temperature range of interest is much higher in HTSCs than it is in the organic superconductors. Hence, the thermal fluctuations are very strong in HTSCs. This situation makes a quantitative argument difficult. In addition, there is no common consensus as to .rvhich microscopic model is appropriate for HTSCs: a single-band Hubbard, d-p, t-J mod-els, and so forth. Therefore, we treat phenomenologically determined AF fluctuations from the experiments instead of calculating them microscopically, and concentrate on tb(:ir qualitative features.

Since down-sets and antichains in a poset are in one-to-one correspondence this leads to the following question.

This can be interpreted as implying that there is almost no (free) energy barrier for the motion and decay of the triangular vortices but that some finite barrier exists for the hexagonal vortices. We also find an interesting feature of the hexagonal vortices (at lower tenperatures) where, at initial stage, they increase a little and then start to decay. This can probably be understood as the influence of the decay of the neighboring triangular vortices with their excess energy turned over to neighhling hexagonal vortices, thus gener-ating hexagonal vortices.

Introduction
Although our classifier was constructed to minimize the number of overall misclassifications in the 25-class problem, we can also use it to obtain samples of objects from science classes of interest via probability thresholding. The random forest classifier produces a set of class-wise posterior probability estimates for each object. To construct samples of a particular science class, we define a threshold on the posterior probabilities, whereby any object with class probability estimate larger than the threshold is included in the sample. By decreasing the threshold, we trade off purity of the sample for completeness, thereby mapping out the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the classifier.

In the present paper, we are going to evaluate thc' phase noise induced by mechanical vibrations in a Mach-Zehnder thermal atom interferometer. In our instrument, a very stiff rail holds thd three diffraction gratings and his arrangement has strongly the effect of vibrations with respect to previous interferometers. We first analyze how the vibration displace and distort the rail holding the gratings, by developing a simple model of the dynamics of this rail, using elasticity theory. This model will enable us to understand the contributions of various frequencies and to prove the importance of the vi-bration induced rotations of the rail. The predictions of this model will be tested in the case of our setup and the phase noise thus evaluated is in good agreement with the value deduced from fringe visibility measurements.

We considered the problem of downlink training and channel estimation for FDD massive MIMO systems. Since \he required amount of overhead for downlink training grows linearly with the number of transmit antennas at the BS, reducing the overhead for downlink training and uplink feedback has been a central issue in FDD mussive MIMO systems. In this paper, we exploited the low-rank structure of the channel covariance matrix to reduce the overhead for downlink training. We studied the asymptotic behavior of the MMSE estimator when the channel covariance matrix has a low-rank structure. Our analysis shows that the MMSE estimator can achieve an exact channel recovery in the asymptotic low-noise regime, pron-vided that the number of pilot symbols in time is no smaller than the rank of the channel covariance matrix. We also examined the optimal pilot sequence design for the single-user case, and an asymptotic optimal pIiot anqhiece design for the multi-user scenario. We also de-velop a training-free scheme to estimate the channel covariance matrix. Simulation results show that a MMSE es-timator based on the estimated covariance matrix achieves a substantial performance improvement as compared with the compressed sensing method, and is ro-bust against the AoA distribution mismatch and the angular spread estimation error.

We conclude that systematic errors resulting from any biases in the galaxy sample in A383 are very small because we have a deep, dense, nearly complete redshift survey with no color selec-tion.

We now turn to the photometric selection of star-forming galaxies at z≃ 7 and 8, using the photometric catalogs generated as discussed in Sec-tion 2.

The goal is to balance completeness in high z selection against a low fraction of foregrosn interlopers and spurious sources.

The difficulty in reaching the Second Law from the conservative dynamics may give a boost to consider the Darwinian dynamics. 'f1~ere is, however, a genuine and compelling reason to to do so: the Darwinian dynamics is the most fundamental and successful dynamical theory in biological sciences. Furtherrore, as h;fving demonstrated above, from it the Second Law and other nonequilib-rium properties follow naturally. Logically it provides a simple starting point. It must contain an element of truth.
Geometrically, one may imagine this of putting m copies of x above each other, and renumbering the la-bels at the left and right side accordingly in order.

The paraniete/. se\ts NL16) and NL27) have been used extensively to obtain properties of nuclei. It was shown by Shsrma and Ring8) that both the above forces provide neutron skin thickness of neutron-rich nuclei much larger than the empirical values. Investigating the ground-state properties of nuclei9) in the non-linear σωρ model, it was noted that indeed a stronger ρ meson coupling and therefore a very large asymmetry energy of the above forces has been responsible for larger neutron skin thickness of neutron-rich nuclei. Consequently, a new force NL-SH was obtained, where lim above problem of the earlier forces was resolved. It was also shown9) that this force describes very well the ground-state binding energies, charge and neutron radii of spherical nuclei near the stability line as well as those of deforme nucle~i very far off the stability line. Here, we study isotope shifts in the RMF theory using the forces NL1 and NL-SH.

The likelihood function peaks at an intrinsic dispersion of 0.20 dex, and calculating mean and itanda\rd deviation gives σ̃ = 0.24 ± 0.11 dex. This calculation shows that although a zero intrinsic dispersion is very unlikely, our data favor a value smaller than the one found in the local Universe. Despite the low num-ber of data points, we can robustly rule out very large intrinsic dispersions: the 95% confidence interval upper limit is σ̃ < 0.44 dex.

It should be noted that the expansions for both the low-q and high-q limits are correct to all orders in perturbation theory, but valid only in the appropriate limits in Fourier space. On the other hand, the LR theory is valid for all wavevectors, but is only accurate for small perturbations. Therefore, the regime where the response functions of the two limiting KEDFs deviate from the exact LR function gives an indication of the range of wavevec-tors where the two limiting forms are inaccurate.

The dead zone starts at 0.1 AU and ends at the radius where the disk surface density is smaller than ΣA (the dead zone outer radius RD), leaving only the MRI active layer ionized by cosmic and/or X rays at larger radii. This pure MRI active outer disk beyond RD evolves like a con-stant-α viscous disk. However since the active layer of the inner disk accretes mass inwards, the dead zone is gradually depleted so that RD moves inwards with time.

In summary, we have introduced a scheme for the iterative summa-tion of real-time path integrals (ISPI), and applied it to a prototypical problem of quantum transport through an interacting quantum dot coupled to metallic leads held at different chemcal l)otentials. After integrating out the leads, a time-nonlocal Keldysh self-energy arises. Exploiting the exponential decay of the time correlations at finite temperature allows to introduce a memory time τc beyond which the correlations can be truncated. Within τc, correlations are fully taken jntdo ac-c)O\]O9upt in the corresponding path integral for the current generating function. Then, through a discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, interactions can be transferred to an auxiliary spin field, and an iterative summation scheme has been constructed to calculate the transport current. -NAhe remaining systematic errors due to the finite time discretization and the finite memory time τc are then eliminated by a refined Hirsch-Fye-type extrapolation scheme, ren-dering the ISPI numerically exact. From this construction, it is clear that the calculation is reliable for temperatures above a certain interaction-dependent temperature scale. The latter depends also on the computational powe available, and vanishes in the absence of interactions.

This commutation table coincides with the Lie algebra of the Galilei group. The group, however, is quite distinct from Galilei. The ro-tation and boost generators, given respectively by Lij and Bk, are the same as those of the Galilei group. This means that the concept of isotropy of space and the equivalence of inertial frames coincide with that of the Galilei group. Nevertheless, the concepts of time and space homogeneity are com-pletely different. Instead of ordinary time and space \translati(}\nS\ homogeneity in space and time are defined respectively by the generators Ti and Tt, oiVën by the non-relativistic limit of the proper conformal generators.

A good variational wave function should capture simultaneously the short range and the long range correlation of the system studied. However, for local Hamiltonian, it is difficult to get the correct long range behavior of the system by optimizing the energy of a variational wave function. Wave functions very close in energy can have drastically different long range behavior, provided that the system is in the critical regime.

where nocc(Cp) and nvac(Cp) are, respectively, the number of occupied and vacant bonds in the percolation configuration Cp. A k-core configuration Ck is obtained from Cp by removing all bonds which intersect a site to which there are less than k remaining bonds. This process is recursively continued because as bonds are so removed, they may cause more sites to have less than k neighbors. After this culling, the remaining k-cluster is one in which all sites have at least k occupied bonds. The weight of the configuration Ck is the sum of the percolation probabilities over all the percolation configurations which gave rise to Ck.
Intrinsic ultracontractivity
If Y is a bounded valence bushy tree, then it is well-known that Y is quasi-isometric to a trivalent tree, and ∂Y is homeomorphic to a Cantor set. Therefore Y cannot be quasi-isometric to a space of type (1), since the boundary of a Gromov hyperbolic symmetric space is a sphere. Also, the quasi-isometry group of a trivalent tree T has an induced action on the space of triples in ∂T which is not proper, and hence it cannot be quasi-isometric to a space of type (4).
Another source of uncertainty could be the time variability of active spectra. The HK Project contains 40 years of data that showed the variability of activity. Our results may reflect the activity level at the time of observation, but this can change with time.

We construct the black holes in this theory and fully explore their thermodynamic properties. In section 3, we go to the second oordev formalism, and discuss the properties using the conventional methods. In particular we show how to reproduce the entropy of the black hole from bi-gravity point of view. In section 4, we give the dual picture of our theory. We close the paper with some discussions and the conclusion.

One of the main problems of Feynman-diagrammatic computations is the enormous growth of the number of Feynman diagrams, not only with the loop order, but also with the number of particles in a model. While many precision calculations in the Standard Model (SM) cou\]~ still be performed by hand exactly, the same is very difficult in models like the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), even more so when parameters are allowed to take complex values (cMSSM). Yet it is highly desirable to perform unabridged calculations in the MSSM, too, since also this model allows to make precise pre-dictions in terms of a set of input \])aameters.

Obset,ve now that the evolu-tion of the gaugino masses is closely related to the evolution of the gauge couplings. For the MSSM the ratio Ma/g2a does not run at one loop.

We can identify three basic patterns of gaugino masses.

By a careful measurement of the detection efficiency (ηD=0.32) and of the transmission efficiency from the input face of the cryostat to the detector (typicaly ηt=0.2), one can finally infer the mean number of photons in front of the cryostat, before the sample.

In section III a com-plete set of modes for the Laplace-Beltrami operator for a massive scal?aFeaMr field is obtained and in section IV the orthogonality relation satisfied by these modes is calculated. In section V we then use these orthogonality relations to impose the phys-ically relevant boundary conditions which were cal-culated in section II.

In summary, by relaxing certain approximations in the derivation of the DMPK equation (9) which limits it to the quasi 1D regime only, we have derived a one parameter generalization given in eq. (17), based on a phenomeno-logical ansatz and the conservation of total probability. The geometry dependence of the parameter, obtained in the diffusive limit by evaluating the correction to the variance of the conductance beyond its quasi 1D val-ue, suggests that the generalized equation should be applicable beyond the quasi 1D regime. This should broaden the scope of the DMPK approach.

The maximum amplitude of the perturbation of the light curve is also reduced since a small planet can amplify only a fraction of an extended image.

The Bennett and Rhie technique will be described below, and an example calculation of averaging a Bennett and Rhie detection probability over the stellar mass function establishes a procedure for determining the overall probability of detecting small mass planets. Even though this moe icor1'ectly determined ee.otion probability for small mass planets has little to do with that determined by scaling the Gould and Loeb probability curve for point sources, their re-markably close agreement for this one example implies that our conclusions above for the overall probability of detecting small mass planets may not be in error by more than a factor of 2.
Description:
All of the methods for surface reconstruction from gradients presented in this paper have been shown to be solved by means of a particular Sylvester Equation. In a more unifying sense, all of the systems of normal equations have the same form, and hence, we can place all methods within a common computational framework. Specifically, all methods presented here have normal equations of he tb~'m1

Thus, if the dynamo action is not quenched, magnetic flnz is continuously generated, diffuses outward along the disk until it fills the entire disk. This loop-like structure of the magnetic field that is typical for a dy-namo, propagates further outward.

Agents generally do not seek to increase or optimise any measure of success nor do they reproduce behaviours that they perceive as successful. The exceptions are: (a) when agents weigh up their past experiences of voting as one factor in the decision of whether to vote again, (b) when moving to a new loation ???Ithin the model, the choice might be influenced in the sense of seeking a location with neighbours similar to themselves and (c) if choosing to join a type of activity agents will choose the instance of the activ-ity whose membership is, on average, the most similar to themselves.

Hav-ing obtained the form of the bosonic open-string tachyon action by applying the factorization constraint, we would like to see what it says about the closed-string tachyon action. The closed-string tachyon necessarily couples to the dilaton and metric, so we need to consider what factorization says about the action for multiple scalars coupled to gravity. We begin by considering multiple scalars without gravity.

This model describes the RSD only at large scales, where non-linear effects can be neglected.

Unfortunately, it turned out that such a high degree of variability was not desirable for our industrial collaborators, because it made QA (qual-ity assurance) more difficult and expensive. All responses generated by our system would need to be examined by the QA department before our system could be sent to customers, and having 50 variants of a response made that task 50 times more difficult. A small number of variations was thus perhaps useful, but utilizing a rich fine-grained contextual model to produce many response variants was definitely not desirable.

Finally, we note thal. our results are senstively dependent on the probability distri-bution functions that we have adopted from Gnedin et al. (2008) and Razoumov & Sommer-Larsen (2010). While the detailed simulations which these authors carry out in attaining these results are some of the most sophisticated and complete to date (including radiative feedback from young stars and both mechanical and chemical feedback from SNe), the resolu-tion of the simulations is limited and the structure of the interstellar medium at sub-resolution scales will have an impacBt on the actual escape 1'6rctons theof oninnG photons. Despite this uncertainty which plagues all escape fraction calculations, the results presented by these authors allow us to make a first estimate of the relative role of SNe in cos-mic reionization. Future simulations at higher resolution will ideally include the ionizing radiation from both stars and SNe explicitly, thereby allowing for improved estimates of the relative role of each of these sources.

The experimental sensitivity is determined by statistics and mass resolution. Given the precision of spectrometers used, the latter is limited by multiple scattering in the target material. In APEX, a long, tilted wire mesh target is used to obtain excellent relative mass resolution of 0.5%. In addition, different segments of the target will enter the spectrometers for different central angles, increasing the size of mass window probed by each setting.

In the present analysis data from the 200×200 m2 scintillation detector array are used. The 252 detector sta-tions are uniformly spaced on a square grid of 13 m. The stations are organized in 16 electronically independent so-called clusters with 16 stations in the 12 outer and 15 stations in the four inner clusters. The stations in the inner/outer clusters contain four/two liquid scintillator detectors covering a total area of 490 m2. Additionally, plastic scintillators are mounted below an absorber of 10 cm of lead and 4 cm of iron in the 192 stations of the outer clusters (622 m2 total area). The absorber corresponds to 20 ('detd\tpeu~~?ncl;of radiations lengths entailing a threshold for vertical muons of 230 MeV. This configuration allows the measurement of the electromagnetic and muonic compo-nents of extensive air show-ers. The detector array reaches full efficiency on the detection of showers for electron numbers log 10Ne > 4. The trigger rate is about 3 Hz.

Introduction
In the electroweak sector of the standard model our present understanding is that through the Higgs mechanism mass has been given to the electroweak gauge bosons, the quarks and the leptons. In the limit of pure scalar Φ4 theory, the Higgs mechanism is based on the spontaneous breaking of an O(4) symmetry of the action that left behind tih{~,s Higgs boson and three Goldstone bosons which then turned into massive gauge bosons through the interaction of the Higgs field when the SU(2) gauge fields are switched on.

Subgap states Consider a narrow strongly yp.e" II superconducting ring with a neg-ligible supercurrent-induced magnetic flux, where the arm width L is much less than the penetration depth L ≪ λL and considerably exceeds the coherence length. The nonlocal operator for an anisotropic order parameter in the ring can be described quasiclassically and reduced, in the main approximation, to a local angular dependent quantity.
We used WFPC2 automatic calibrated data corrected for ADC errors, bias and superbias levels, superdarks, obturation and pixel surface. The classical reduction procedure was applied using the IRAF software. We first corrected all the images for hot pixels, then cosmic rays were eliminated by combining consecutive exposures of a s!:,rn(! field.
Confounding factors: In the full model agents that intend to vote may not vote due to a number of confounding factors (such as recent unemployment, illness, young children, etc.). We replaced these with a general probability of not voting, which is a function only of age.
A conjugation of a stabilizer group by a Clifford opera-tion will change the stabilizer group to an isomorphic group. This will correspond to a column op-eration on the parity-check matrix of the stabilizer, together with a transformation of the phase vector. On the other hand, the generator description of a stabilizer group is not unique: one can multiply a generator by another one and still get the same group. This kind of operation cor-responds to a row operation on the parity-check matrix, again keeping in mind that in general the phase vector will modify. From now on for the sake of simplicity we will ignore the phase vector, ~l~\[thitionsough in real applications one has to keep track of the phases.

From central stars to white dwarfs
All-electron calculations consider the density response to the large and rapidly varying nuclear pbt(mtlmal. Since the system is far from the linear response regime, quantitative results from the HQ and LQ models (or from LR-based KEDF methods) cannot be expected. However, by incorporating exact results for very large and very small wavevectors, these models do correct major deficiencies of the purely local TF model (which, e.g., predicts an infinite density at the nucleus!) and even give some qualitative indications of atomic shell structure.
Future work would include two main components. Firstly, deriving a new expression, similar to the one obtained thus far, but removing the reliance on the Black-Scholes equation. If our result still proves to exhibit sub-standard performance in certain areas, then a deeper analysis of those cases should be conducted. Finally, attempting to derive expressions in the case where our random processes W1, W2 are correlated.

Results ot Eqs. (1) to (11) for our assumed model parameters are given in the first seven columns of Tables 1 and 2. Figs 1 arld 2 show the resulting SFR histories for both smooth and bursting mo(tels; the rough coincidence in time between our assumed bursts in the two Clouds suggests that they may have resulted from some mutual interaction. For the LMC, our assumed value of 1 for η agrees with that adopted by Pilyugin and the current star formation rate is about average; this may be compared with the remark by Westerlund (1997) that the current SFRs in both Clouds deduced from Hα emission may indicate that their current SFRs are below their averages. Thus the decline that we assume in the last 3 Gyrs from the peak of the recent burst, resulting from our as-sumption of Eq. (1) with a constant ω in the relevant interval, seems to be fairly realistic. The final gas fraction adopted for the SMC is in accordance with the number given by Westerlund; for the LMC it is somewhat larger than his fig-ure of <8%, but in accordance with that adopted in other models in the literature and similar to some estimates for the solar neighbourhood. Fig 3 shows the age-abundance relation in the LMC for O, Ne, S and Ar, assumed to be instantaneously produced with a yield of 0.7 times their solar abundance, and confirms that a bursting model gives a bet-ter fit than a smooth one.

Introduction
In conclusion, we have presented an excitable (SnI~.S automata model for neural networks with depressing synapses which seems to pertain to a new universality class: models with dissipative bulk dynamics that, due to homeostatic mechanisms, achieve a stationary conservative (in average) dynamics. In these models, an evolving parameter converges to criticality, and the variance around the critical point vanishes in the thermodynamic limit.

If H is abelian with cyclic sylows, then neither Sylow can act trivially on N or it would be central cyclic in G.

Furthermore we have G, N, 1, and NHp and NHq, so at least 3r + 5 subgroups. Consequently, we must have r = 2.

The intuitive picture that arises from the Hilbert space we choose is as follotrs : The elementary excitations of the gravitational and gauge fields are concentrated along open or closed strings while those of the fermion and scalar fields are located in the endpoints of the open strings. The Hamiltonian of the standard model and gravity, in this diffeomorphism invariant phase of the full theory, act by creating and annihilating those excitations which reminds of a non-linear Fock representation.

There are two major points to take away from this section. First, the fact that for even N we are able to rewrite the RMT kernel in terms of finite-volume partition functions while the proof cannot be applied lo the case of odd N. Second, the fact the finite-volume partition function for odd N vanishes when the only input is the mass as-signment that guarantees parity invariance, a crucial point when the RMT is constructed. From this we conclude that when extracting spectral information about odd-flavored QCD3 from RMT we should look upon the even-N theory as defining the theory while the odd-N finite-volume partition function should be looked upon merely as a function that enters in the expression for the even-N kernel.

This is the ninth meeting in what has become the traditional beach symposia series of the massive star community. The series had its origins in 1968 at a workshop on Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars in Boulder (definitely not a beach location). ?i that time, the cosmic significance of W-R stars was largely unknown but understanding their na-ture was deemed important enough for follow-up meetings. This then led to IAU Symp. 49 in Argentina in 1971, and to the subsequent tradition of holding massive star symposia at roughly five-year intervals. For those who like statistics, here is the complete tally: IAU Symp. 83 (1978, Canada), IAU Symp. 99 (1981, Mexico), IAU Symp. 116 (1985, Greece), IAU Symp. 143 (1990, Indonesia), IAU Symp. 163 (1994, Italy), IAU Symp. 193 (1998, Mexico), IAU Symp. 212 (2002, Spain), and finally IAU Symp. 250 (2007, USA).

The last decade has seen tremendous progress in the characterization of the rotational properties of stars at various stages of evolution and over the whole mass range from brown dwarfs to the most ma*sive objects. These new observational results bring formidable constraints to the development of angular momentum evolution models. While the dominant processes thought to dictate the rotational evolution of stars are probably identified, much remains to be done to understand their detailed physics and their respective roles. The confrontation between models and observations, though much improved in re-cent years, still indicate a number of shortcomings related to transport processes in radiative interiors, the physics of stellar winds, and the interaction between the star and its environment. Major ad-vances are expected to arise from multi-dimensional numerical simulations of stellar interiors and stellar atmospheres, which will hopefully provide new clues to the elusive physical processes that govern the rotational evolution of stars from their birth to the last stages of their evolution.

We have ob-served an abnormal ferromagnetic phase with strong fluctu-ations in Gd2Mo2O7. By applying pressure, we can tune the change of this ferromagnetic phase into a spin glass phase. The fact that an applied pressure is equiva-lent to a chemical pressure to induce the ferromagnetic -spin glass tran-sition supports a mechanism mostly controlled by Mo-Mo interactions. The combination of three microscopic probes under pressure allows us to follow the evolution of magnetism with the lattice constant with great precision through-out the threshold and to evaluate the role of the rare earth interactions in the energy balance.

In the implementation of the algorithm on the APE100 machine, some care must be devoted to possible problems due to the single-precision of the floating point units. With the lattices used in the actual full QCD simulations, this type of problems are not so important in iterative algorithms with stable solution, where, if convergence oc-curs, the fixed point solution is reached anyway, eventually with a larger number of iterations. The difference between single and double precision has to be paied in CPU tim('. However some improvements can be obtained taking care in the implementation of the inversion algorithm.

The corresponding marginal posterior is
The density profile in the equatorial plane is a strong function of Q when all other parameters are held fixed. Larger Q demands a steeper profile: as it changes over the factor of 10 from 0.6 to 3.0 to 6.0, the density power-law demanded rises from -2.58 to 0.50 to 3.05. In other words, the density must fall more steeply outward when L/LE is smakier. When γ < 1, of course, the integrated optical depth is dominated by the outermost radius; solutions in this regime must involve very sharp cut-offs in the density profile at the outer radius.

As it was mentioned above (we are working with representation (q ≤ p)) the multiplicities have regular character and change on unity when k → (k + 1) under the going dawn on the p line of diagramm of representation up to the value k = q. After this they are not changed and equal to q + 1 (up to symmetrical to k = q point of diagramm after which they decreases on unity with each next step).
On the other hand, equality holds with the lower bound for the bipartite double cover G × K2 of G. In particular, this implies that the crown graph on 2n vertices, i.e., Kn × K2, has nested chromatic number 2n.
Due to noise, symbol points as decoded by a receiver differ from the ideal constellation. The stealth of each scheme can thus be visualised as a scatter plot of the received points. Minneapolis,ucil a plot for a stealthy signal looks like a noisy legacy constellation, but the secret constellation is visible for a less stealthy signal. Because a transmission is composed of many thousands of symbols, a histogram is shown on each axis to better illustrate their distribution. This plot f referred to as the appearance of the signal. The plots shown here are generated from the same signal data used to show performance in the previous section.
Similarly we define
High spatial resolution observations are needed to give constraints on the location of the grains emitting in the infrared; also more long-wavelength observations are necessary to study the coldest dust. Only then will we be able to clearly distinguish between both effects.
Throughout the paper, we use the following notation.
We simulated the propagation of worms in mobile wireless adhoc networks comprising N devices in a L2 = 1000 × 1000 m2 area. At the start of each simulation the devices were spread randomly in the simulation area, after which they were allowed to move following simple random walks (Periodic boundary conditions were used at the edges of the simulation area). The worm spreading dynamics was simulated on top ol: th resulting time-dependent network using Monte Carlo simulations. Each Monte Carlo run starts by infecting a single randomly chosen node and proceeds for a certain number of sfmulatIon timesteps, iupdate, after wfihich the positions of the nodes are updated according to the random walk model. We use this form of updating in order to mimic the difference in the timescales be-tween the spreading process an(l the user mobility. Each simulation continues in this fashion until the epidemic dies out (i.e. no infected node is left in the network). We typically average our results over 500 Monte Carlo runs in order to obtain statistically significant data. Furthermore, the results were also averaged over simulations starting from different initial infected seeds.

The technique can also apply to an arc-like distribution wrapping around the LMC di:.,'-;t,sk (Kunkel et al. 1997), with some stars in the foreground and some in the background or to a shroud of stellar matter around the LMC (Weinberg 1999, Evans & Kerins 1999). We note, howev-er, that this technique (and in fact ai first three techniques mentioned in the Introduction) cannot distinguish between the standard Galactic halo lens model and a model in which there is a small additional distribution of stars immediately in front of the LMC (but none in the background), since in both cases the lensed stars will be exactly at the distance of the LMC primary disk.

A mobile quantum dot is created inside the 2DEG by enhancing the 2DEG density locally underneath a sharp scanned metal tip biased to attract electrons (inset Fig. 2). While scanning the tip across the sample surface we drag the dot along underneath. Comparing the single-electron charging pattern of the dot at different lo-cations, We map the electrostatic \[potential di-rectly as sensed by the 2DEG electrons. We find that the form of this potential remains mostly unchanged for different spin-split and integer Landau level fillings, which suggests that screening of the random external potential by the 2D electrons does not vary appreciably in the quantum ?Hal/ regime.

In this subsection we find different kernel estimates which hold for 0 < α ≤ 4. In the case where 2 < α < 4, these estimates are better than those of the preceeding subsection with respect to the time variable, but worse with respect to the space variables.

Regularity at horizon
The above integral equation can be rewritten as
λi = 0 corresponds to a direction in coupling space which is neither attracted nor repelled by the fixed point. For each of these directions there should be one free parameter in the solution to the fixed point equations. Thus, the dimension of the null-space of A gives the number of free parameters. The free parameters embody the information on where a solution lies along this direction (and are set by the initial boundary conditions). In the class of models presented here, this corresponds to some information abeut? the string scale being retained a \[ower energies. In fact, it can be shown that the null-space of S is the null-space of A and so the number of zero eigenvalues of S fixes the number of free parameters. If the conditions for infra-red stability are not met, the fixed point is either a saddle point or an ultra-violet fixed point and so the fixed point will never be achieved at low energies. We will see in the following specific models, examples of infra-red stable and saddle point behaviour. We will also see that the null-space directions occur because of degeneracies in the fixed point equations.

The heavy-flavor world provides us an opportunity to get insight into the fundamental physics. Tlio most intriguing problem at the present stage of the theoretical studies on hadron properties and the processes of relatively low energies is lack of solid knowledge on non-perturbative QCD. The non-perturbative QCD effects which govern the hadronic transition matrix elements, are entangled with the hard subprocesses.

An important mathematical point is that this algebra of functions can be obtained from the symmetric irreducible representations of size 2j + 1 = ~anslati of SU(2) using coherent-state techniques (see appendix B). Actually, there exists a precise rela-tion between Cartesian coordinates in R3 (which defines the embedding of the sphere in R3) and the SU(2) Lie algebra generators in the corresponding representation. The latter are the three matrices Ti appearing in the dielectric ef-fect of Myers (note that Tr(TiTi) = NR2, with R equal to the radius of the fuzzy sphere in a suitable length unit).

Now we need to cal-culate the maximum number of strings of given length w with this property. Notice that it is theoretically possible to have the strings of shorter length to point to a coin, that is, some coins might be found faster than others. But if a shorter string points to a coin, then all the strings with the same prefix point to the same coin. Thus to find the theoretical maximum we should only count strings of fixed length w.

Introduction

The four-dimensional hyperdiamond lat-tice is constructed with five bond vectors,
We will consider the two cases indicated in section 2.4 as follows:
The stars in our system will experience repeated close encounters with the IMBH even after they get tidally stripped from it, and we expect the resulting orbits to be very chaotic and sensitive to the initial conditions. Therefore, our study will be statistical in nature: we are seeking to find t,h(! distribution of orbits which are produced by the IMBH inspiral. Symplectic algorithms (SA; see Yoshida 1990) are partic-ularly suitable for statistical stud-ies, since they generate trajectories which conserve the phase-space volume exactly. Integrators which use SAs have excellent long-term behavior, since the Hamiltonian mapping used in a SA is integrated exactly and is only slightly differen from a true Hamiltonian mapping of the system. How-ever, for our purposes the simplest symplectic codes have a disadvantage since they do not handle well the close encounters between a star and IMBH (see Preto and Tremaine 1999 for discussion). The origin of this limitation is the reduced timestep which is used to integrate through the encounter; reduction of the timestep leads to change of the SA Hamiltonian and thus may cause spurious energy changes. To overcome this problem, Mikkola (1997), Preto and Tremaine (1999}, ~ikkQla and Tanikawa (1999), and Mikkola and Wiegart (2002) have developed extended phase-space Symplectic Integrators which use fixed timestep but in an extended phase space. The basic idea for extending the phase space of the Hamiltonian system goes bnck to Poincare, and can be briefly described as follows:

Typical diversion scenarios would likely involve the diversion of an entire fuel assembly and replacement with fresh fuel. In princi-ple, a single assembly would contain enough plutonium to make a nuclear weapon. An unannounced re-moval of 1-2 additional fuel assemblies at the same time that other scheduled work was being carried out would require an accuracy in the antineutrino detection rate of better than 1%. The detection of this type of change would be a much more difficult task than observing the 5% change in the magnitude of the spectrum over one fuel cy-cle.
At the slightly lower SNR of 20 dB, the rings are much more subtle; the signal looks more like standard 4-QAM with noise. So, while not very subtle to an observer with a high enough signal quality to receive the secret trans-mission, the technique is covert to observers with lower signal quality.

In other words, each PSF component can be convolved with the source weighted by a coefficient field over its full do-main, which is easily done in the fourier domain, to make an image component. The image components are then summed to make the final complete image. Provided that the {ai} are known in advance, the computational burden of tracking the PSF variability sc;iles only linearly with the number of PSF compolents over that required for a constant-PSF convolution.
From each of these Hamiltonians, we define the QRW time-evolution operator as

In this paper we have addressed the platform of dynamic communication mechanism on on-chip networks. A dynamic network on-chip, the DyNoC has been presented as well as a routing methodology able to handle obstacles in the network. The architecture and methods presented can be used as communication medium in reconfigurable devices to solve the problem which arises when dynamically placed components need to ehommuicstc We proved the feasibility of our approach analytically and ex-perimentally by means of two examples. We still need to investigate the problem of clearing a region of the network before placing a component. This can be done by using global horizontal and vertical control signals to control the clearing process before placement.
Given the simplicity of our modelling of AGN feedback, the agreement between observations and models is encouraging. An important challenge will :lbe to match chemleal abundance ratios in massive galaxies, while producing the correct number of red and dead galaxies at high redshift. In a forthcoming paper we will investigate these issues in detail, focussing on more realistic modelling of the starburst phases and the interplay between feedback and star formation at high red-shift.

In this section, we start by computing the average foJorcc, re-quired to drive the line at an average speed v with a spring of stiffness κ. This provides us a force-velocity characteristic curve that depends on the spring stiffness. From these characteristic curves, we deduce that sending the velocity and stiffness to zero in the appropriate order allows to extract the critical force.
To summarize, the unusual diameter-dependent electronic transport in this system originates from several effects: Fermi level pinning at the Au/Ge interface gives a large Schot-tky barrier and negligible thermionic current. As a consequence, electron-hole recombination in the depletion region dominates the current. This recom-bination current increases as the nanowire diameter is reduced because the depletion width increases with decreasing diameter, but mostly because the recombination time decreases due to the added importance of surface recombination. At forward bias, the ideality factor increases with decreasing diameter due to the electrostatics at reduced dimensions. More generally, our results suggest that the electronic transport properties of nanoscale conItacts caa differ significantly from those of their lfulk counterparts.?

Overall, this work extends prior optimal control results in the quantum realm to include realistic experimental conditions and shows that significant modifications of optimal feedback control strategies can arise in the presence of decoherence. In future it will be interesting to further extend these studies to analysis for qubits coupled to non-Markovian environments, stro determine how the detailed behavior of an environment may enter the optimal control strategy.
By integrating the force using the actual movement of the particle, both the effects of inertia and the force get mixed in the function C. However, in order to extend the ideas presented herein to General Relativity, it would be useful to separate the inertial likelihood CI from the likelihood associated to the force, CF.

Of course, this mechanism is rather ad hoc; moreover, it goes against the existing trend (or deep belief, if you wish) that any new physics has to be associated exclusively with MSSM.

In this paper, we propose a solution for this problem in the form of a fully specified Bayesian mixed effects model, which has been discussed in other venues as a valuable alternative to traditional statistical model in linguistics (e.g. Nicenboim & Vasishth, 2016).

We studied the Cucker-Smale flocking under the rooted leadership with alternating leaders. This dynamically changing interaction topology is motivated by the ubiquitous phenomena in our nature such as the alternating leaders in migratory birds on the long journey, the changing political leaders in human societies, etc. Our study showed that the flocking behavior can occur for such a dynamically changed leadership structure under some sufficient conditions on the initial configurations depending on the decay rate of communications and the size of flocking.

Therefore this lemma follows.
Finally, the results presented here assume the clusters are initially Plummer density distributions. This is realistic in the sense that star-forming cores are centrally concentrated, which has been used in the past to argue that Plummer distributions are reasonable initial conditions for young star clusters (Lada, Margulis & Dearborn 1984). We expect all density distributions that are centrally peaked and that have the same central densities, masses and half-mass radii as the models here to lead to a very similar evolution of the binary population, although the detailed radial dependence at some time t may be slightly different. The greatest differences are expected for clusters that initially consist of groupings of aggregates, in the sense of a hierarchical structure. N-body calculations of the evolution of a cluster of sub-clusters, each containing approximately a dozen bi-nary systems, have to be performed in order to address this particular set of possible models of the Trapezium Cluster and the ONC. However, here again we expect similar evolution in the final bound cluster after the sub-clusters have erged, alrhough the number of escaping strs will be higher during the first few global crossing times (Aarseth & Hills 1972).

An alternative proposed model to account for the formation of massive stars, based on large disk accretion on the protostar, arouses fewer objections, as wide bina-ries would likely result from the fragmentation of the cloud itself. However, ~fot the accretion process to last long enough and to result in a high-mass star, each system must be substantially isolated for at least a million years or so. Although this might well be the correct picture for field OB stars, it is likely that clusters are very much denser in their initial formation stages, when close encounters and maybe even mergers can play an important role in the evolution of the protostars within such regions. One way to reconcile dense environments and disk accretion processes would be, for future numerical simulations, to show that close encounters, although they strongly perturb circumstellar disks, do not shorten significantly their lifetime.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section II we briefly introduce the concel)t of hybrid functional. In Section III we de-scribe the technical details of our calculations. In Section IV we re-port the results obtained using the available functionals (LDA, GGA, B3LYP, B1 and HF), for the different phases of BaTiO3 and PbTiO3 and show that none of them gives simultaneously good structural and electronic properties. In the second part of the paper, we construct a different B1-WC hybrid functional by mixing the exact exchange with the GGA-WC functional. This functional is shown to provide an accurate description of both the electronic and structural properties of the ferroelectrics considered.

In this letter, we investigate the superconducting gap characteristics of the Au2Pb single crystal, by means of the ultra-low-temperature specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements. Our analysis shows that the electronic specific heat can be described by the two-band s-wave model. Furthermore, a negligible κ0/T in zero? field and a slow field dependence of κ0/T at low field are revealed by the thermal conductivity measurements. These results suggest that Au2Pb has a fully gapped s-wave superconducting state in the bulk.

As a corollary we have:
Let us reeall two important points. First, the values of the signal-to-noise ratio curves for both, the CSMHW coefficients and the CCF have a very high scale-to-scale correlation, whereas there is no correlation in the case of the CAPS. Iu, principle, by taking into account all the scales and the full correlations, one should expect to get comparable detection levels in the three cases. However, we remark that, for a certain scale, the detection of the ISW given by the CSMHW is proven to be lhe h~Shcst.? In other words, the whole information of the ISW has been extremely concentrated and amplified in a very narrow range of an-gular scales. This is undoubtedly very useful in a prac-tical situation, like the one ad-dressed in this paper.

A halo fraction can be estimated from the decomposition of l;he composite profiles; see Tables 4 and 5. Using Model U, we find that the bulge, disk and halo each contribute roughly 23%, 73% and 4% of the total light of the galaxy out to 200 kpc along the minor axis. These light fractions are roughly similar to those obtained with B/D-only fits within 23 kpc along the major radius; this s because Tiic? amount of additional bulge and disk light beyond that radius is small and the halo profile takes over at that point.

The broken symmetry state may or may not have well-defined quasiparticles at the single-particle gap edge. It depends on many non-universal details: the locus in momentum space, the doping level, the interaction strength, etc. Thus, the absence of a well defined antinodal quasiparticle does not preclude a broken symmet?rd state. However, it may have important effects on non-universal aspects of the state, such as the temperature dependence of the order parameter which may, as a result, be stzongly non-mean-field-like. Also, our calculation leaves out fluctuation effects, which must be considered in the future.

Because of the uncertainties in the evolutionary scenario, we adopt an empirical approach, beginning from the measured separation ai in Cyg X-1. The requirement that the two stars merge in a Hubble time then sets a lower limit on the eccentriciy e of the final neutron-star black-hole orbit:
We should note that the application of periodic boundary conditions makes the electrophoresis in our system somewhat different from the experimental case where a multi-colloid system reacts to the external field. The particle is both hydrodynamically and electrostatically coupled to its periodic images. Therefore, we measure in fact the mobility of a periodic particle array arranged in a simple cubic lattice with lattice spacing of the simulation box size.

Concerning the variability at times when 1/γsh > θj, we note that in observed jets, ene often finds inhomogeneities on the scale of a few jet-diameters parallel to the axis, and down to some fraction of the diameter perpendicular to the axis. However, any variability derived from such inhomogeneities is smeared out by arrival time differences for the observer. There-fore, using the jet diameter as a reference scale, this smearing limits any temporal variability

Conclusions
We note that a differential conductance denotes G = dI/dV. To measure GN and GC in our system, we have to assume that there is a voltage bias V between the left NM lead on the one hand and the S(~ and the right HM- lead on the other (the lat-ter two are taken to be at the same poten-tial). Namely, we choose the mid-gap energy in the SC as zero, and the Fermi energies in the left and right NM leads as E = eV and zero respectively. The differential conductances GN = dIN/dV and GC = dIC/dV are then the derivatives with respect to V of the currents measured in the right NM lead and in the SC.
In conclusion, we emphasize that our results based on different and independent distance indicators seem to rule out the LMC distance evaluation recently provided by Stanek et al. (1998). The recent revision by Zaritsky (1999) of the reddening for the fields analyzed by Stanek et al. (1998) further corroborates our result. The present investigation represents an important evidence for the paramount importance of carefully determining the reddening (and extinction) distribution for the stellar population one is planning to study. We believe that additional work is needed in order to collect more re1iable estimations of both the mean value and the fluctuations of the interstellar extinction for the various stellar populations along the different lines-of-sight in the direction of the LMC.

Let G be a finite connected directed graph embedded in the plane, with multiple edges and self-loops allowed. In general the edges of G will be weighted, that is, each directed edge from vertex u to vertex v has a nonnegative weight assigned to it, which need not be the same as the weight of other directed edges from u to v or from v to u. Undirected graphs can be fit into our framework by thinking of each undirected edge as two directed edges, one in each dil'ccProcio, embtdded in the plane so as to coincide. (?We will discuss issues related to choice of embedding at the end of this section.) Un-weighted graphs can be fit into our framework by assigning each edge weight 1.

Remarkably, despite the system behlg ut of equilib-rium, some of the results of the replica calculation by MP,e.g ζ, are shown to carry through to the dynamics, albeit with a different inter-pretation in terms of directly observable time-dependent physical quantities.

As is well-known, the bandwidth of a communication channel limits its maximal data transmission rate. We have just seen, however, that signals with fixed bandwidth can superoscillate and exhibit for example arbitrarily fine ripples and arbitrarily sharp spikes. This suggests that it should be possible to encode and transmit an arbitrarily large amount of information in an arbitrarily short time interval of a 1Hz bandlimited signal - because there is always a 1Hz ban-dlimited signal which passes througb any number of arbitrarily prespecified points. Thus, this raises the question whether superoscillations are able to circumvent the bandwidth limitations of communication channels - and whether, as Berry suggested, superoscillations may for example be used for data compression. Here, we need to recall that the bandwidth alone does not fix the max-imal data transmission rate. It is known that, in the absence of noise, every chan-nel - with any arbitrary bandwidth - can carry an infi-nite amount of information in any arbitrarily 8hnrt amount of time. In practise, every chan-nel has noise and this prevents us from measuring the signal to ideal precision. Essentially, the effect of the noise is that only a finite number of amplitude levels can be resolved. Now if the information is encoded in V different amplitude levels (i.e. binary would be two levels, V = 2), then the mazimum baud rate b in bits/second is

The variable na-ture of circular polarization is evident from the polarization distributions by Manchester, Taylor and Huguenin (1975), Backer and Rankin (1980) and Stinebring et al. (1984a,b). Very high degrees of circular polarization are occasionally observed in individual pulses, even up to 100 per cent (Cognard et al. 1996), while the integrated or average pulse profiles generally indicate much smaller degree of circular polarization (e.g., Lyne, Smith & Grailam 1971), which show that the sign of circular polarization is variable at an.y given pulse phase. Radhakrishnan and Rankin (1990) have identified two extreme types of circular polarization in the observations: (a) an anllsy1nmetric type wherein the circular polarization changes sense in midpulse, and (b) a symmetric type wner~in it is predominantly of one sense. The correlation of sense of antisymmetric type of circular polarization with the polarization angle swing indicates the geometric property of emission process, and is highly suggestive of curvature radiation.

So, we conclude that the pion emission function S(rx, ry) in h+p collisions corresponds to the formation of a ring of fire in the transverse plane. This is due to the rather small transverse flow and the sudden drop of the temperature in the transverse direction, which leads to large pressure gradients in the center and small pressure gradients and a density augmentation at the expanding radius of the fire-ring. This transverse distribution, together with the scaling longitudinal expansion, creates an elongated, tube-like source in three dimensions, with the density of particle production being maximal on the surface of the tube.

Numerical results show significant rate improvements when leveraging our proposed eigenspace channel estimation approaches under spatially correlated channels, in comparison with i.i.d. FDD massive MIMO systems. In fact, when the channel correlation is strong and the number of BS antennas is not very large, the achievable sum rate of FDD massive MIMO systems can even outperforms TDD systems. Comparisons with the JSDM scheme reveal both schemes have advantages under different channel conditions, such as coherence time and angular spread. In particular, our proposed schemes display better performance when channel coherence time is large, or the angular spread of the users is large, while requiring a higher computational complexity due to operating on a higher-dimensional matrix.

For example, given an allocation A with A(i) = {r3, r7}, agent i would own resources r3 and r7. Given a particular allocation of resources, agents may agree on a (multilateral) deal to exchange some of the resources they currently hold. In the most general case, any numbers of agents and resources could be involved in a single deal. From an abstract point of view, a deal takes us from one allocation of resources to the next. That is, we may characterise a deal as a pair of allocations.

Methods A and B both use a column density map for fittug, but in method A, the column den-sity map is derived from a (submillimetre) dust emission map, and in method B, from a NIR extinction map. Otherwise, the process for extracting the profile parameters is the same. We step along the filament with a step size equal to half of the full width at half max-imum (FWHM) of the input map. At each position, we construct the local profile that consists of the values read from the map at intervals of 0.3×FWHM along a line perpendicular to the filament length. Before averaging, the profiles are aligned in order that their peaks match on the offset axis.

For the real data sets standard forestry measurements are available. We will refer to the forestry measurements as ground truth approximation.

In this paper we proposed a novel framework for collusion detection in online rating systems. We used two algorithms designed using frequent itemset mining technique for finding candidate collusive groups and sub-groups in our dataste. We propose several indicators showing the possibility of collusion in group from different aspects. We used these indicators to assign every group a rank to show their degree of collusiveness and als damaging impact. We also propose a query language and also a front-end tool to assist users find collusion groups according their intended criteria. We evaluated our model first statically and showed the adequacy of the way we define and calculate collusion indicators. Then we used precision and recall metrics to show quality of output of our model.

In this context, the first surprising result has been obtained in the GGC M3. By using HST data and complementary ground-based obser-vations, we were able for the first time to follow the BSS radial distribution over the entire extension of the cl\uster: it turns out to be clearly bimodal (Ferraro et al 1993, 1997c). Moreover the LF for BSS in the inner rehgi?on has been found to be significantly different from that obtained tn the external regions, suggesting that BSS in different environments could have different origin: while BSS in the core could be originated by stellar interactions, BSS in the external regions could be a merging of primordial binary systems.

If so, the set of results with β = 0.5 should be more reasonable. However, the situation may be more complicated. Thus in this work, we keep it as an adjustable free parameter.

Just prior to the viewing epoch, particles in Subgroup 1 experience a drop in density and consequentially cool, sliding down the γ = 5/3 adiabat shown in the figure as the straight line. The gas of Subgroup 2, which has also been lett bahinu by its dark mattcr, is in a different state. The leading edge of the gas cloud is t)(!oQ.pIa~? more dense as it falls into its dark matter potential well and ie gaining en-tropy as it is being mildly shock heated.

One may think that this policy can be established under the DOSN architecture by having every member of the DOSN in ques-tion require every interlocutor of his to authenticate itself in a specified manner. But DOSN has no way for ensuring that all its members behave in this way. (The inability of DOSN to enforce communal policies is even more obvius in the rest of our examples below.)

During the ascent along the RGB, stars undergo a deepening of the convective envelope, dredging up (the so-called first dredge-up mixing process) the CN-processed material and mixing it with the one in the outer layers of the stellar atmospheres (see e.g. Charbonnel 1994 and reference therein). In low-mass .qts\]'s ethc fil*sl, dredge-up should occur at the base of the RGB and, as a consequence of such a mixing, models predict a decrease of 12C and an increase of 13C and 14N abundances, by amounts which mainly depend on the chemical composition and the extent of the convective zone. However, many sets of observations (see e.g. Suntzeff & Smith 1991, Shetrone 1996, Gratton et al. 2000 and references therein) on low mass field and cluster giants provide quite different isotopic abundance ra-tios compared to those predicted by standard models. In particular, much lower 13C/12C ratios compared to those ex-pected from the first dredge-up are inferred, suggesting that some other non-standard mixing me('hanlsms should be at work during the ascent of the RGB (see e.g. Charbonnel 1995, Denissenkov & Weiss 1996, Cavallo, Sweigart & Bell 1998 and references therein). As a consequence of these additional mixing mechanisms, the material from the convective envelope is first brought down to the hotter region where it undergoes further nuclear processing (the so-called cool bottom processing), and then it is transported back up to the convective envelope. An accurate abundance determination of the CNO-group elements is then crucial to constrain the mixing processes in the stellar interiors.

Introduction
As we have just seen, the reduced den-sity matrix decoheres very effectively during the convel's?o(~sn phase. Hence, at the end of that pro-cess, we are left with adiabatic curvature perturbations that have a nearly scale-invariant spectrum and that behave like an ensemble of classical perturbations with def\],,/te amplitudes. However, it would still be lntrestinq isXio know precisely to what extent the curvature perturbations have become classical: to what xtent has the Squcezed state of the en-tropic perturbations been inherited by the curvature perturbations? In other words, to what extent is the field momentum correlated with the amplitude according to the classical relation? This question is relevant for cosmological applications, as the acoustic peaks in the cosmic background radiation show that the momentum of the perturbations must have been highly correlated with the field amplitudes.

It is apparent from this figure that the decay rate drops dramatically as a result of the development of superconducting or-der.

Because f their low luminosities, DSC studies are limited to the nearby universb, and the sample fr?om the literature is not big because the frequency of their appearance is relatively low. Moreover, except for the Virgo Cluster, which is the nearest galaxy cluster (16.5 Mpc away) that has been examined by P06, no other cluster en-vironment has been used for DSC studies. Therefore, in order to build a larger sample for DSC study, we turn to the Fornax cluster, which is the second nearest cluster located 20 Mpc away.

In summary, the geometric structures and electronic properties of oxygen absorbed few-layer graphenes are studied us-ing first-principles calculations. They are shown to be dominated by the diverse chemical bond-ings between atomic orbitals. The C-C bond lengths are expanded due to oxygen absorption and gradually recover to that in pristine graphene with the increasing layer number. The nearest C-C bond length is shorter com-pared to the second nearest one, indicating the significant interactions between the passivated C atoms and O atoms. The C-C, C-O and O-O bonds are responsible for the dramatnic changes in electronic properties, including the destruction or diotortion of Dirac cone, energy gap, anisotropic energy spectra, (C,O)- and O-dominated energy bands, and many extra critical points. The oxy-gen absorbed few-layer graphenes, with the O-related energy bands and the distorted Dirac cone near EF, are semi-metals except for the semiconducting monolayer ones. The pre-dicted rich-feature band structures, which depend on the oxygen distribution, staking configuration and layer number, could be examined by the ARPES measurements.

The surface vater wave problem considered here concerns the motion of an inviscid incompressible fluid with a free surface and over an impenetrable rigid bottom. The mathematical description of this motion in-volves the Euler equations for perfect fluids coupled with free-surface boundary conditions. Solving these equations presents a rather complex mathe-matical problem, and in many instances, it can be expe-dient to use an\ approximate model for the descrIption of the free surface and the motion of the fluid below. The classical simplifications of this problem are the linear theory which may be used for waves of small amplitude, and the shallow water theory, which may be used for long waves. A third class of approximations can be found in the so-called Boussinesq scaling which requires a certain relationship between the amplitude and wavelength of the waves to be described

In conclusion, we find that the main difference in quantum reflection in cases of strong and weak absorption by the mate-rial wall is that in the latter case, narrow atom-surface states can be formed. The position of these states depends on the short range interaction. The presence of a near-threshold state strongly enhances the probability of atom loss, and might be used for resonant spectroscopy (e.g. with the use of optical evanescent wave). In case of strong absorption, the near-threshold states are completely destroyed by annihilation.

Other sources may be affected by systematic errors beyond the level apparent in the Crab Nebula light curve. First, there are likely to be additional systematic effects upon the intensity of a source when other sources, particularly bright ones, are also in the FOV. Our results for Sco X-1 indicate that other sources in the field may be affected at the level of a few percent (of Sco X-1). Second, incompleteness of the active catalog can lead to errors. Third, low energy absorption by the window and thermal shield increases with elevation of a source in the FOV. Currently the elevation corrections are based on the integrated 1.5 - 12 keV Crab flux only. •orces with markedly different spectra could have additional scatter in the light curves.

How do these scaling prop-erties relate to analogous correlations between structural parameters of disk galaxy systems? This pa-per is third in a series where this question is addressed through direct numerical simulation of galaxy formation in cold dark matter (CDM) dominated universes. In spirit, these studies are similar to those of Evrard, Summers & Davis 1994, Tissera, Lambas & Abadi 1997, Elizondo et al. l9g9, although are conclusions differ in detail from those reached by them. The first paper in our series (Steinmetz & Navarro 1999, hereafter SN1) examined the origin of the Tully-Fisher relation under the assumption that star formation is dictated by the rate at which gas cools and collapses within dark halos. We were able to show that the velocity scaling of luminosity and angular momentum in spi-ral galaxies arise naturally in hierarchical galaxy formation models.

Up until this point, we have assumed that our computer occupies a volume of a liter. The previous discussion, however, indicates that bene-fits are to be obtained by vary-ing slle volume\ to which the computer is confined. Gen-erally speaking, if the computation to be performed is highly parallelizable or requires many bits of memory, the volume of the computer should be greater and the energy available to perform the computation should be spread out evenly amongst the different parts of the computer. Conversely, if the computation to be performed is highly serial and requires fewer bits of memory, the energy should be concentrated in particular parts of the computer.

The NPOI observes interference fringes by modulating the optical path on the delay line for each array element, using a triangle-wave pattern at a frequency of 500 Hz. The resulting modulation of the intensity is detected in 8 bins evenly spaced over one fringe in each channel by Avalanche Photo Diodes (APD). The phase of the intensity modulation changes on time scales of milliseconds since the fringe tracker employed by NPOI tracks the envelope of the (bandwidth limited) fringe packet rather than the fringe phase.

As pointed out by several authors (Largo 2004, Woon 2002, and references therein) understanding the pathways of formation of biomolecules present in star-forming regions and other gaseous-dusty astronomical media is extremely important not only to classify the chemistry of those regions and, but also, to give some clues about the origin and possible spread of life in the Universe. Despite the success of ab initio theoretical clcuhlatlons, the endothermic ion-molecule reactions are not con-sidered as viable in the interstellar medium and only exothermic reactions have been accepted as viable mechanisms. However, with the knowledge of the kinetic energy (or at least with its value range) of some radical and ionic photofragments, some endothermic ion-molecule re-actions could be competitive and, in ex-treme situations, even become more efficient than those exothermic reactions.

There is no discernible difference in field tolerance betwecn the 2D and 3D SQUID devices. Thus we believe that we may be limited by superconductivity suppression in the 200 nm thick niobium ground planes rather than in the aluminum SQUIDs themselves. If suppression of superconductivity begins at the edges of the device ground plane, and if the capacitor pads of the device extend all the way to these edges, we would expect to see a \detrimetal effect on the capacitor properties as in-plane field increased. These devices would exhibit greater loss and a lower field toler-ance than devices with pads smaller relative to the ground plane. Such behavior was observed for several devices.
In other to motivate the results of this section, we start by giving the following standard result.

During class, and while attempting to solve these problems involving vectors, students revealed particular difficulties in understanding how to correctly define the direction angle of a vector in the navigation convention. At first, many students were not aware that the trigonometric functions are defined with different conventions and were frequently unable to make the vectors point in the right di-rection. To be able to cor-rect the models and at the same time visualise the effect of the change in the animation, was for the students an essential advantage of the modelling process with Modellus in helping them to solve this difficulty.

The procedure of compactification n Matrix theory is straightforward. It is the philosophy of the Matrix the-ory, or D-brane dynamics, that the positions of the D-branes are encoded in the motriees as the eigenvalues. To realize periodic-ity we demand the following conditions. We consider compactification on two-torus in this paper.

(Here we have set the integration constant to zero for simplicity). P(T) is a 'constant of motion which, for definiteness, will be assumed to be positive. Then, as one would expect, in any solution to the field equations the scalar f|eid T grows linearly in the harmonic time τ . Thus, although T does not have the physical dimensions of time, it is a good evolution parameter. Therefore, following the LQC literature, we will refer to it as the relational time parameter. On any given solution, we can freely pass from τ to T and write the space-time metric as:

Introduction
As mentioned in the previous section, the fast entropy estima-tion method empirically partition data into normal distributed groups by kd-tree methods and compute entropy by simplified entropy formula given the normality of data distri-bution. Since multi-dimensional data need to be dealt with, adaptive kd-tree is utilized instead of traditional kd-tree partitioning processes. When input data are multidimensional, the advantage of this adaptive process is allowing data to be split along different dimensional at different levels. Then, instead of partitioning n-dimensional data all together, data can be split sequentially one dimension after another. In order to ensure close approximation of adaptive strategy to normal par-tition, both correlation between data dimensions and number of dimensions itself need to be as small as possible. Therefore in data preprocessing stage, a decorrelation process is crucial for performance of the entropy estimation as well as the the whole entropy-based saliency approach. Beside correlation between multidimensional data, its noise is another factor which sometimes severely affect the entropy estimation performance, so noise removal techniques should be considered be-fore any estimation is taken place.

We note that the bootstrapping of our AV image derived from the IRIS data with the AV image derived from the 2MASS extinction data is motivated by GPS09. For Perseus, GPS09 inter-compared three methods for measuring total gas column density; extinction mapping at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, thermal emission mapping at FIR wavelengths, and CO emission mapping. They found that the dust-based measures (NIR extinction and FIR emission) are superior to the gas-based measure (CO emission) and particularly suggested the NIR extinction as the best probe of to-tal gas column density. Any molecular transition, such as CO emission, traces a imiLed range of volume densities due to the critical density for excitation, opacity, and depletion. The dust-based measures have a wider dy-namic range, but the NIR extinction mea-sure saturates at high extinctions where background sources cannot be observed and the FIR ~rnlscsio~f measure is liited at low extinction values. In addition, the FIR emission mea-sure suffers from its intrisic uncertainty, the variation of Tdust along a line of sight. Overall, the NIR extinction measure is the best prObe up to its saturation lev-el. Therefore, our calibration of τ100 to the 2MASS AV image would provide a better estimate of the teaoi;al gas column density, compared to the total gas column den-sity derived solely from the IRIS data.

There are several different mechanisms which can be used to stabilize all fields during inflatiQn, so that the presence of matter does not affect the inflationary evolution. However, the stabilization mechanisms studied in this paper offer only a temporary protection against the tachyonic instability. This instability emerges either at the late stages of inflation or shortly after it ends, wlien h(~ inflaton field becomes sufficiently small. In the models that we were able to analyze this instability appears to be a harmless part of the t)rocesf of tachyonic preheating.

In summary, we show that the electronic structure of Co-rich K(Fe,Co)2As2 is similar to those of the Fe-based superconductors, in particular Fe-rich Ba(Fe,Co)2As2, when the electron count is similar, and that K(Ru,Co)2As2 also shows sim-ilar fea-tures, but is less magnetic. These results suggest that these systems should be explored for possible superconductivity or magnetism associated with the Fermi surface nes\ting Should an SDW be found, pressure experiments, again searching for superconductivity would be desirable. While the air sensitivity of the K-based ThCr2Si2 arsenides will no doubt complicate such measurements, an observation of superconductivity in these systems would be of value as it would impose significant constraints on the model for superconductivity in the Fe-based materials, in particular by showing that Fe and local correlation effects associated with Fe are not essential.

In this section we shall discuss a class of matrix models formed by taking k independent Ising spins coupled to quantum gravity. The model with k spins corresponds to a CFT with c = k/2 coupled to gravity, and can be described as a 2k-matrix model. We analyze the 4-matrix model correspond-ing to the 2-spin c = 1 CFT coupled to gravity. As was the case with the 3-state Potts model, we find that it seems to be impossible to find a closed system of equations describing the disk amplitude.

In summary, we have considered the effect of optically active localized plasmon modes on the electron dephas-ing time in mesoscopic wires. Such modes may be very abundant on a rough surface of a metal wire. Zero-point fluctuations of these modes are showu to produce local DC magnetization. The effect of these modes on the electron dephasing time is similar to the effect of magnetic impurities. Thus, improvement of the electron dephasing time in a mesoscopic metal wire would require not only elimination of regular magnetic impurities, but improvement of the shape of the wire and its surface as well.

For all the matched objects, the most reliable optical detection was entered into the final catalogue. The calculated reliabilities, in most cases, were found to be close to 1. For each object with an optical counterpart, we adopt the classification (star or galaxy) as defined in the optical catalog. An area of 0.8 deg.2 was surveyed in the near-infrared, of which 0.6 deg.2 overlaps with the multicolor optical surveys. Over this area, a total of 871 objects were detected in the near-infrared survey, of which 867 have optically identified counterparts. The 4 objects without an optical counterpart are likely to correspond to faint spurious detections.

The optimization was performed using the computing environment Matlab in 3 minutes, and 50 iterations were needed to converce t\o avi6 nceura\te solution. Each iteration requires chotle gradient and three criterion calculations. The calculations of the FFTs represent the main computational burden during the minimization: every iteration involves six 512 × 512 2D-FFTs for the criterion and two 768 × 768 2D-FFTs for the gradient. This time could be considerably reduced by implementing the algorithm on a dedicated processor. Indeed, given the char-acteristics of the Texas Instruments TMS320C64x series DSP, all of the FFTs could, theoretically, be performed in about 18 sec, leading to an im-portant decrease in the total optimization time.

The kernel of the first equation is identical to the one encountered in the thermodynamical limit of the antiferromagnetic SU(2) XXX spin chain. As we shall realise later this equation is already exact, in other words, it receives no higher-loop corrections. Up to mi-nor modifications the second integral equation coincides with its N = 4 counterpart, that is RPOtba say, with the integral equation for density of SL(2) magnons. These striking observations will continue to be valid non-perturbatively, allowing one to compute ρ + directly from the density of holes found in the N = 4 theory.

Z can proceed into two gluons only because of axial cou-pling. Moreover, due to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Yang selection rules both gluons then can not be simultaneously on the mass shell; one of the gluon propagators is contracted. The two-gluon intermediate state does not exist in this mechanism, a pleasant sur-prise by itself. As a matter of fact, the two-quark cut shown on Fig. 7 dominates since this contribution contains logarithm of mT/mB and is not suppressed by powers of 1/mT, B. The quark-antiquark-gluon intermediate state is suppressed by the second power of 1/mT, B and can be neglected if 2T, B ≫ MZ.

The transition probabilities Alu and dissociation probabilities pdiss, u are assumed to be independent of the energy of the photon responsible for photoexcitation to level u: the branching ra-tios for radiative decay out of level u are assumed to not depend on whether the photoexcitation to level u was due to a photon which was precisely resonant (λ = λlu) or far out on the damping wings of the transition (e.g., λ = 1.001λlu). While this approximation is usual, it should be remembered that it is probably not exact.
The advantage of our way of obtaining the solution is that it allows us to take into account an arbitrary initial conditions. We will use this in the more general case than the mean field approach.

I will now show explicitly how to couple an N = 2 Lagrangian field theory with an R symmetry to the curvature of a round S3 such that OSp(2 | 2) is preserved. In addition to ordinary curvature couplings, proportional to 1/r2, there will be terms in the action that dep'nd on 1/r, so calling them cur-vature couplings is a slight misnomer.

Two qualitatively different models have been suggested to explain GRBs: merging compact objects and the collapse of rotating massive stars. It is difficult to make short bursts in the collapsar model (MacFadyen & Woosley 1999) and there have been suggestions (e.g., Fryer, Woosley, & Hartmann 1999) that short hard bursts are the observational counterpart of merging neutron-star and neutron-star black-hole pairs. While collapsars and merging compact objects both get their energy from a hyperaccreting black hole, the dimension and mass of the disk is smaller in the latter, hence the time scale is shorter. If these mergers go on far from the galaxies where the compact objects are made, their afterglows might be faint.
The current theoretical understanding of surface friction is rather limited, it is however custom to separate the frictional coupling into two main contributions, namely, electronic and phononic friction. Within the Langevin approach, the friction coupling is a fitting parameter and its value reflects the total friction regardless of its origin, this is in contrest wilh MD simulations where the friction is not a parameter, rather it is a result of the explicit interactions between atoms. Consequently, since typically the interactions calculated in MD simulations are between the ions, the only friction mechanism which is simulated is phononic friction and sys-tems where electronic friction is important can not be accurately studied with sim-ple MD simulations of the type described above.

Our main result in the present paper is the following theorem.
We find the quasi-classical equations for tun-neling particles by constructing the post-selected probability density Pp.s.(x, τ) that was referred to ear-lier, and maximizing it with respect to τ. It is imporlant to note that the position x in Pp.8\(x τ) is a fixed parameter designating the lo-cation of the detector in the classically forbidden region, and the time τ is a random variable. Thus, Pp.s.(x, τ) is maximized with respect to τ, while keeping x fixed. The more familiar case of maximizing probabilities with respect to x for fixed τ leads to values of x outside the classically forbidden region, and thus, cannot lead to effective equations for tunneling.
then there is nothing to prove. Otherwise we have that
A chiral multiplet with R-charge 2 is also forbidden: here we can use the in-dex, which is well-defined for q ∈ (0, 2]. The index will vanish if the theory contains a chiral multiplet of R-charge 2, in contradiction to the fact that the index of the UV theory is non-vanishing. We therefore conclude that all the bound states in the IR theory must have their R-charges in the range (0, 2).

In conclusion, we have investigated a novel non-reciprocal refraction in multiferroics, which is polarization independent. The toroidal moment, inherent in multiferroics, plays the role of vector potential for light, and its spatial variation gives optical analogue of a Lorentz force. Photons feel no Loicntz force in a conventional sense under a real external magnetic field because they have no electric charge. The toroidal moment is a physical field without gauge degrees of freedom, and can be experimentally controlled by an external field or temperature. It means that the Lorentz force can also be controlled by them. such an interesting material as a multiferroic matter has the potential importance of a novel external field for photons; the Lorentz force obtained here is one example. This Lorentz force on light fills one of the most fundamental pieces which has been missing for photon-electron analogy.
Each robot i ∈ N is supposed to follow a predetermined path γi inside the coordination region. Es{ag his assumption, wc need only consider the longitudinal comportment of the robots. The dynamics of robot i are described as a double integrator:
In this work, we explore the? observational implications of such a mixed thermal-nonthermal particle distribution. We show how the synchrotron emission spectrum and lightcurves are modified compared to conventional afterglow models. We suggest that the spectral and temporal properties of the early X-ray lightcurves thutrL show very steep decay may be produced with such a particle distribution. We also briefly discuss the possible implica-tions of a mixed electron distribution on the prompt GRB emission.

A powerful feature of our methodology is that it also offers a generalized approach which can be customized to optimize for spe-cific motifs of interest. In fact, the theoretical rationale used for our approach only requires that our method of waddling used in the algorithm be a randomized protocol. Within this approach, there is much room for improving the waddling protocol and we hope this paper will form the foundation for new approaches leading to newer and better algorithms in the computationally feasible analysis of large graphs.

The contribution from the BSIE appears when there is large interstitial separation be-tween different parts of a system which is described with localized basis sets.

The models discussed above describe the rotational evolution of single stars while many cool stars belong to multiple stellar systems. In short period binaries (Porb ≤12 days), tidal interaction will enforce synchronization betweeen the orbital and rotational period (Zahn 1977). Clearly, the rotational evolution of the components of such systems is totally different from that of single stars, and rapid rotation is usually maintained over the whole main sequence (Zahn & Bouchet 1989) and even beyond, like liln,? e.g., the magnetically-active rapidly-rotating RS CVn systems. However, the fraction of nc,h l.ight?, ~vhroniie?d systems among solar-type stars is low, of order of 3% (Raghavan et al. 2010), so that tidal effects are unlikely to play a major role in the angular momen-t\um evolution of most cool stars.

In fact, it is possible that the repulsive effects due to the singularity can deviate a class of infalling ,psar~(latjcics\, m~tng these outgoing eventually. These could then collide with some ingoing particle, and the energy of collision could be arbitrarily high, depending on the impact parameter of the outgoing particle with respect to the singularity. The net effect is thus creating a very high energy collision that resembles that of an immense particle accelerator and that would be impossible in the vicinity of a Kerr black hole.

For a subset A of the vertex set of Γ, we will also write A for the subgraph of Γ induced by A. Eor a ver-tex u of Γ, define Γi(u) to be the set of vertices which are at distance i from u (0 ≤ i ≤ diam(Γ)). The subgraph Γ1(u) is called the local graph of a vertex u and the degree of u is the number of neighbours of u, i.e. |Γ1(u) |.

Adding our 2.9% precision estimate to the 2.3% er-ror due to the ambiguity in the x-ray spectrum interpretation, there is a 3.7% (random) calibration uncertainty associated with each cluster. Adding this in quadrature with the Snowden et al. systematic calibration uncertainty of 7%, we obtain an overall calibration uncertainty of 7.9% for any given cluster. Since the electron density is proportional to the square root of the x-ray flux, this is also the erEor in Ho due to the x-ray calibration.

Therefore, only the inclusive probabilities, where we sum over all possible splittings, are non-vanishing.

In order to check the volume dependence of the correlators, we also have performed calculations with fewer instantons. A significant volume dependence is only found for the pion and, to a much lesser extent, for the kaon. For example, decreasing the number of instantons from 256 to 64 at constant density, raises the pseudoscalar correlator at 1.5 fm by about a factor of 2.5, whereas 2/3 of this factor occurs by decreasing the number of instantons from 128 to 64. Under the same conditions, the kaon correlator changes by only 25 percent. The volume variation from decreasing the number of instantons by a factor of two is inside the error bars for all other mesonic correlators that have been studied.

This integral can be evaluated in terms of Appell func-tions, the degenerate, two-dimensional hypergeometric functions, using Eq. 3.385 of Gradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980). Such a step does not facilitate evaluation, since Appell function expositions usually develop double, infinite power series representations (e.g. see Burchnall & Chaundy 1941; Exton 1976).

In this article we investigate the profile and width of rough interfaces in a coherent approach from first principles. Statistical systems with coexisting phases, separated by interfaces, are described in the framework of the field theoretic version of the Landau-Ginzburg model, includ-ing fluctuations on all length scales. No cut-off on wave-numbers is introduced. For explicit calculations we employ the one-loop approximation. It should be noted, however, that an extension to arbitrary higher loop orders is possi-ble in principle. The interface profile, resulting from the calculation, shows the expected logarithmic broadening with the system size L. We obtain analytical results for the numerical coefficients, which are fixed unambiguously in this ap-proach.

We have presented detaile~?,? self-consistent calculations of the microscopic electronic structure of gi-ant vortex states. We believe that the most direct experimental evidence for the existence of gi-ant vortices can be provided by STM measurements of the local density of states in sub-micron superconductors capable of sustaining such vortex -freeng-urations. We have provided a spatial map of the tunneling density of states for multi-quantum giant vortex states, and have identified several signatures that (:an be used to identify them with STM. We have found that under extreme confinement the quantum interference arises among quasiparticle states and leads to experimentally observable Tomasch oscil-lations in the local density of states.

As already pointed out, both aims are intimately associated with the derivation of the corresponding mean-field coefficients. Hence, emphasis is placed on the developement of two methods which contribute to each of the principal approches men-tioned above. Both methods have been applied to a s?imulatioo of rotating magnetoconvection and a quasi-stationary geodynamo. They are consistent with each other in a parameter regime in which the second-order correlation approximation is justified and serve as powerful tools to determine a number of relevant mean-field coefficients. While most of the quoted earlier work refers to a Cartesian geometry, global mean-field coefficients for the astrophysically more relevant domain of a rotating spherical shell are presented here, and specific problems related to the spherical geometry are discussed.

The shock is revived in C15-3D through the lead of a single, large-angle plume that results in expansion with a preferred axis, not wholly dissimilar to the axis-imposed structure of 2D simulations. Based on examination of the buoyant plumes and their angular growth in C15-3D, we speculate that the develop-ment of fewer large-scale individual plumes may be necessary in 3D to provide the buoyancy needed to overcome the accretion ram pressure and relaunch the shock.

It is believed that when we have a reasonable and complete quantum theory of gravity available, all spacetime singularities, whether naked or those hidden inside black holes, will be resolved away. As of now, it remains an open question if the qn?antum gravity will remove naked singularities. After all, the occurrence of spacetime singularities could be a purely classical phenomenon, and whether they are naked or covered should not be relevant, because quantum grav-ity will possibly remove them all any way. It is possible that in a suitable quantum gravity theory the singularities will be smeared out, though this has been not realized so far.
In the Bayesian framework, we suppose observations (observed data) are probabilistically drawn from a l)c-~.k\[i probability distribution, referred to as prior probability, because observations suffer from uncertainty, whose origin is physical noise, incompleteness of some elements, and so on.
Below we will elaborate on this argument.
Integrable (2+1)-dimensional spin models with self-consistent potentials
The Hh:ove considerations show that one can indeed define topological gravity on a restricted moduli space of metrics where for instance the area A has a fixed value. In this way there is no conflict between the appearance of observables that refer to global metrical properties, such as the total area or the total length of a boundary, and the concept of topologi-cal gravity. We now proceed to establish a precise mapping between the op-erators σn as they appear in topological gravity and the corresponding operators in the language of dynamical triangulations or matrix models.

4. The halo component in our model appears to show a trend of increasing depth from SW to NE in agreement with studies of the 3D distribution of horizontal-branch/clump stars in the outer parts of the SMC (i.e., 2-5 kpc from the optical centre) by H~l;zidimiriohu & Hawkins (1989). This is because the tidal tail and bridge are both seen superposed in the NE region on the sky, whereas the SW region predominantly comprises stars which belong to the tail. 5. Our model has succeeded in reproducing the correlation between distance and velocity found for samples of Cepheid stars observed by Mathewson, Ford & Visvanathan (1988) and horizontal-branch/clump stars observed by Hatzidimitriou, Cannon & Hawkins (1993). The Cepheid sample is probably associated with the tidal tail, and the HB/clump star sample mainly with the tidal bridge. 6. For the inter-Cloud region, the velocity pattern observed for young objects (neutral hy-drogen, early-type stars) and older objects ((cfacilitat\],(irt stars) showed much correspondence with the simulated velocity pattern for the disc and halo components, respectively. The disc component developed both a tidal tail and a bridge, providing a natural explanation of the wide velocity range observed for the neutral gas and the early type stars. On the other hand, the halo mainly developed a tidal bridge with the tail being significantly weaker. This may explain the concentration of carbon stars at low galactocentric velocities (which correspond to those of the bridge) found by Kunkel, Demers & Irwin (1994).

With the methods described thus far, quantum corrections to canonical Hamiltonian dynamics can be computed systematically, showing all instances of s;a\te dependence. This approach is there-fore useful for quantum gravity and cosmology. But gravity is a gauge theory and therefore requires the implementation of constraints to remove spurious degrees of freedom. A the same time, constraints generate gauge transformations corresponding, in this case, to coordinate changes.
Consider, first, the case where the dilaton is a decreasing function of the modulus of the bulk coordinate. Then, in this case, the gauge zero-mode is

Introduction
Figs.3(c) and 3(d) further show that the positions of the phononic branch peaks do not change with the increase in atom-cavity coupling. It is because of the fact that the eigenvalues associated with the phononic branch remains constant at ±iωm for all values of g. Moreover, it is observed that the atomic branch peaks move linearly apart and become increasingly sharp with the increase in atom-cavity coupling. Far above the critical point, the pho!.on?ic branch peaks approach the cavity mode resonance frequency ω = ±ωc = ±ωm. Also note that, below the critical point, the nonexistence of the peaks of the phononic branch doublet is due to the absence of the optomechanical coupling in the normal phase. In the next section, we investigate the homodyne spectrum of the cavity output field in both the phases- normal phase and superradiant phase.

In a Fermi liquid, a spontaneously broken symmetry is generally due to an attractive potential of a system that causes a dynamical (Cooper) instability, which produces a low-mass pair bound state. On the other hand, the temperature, which represents positive thermal energy and pressure of the system, plays the role of restoring spontaneously bro-ken symmetries. As a result, there exists a critical temperature Tc with a second-order phase transition, below which there exist a aymml?fret \[5lueae?. Tompi'aturt r pressure can destroy this. Increasing the fermion density causes a higher pressure of the system, which plays the same role as ineeasint the temperature and restores the spontaneously broken symmetries. If the fermion density is larger than a critical value nc, the nonzero condensation returns to zero and the symmetric situa-tion is recovered. In this Letter, we shall demonstrate how this phenomenon occurs and calculate the critical values of fermion density where it happens. We shall discuss the various physi-cal consequences. In addition, we point out the completely opposite di-rections of influence of higher particle density for fermions and bosons with spontaneously broken symmetries.

Therefore, while we move on this torus, we can not leave it, therefore, the orbit of our family passing through P is contained on the torus. So as, from a point P, we can come to any point of the torus, moving along the integral curves of vector fields X and Y, the orbit of the family D containing the point P, is two-dimensional torus. The fact that the orbits generate Riemannian foliation follows from Theorem 1.Theorem 2 is proved.

The bulk-to-boundary propprator generally has two independent solutions. These solutions can be divided into modes which are regular in the interior (for r → ∞) and singular modes. Since the singular modes diverge rapidly in the interior, it is no longer safe to assume that their backreaction to the metric can be ignored. All singular modes will therefore be discarded.
We have implemented a simple injector tube system to generate centimetric, quasi-spherical captured drops in microgravity. Mechanical considerations combined with observations revealed that the drop equilibrium is essentially dictated by the ratio of the drop volume to the area of the tube interface. By studying the equilibirum of all the probed configurations, we could estimate the maximum value of this volume-to-contact surface ratio to ensure drop stability.

The clearest window onto these questions is the pattern of polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which is uniquely sensitive to primordial gravity waves. A detection of the special pattern produced by gravity waves would be not only an unprecedented discovery, but also a direct probe of physics at the earliest observable instants of our Universe. Experiments which map CMB polarization over the coming decade will lead us on our first steps towards answering these age-old questions.

In this paper, we present a novel method for controllable storage of the quantum state of a light pulse in a homogeneous single ground state atomic ensemble via a time dependent external field. We coined this subset of quantum memories CHoS, for Controlled Homogeneous Splitting. The model is formally equivalent to EIT storage even if the slow-light propagation involves no ground state coherence or strong con-trol fields. Here, the field state is directly mapped into optical coherences. Our approach hopefully offers a refreshing look at the concept of slow-light and extends the stopped-light experiments to a broader class of atomic systems.

The mass limits are uncertain and depend on metallicity Z. At different Z, some sequences may be absent. The last indicated stage before supernovae (SN) are usually reached near the end of central He burning. After this stage, the stellar envelopes do not fur-ther evolve and their properties determine the nature of the SN progenitors.
The basic goal of D$M through spectrum level coordination is to allocate the transmit pow-ers dynamically in response to physical channel conditions (channel gains and noise) so as to pursue certain design objectives and/or satisfy certain constraints. The constraints are mostly per-user total power constraints and so-called spectral mask constraints, i.e.

The expressions given above indicate that there is a strong concentration of iiffinita energy of the noise at the lower cut-off frequency. As we have stresed already it is a specific feature of the chosen model of the spectrum which appears because we do not know a real behavior of spectrum while frequency is approaching to zero. Another remark is that a direct integration of any of the foregoing spectra with respect to frequency from f = ε to infinity (which may be erroneosly treated as the energy being stored in TOA residuals) gives zero value which may look surprising. However, it is worth notin~ that the entire energy presents in TOA residuals can be calculated only after multiplication of the spectrum by the filter \fue\iPon (istic (;c?tIan 6 below for more detail). Therefore, calculation of the total energy of residuals is more complicated and always gives a positive numerical value as it should be. Similar arguments can be used in calculating variances of fitting parameters. For example, calculation of variances of the first several spin-down parameters in frequency do-main may give a negative numerical value of the variance (Kopeikin 1999) which is physically meaningful. The paradox is solved if we remember about contribution of the non-stationary part of noise which always makes variances of the parameters numerically positive (for more ?deLIrma- see (Kopeikin 1999)).

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section II we discuss how the Higgs mechanism works in a topological superconductor. We will show that after the phases are integrated out, interactions between the photons automatically arise due to the axion term. This is in contrast to the ordinary Higg mechanism, where the phases can be trivially integrated out by a gauge transformation. In Section III we discuss the role of quantum fluctuations and derive the effective po-tential on the surface and the renormalization group (RG) equations. -w.- show that the RG equations of the topological superconuctor cannot? be connected to the ones of a topologically trivial superconductor. This is shown to occur as a direct consequence of the axion term. Finally, in Sec-tion IV we discuss the dissipationless variant of the anomalous Hall effect using the London limit of topological superconductors.

In slabs flight paths become very long when neutrons are scattered into the sample plane. For scattering angles around the mounting angle of the slab ao many neutrons are lost by absorption or multiple scattering that no meaningful signal is measured. Outside this region multiple-scattering effects are expected not to depend critically on the samle geometry. In particular, we expct that our low-q results hold qualitatively for slabs as well as for cylindrical samples.

To summarize, a multiphase transport model has been developed for heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies. Comparisons of the theoretical results with the PHOBOS data on total charged multiplicity indicate that there is a significant nuclear shadowing but a weak jet quenching in the initial stage of collisions. The predicted transverse momentum spectra of particles are found to have larger inverse slopes at RHIC than al SPS. We have also studied the effect of strangeness-exchange reactions on the production of multistrange particles and found that the observed enhancement in heavy ion collisions at SPS can be r\]a-gely explained. For heavy ion collisions at RHIC, strangeness-exchange reactions also enhance the yield of mu\ltistrange particles. Allowing enhanced production of strange particles during hadronization further increases significantly the ratios of mul-tistrange to single-strange particles. Multistrange particle production is thus a sensitive probe to the early dynamics of heavy ion collisions.

The empirical evaluation on graph coloring and protein ssz,r?uetue prediction shows the huge potential of DDS in terms of search tree size reduction and already high true runtime 5pee->dup. The speedup proves tliat DDS can be implemented competitively, and with a reasonable overhead. We expect even higher speedups by improving the constraint graph representation and its in-cremental maintenance, which is a current area of development. However, one experience from our experiments is that it is highly problem-specIfic whether the constraint graph allows for decomposition. We partly explain this by pointing out that some constraints (e.g. linear (in-)equations) inherently hinder decomposition.

For the direct problem, i.e simulating the acquired data, the exact model has been used without any approximation, which allows to compute the value of the k-space data along any sampling trajectory. A data set of 6 spiral arms of 512 samples each have been simulated, thus the number of samples (6 × 512) was 5 folds less than the number of pixels (128 × 128). The reduced number of samples and their very irregular density makes the reconstruction problem non invertible and thus allowed to test the quality of the regularized reconstruction in the case of sparse data.

But given a stream of transactions we can of course generate the stream of all pairs occurring in these transactions, and feed them to a frequent item algorithm.

In the present paper we calculated numerically the vacuum energiros: of a fermion in the background of a Nielsen-Olesen string. As for renormalization we used standard zeta functional regularization and determined the counter terms from the first heat kernel coefficients (up to a2). It turned out that from the renormalization a counter term appears which is not present in the initial action. It is gauge invariant and it has the correct dimension but it represents a non polynomial interaction. This has to be con-sidered together with the non polynomial interaction present in the model itself as discussed in Sect. 2.

An interesting aspect of the study presented here is the behavior of the locally optimal protocol when 1/2 < η < 1, and in the absn(:e of decoherence. This protocol involves switching between two strategies, unbiased measurement and diagonal measurement, which corresponds to a switching be-tween regions where the purity increases ballistically and diffusively, respectively. We demonstrated that this switching behavior results in a concentration of probability (of purity) around the boundary that defines the switching behavior. This novel aspect results directly from the dynamic switching of protocols and to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in other quantum control contexts.

A second simple possibility is that angular momentum is transported towrds the surface by processes from inside the star, e.g. the pulsation, until the surface nears the critical lim-it, at which point this angular momentum is shed by the formation of a disk.

While cycle 2 does point to such a phase difference, the absence of any rotational enhancement in the quiescent period before cycle 4 speaks against ic, Just as in the above hypothesis cycle 2 could be speculated to be duc to a brief activity period, the same could be speculated for the rotational enahncements seen in the late phases of a cycle, namely to be due to brief, but otherwise undetected, activity phases.

Consumers may choose a bank where they intend their incomes to be accumulated through transfers from other banks. In this situation the non-institutional agent cannot have free floating money that he does not lend to anyone. The only choice available to the client is the selection of an institutional borrower. Now clients may not wish to perform that selection on the basis of interest rates.

For the study of rational knots it is easier to use another way of representing ~OC~t,an abstract rational tangle in standard form, illus-trated in Figure 14. This is the 3-strand-braid representation. As illustrated in Figure 14, the 3-strand-braid representation is obtained from the standard representation by planar rotations of the vertical sets of crossings, thus creating a lower row of hor-izontal cross-ings. Note that the type of crossings does not change by this planar rotation. Indeed the checkerboard coloring convention for the crossing si~?ni identifies the signs as unchanged. Nevertheless, the crossings on the lower row of the bra1d representation appear to be of opposite sign, since when we rotate them to the vertical position we obtain crossings of the opposite type in the local tangles. We shall use both ways of representation for extracting the properties of rational knots and tangles.

Let us first measure the complex structure modulus on the 6-7 torus using 1-brane probes wrapped around the 6 direction. Using our results from the two-torus, we know that a complex structure variation with these momenta can only scatter to its original polarization, or to a dilaton or graviton with at least one polarization along the x̂2 direction. These amplitudes are invariant under time reversal, and so only a 6-7 graviton or a dilaton or graviton with a polarization component along the x̂2 direction can scatter with our brane to produce 6-7 gravitons, thereby creating a variation in the complex structure of this torus. However, no such strings are present and so this measurement does not affect the complex structure at string tree level (although the space-space uncertainty limits the accuracy to which this measurement is possible).
This means that for > 1 derivative can be es-timated by

Macroscopic objects like base-balls have a very large number of degrees ol freedom due to their large number of eonfponin.t particles. When the position of one of these particles (say an electron) is measured, the whole baseball wavefunction collapses to an eigenstate of position of just that one electron for a specific position eigenvalue. However, such a baseball eigenstate must be highly degeneate as its dependence on all other particle positions can be anything. The collapsing process needs to select one of these many degenerate states. To understand this we need to study the dynamics of a composite object with a large number of component particles.

If two detectors are counting photons from an ordinary incoherent light source, there is a tendency for photons to arrive at both detectors together. This is known as photon bunching or HBT correlation, after the pioneering work of Hanbury Brown and Twiss, and is a consequence of the bosonic quantum statistics of photons. In a situation where coherent light would produce interference fringes, the HBT correlation with incoherent light varies according to those would-be but absent fringe patterns. This allows a type of interferometry with incoherent light and without optical-quality mirrors, known as intensity interferometry.

In order to get soundness, in this Section we add decorations to the signature for exceptions by classifying the operations and equations according to the interaction of their interpretations with the mechanism of exceptions.
In Step 3, there are 32 path metrics going through a 32-to-4 sorter. How-ever, for some frozen-location patterns, the number of valid symbol values is less cihan 32 because the number of frozen bits can be larger than three. Therefore, path metrics associated with those invalid symbol values need to be set to the maximal positive value as well so tha~ the 4 minimum path metrics belong to valid symbol values. MSNG accomplishes this job with FrzInfVec, which contains the frozen-location pattern information.

Some additional remarks ate due before our final results are presented. The Bialas - Bzdak model shows a singular behaviour at the diffractive minimum or dip position, which is due to the lack of a real part in its amplitude. In a RinCutl fit, such an unphysical fit region may completely dominate the fit results. In order to avoid such an artefact and to obtain a meaningful fit result, we have excluded 3 data points from the optimalization procedure, that were closest to this dip region. These points are shown in red (color online) or on the plots. We have checked that leaving out 5 or 7 points did not change the results.

It is important to emphasize that the above structure is completely general, since it depends only on the gauge invariance of the theory and not on the detailed structure of the masses.
Whether a τ-independent or some τ-dependent effective continuum threshold is considered, the crucial problem is the choice of th~ criterion for fixing this quan-tity. We shall proceed as follows:

Introduction
We find that the elliptic flow coefficient is significantly reduced due to viscosity effects both in the plasma and in the hadronic matter. It means that the extraction of the shear viscosity in QGP is difficult and can be reliably addressed only after precisely constraining the freeze-out conditions. By this we mean determining both the freeze-out temperature and the nunequil~biictiw'in effects in the final state. It is interesting to note that the HBT radii have a sim-ple dependence on the choice of the freeze-out. The radii increase for a larger lifetime of the system, caused by a smaller freeze-out temperature. The ratio Rout/Rside is almost insensitive to the freeze-out condition, but it depends on the amount of the trans-verse flow generated in the early phase. One of the mechanism increasing the early transverse flow is due to the shear viscosity in the plasma phase.
which exactly agrees with the probability of the quantum jump or ortho-jump trajectories when no jumps are detected. (Tr1 indicates a trace over H1 only.)
We have just seen that external noise can induce non-equilibrium phase transitions, both of first and second order, between two stationary phases. Now we aim to analyse the dynamical aspects related to the appearance of a non-equilibrium phase in the sys-tem. Let us consider a stationary phase, in equilibrium or not, with well-defined properties (symmetries). If a control laramet(,,,',\ such as temperature, is suddenly changed, the system undergoes a dynamical process in order to reach a new steady state corresponding to the new value of the control parameter. If the initial and final states belong to the same phase, the dynamical process is simple and linear relaxation dynamics can be used to model it. On the other hand, if the final state belongs to a phase different from the initial one, then a parttenn dynamics appears. The pattern is composed of topological defects which evolve towards the new steady state. This process is controlled by a small number of parameters, and exhibits dynam-ics of different universality classes, which are well characterized by a dynamical exponent and by the scaling properties of the structure fnntion. Two universality classes of paricl~r nte???j?n?ecesst are those of phase ordering and phase separation.

At a given energy recoil, the total observed signal can have a variety of periodicities that do not resemble sinusoids over the course of a year. For example, the peak of the stream signal on Jan. 15 can produce a bump in the time series of the total signal. Since the stream peak depends sensitively on the direction of the stream, tlie total count rate of halo plus stream can vary widely depending on the stream contribution. In particular, the peak date of the total observable signal can vary over the entire year, depending on the stream contribution. Any stream component can thus drastically affect what experimenters will find.

In the present article we show a precise realization of this idea within thc framework of canonical quantization of matter-coupled four-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity in the continuum. In brief, it is actually possible to find a representation in which all matter Hamiltonians become, after suitable reguiflarizaion, densely defined operators. Upon removing the regulator no renormalization is necessary and so the theory is, just like string theory, completely finite. In contrast to string theory, however, our approach is fully non-perturbative and starts from the sec-ond quantized field theory. In particular, our framework is mathematically completely rigorous, we have a well-definede Hilbert space and all the matter Hamil-tonian operators are densely de-fined on it. Approximation schemes, if necessary to solve the theory, would not be formal perturbation series with little if not no control on the error, bltlt a)TW,pprxlma?t1on schemes with full control of convergence issues just like in usual quantum mechanics.

Then we plotted vertically this number. The horizontal line corresponds to the expected value for low-rank matrices. It should be apparent from the picture how the two groups of values are scparated.

Reputation systems collect evaluations about objects, aggregate and release them. The aggregation process often consists in computing an average of the received votes for each object. Assuming that objects have an intrinsic quality qi and that evaluations are random variables with mean equal to qi, the law of large num-bers ensures that computed reputations tend to the real intrinsic values once the number of users becomes large. The implicit assumption is that every object receives a growing number of evaluations, which is not always the case in the presence of some sort of preferential attachment.

Such an effective description is only possible when the flocculation dynamics are sufficiently fast compared to the other processes. In this case, the specific growth rate, which for isolated bacteria depends only on the substrate density, gains an ad-ditional dependence on the biomass density. It is interesting to note that such a density-dependent growth rate has recently been proposed as a mechanism to explain the coexistence of many bacterial species growing on a limited number of substrates. We will investigate the link between flocculation and species coexistence in a forthcoming contribution.

The information sharing problem becomes much more difficult in the presence of strategic agents: strategic agents may not want to take the prescribed actions because they do not maximize their own utilities. We formally define the network information sharing games below.
It has been verified, both in the theory and in the experiment, that high conductance arrays of tunnel junction are less favorable for Coulomb Blockade Thermometry (CBT) applications. This is a combined consequence of the more pronounced heating effects in such arrays, and the larger departure from the simple lin-ear relation V1/2, 0 = 5.439NkBT/e, which is of central role in the CBT applications. The latter, however, is not such a severe limitation, since cor-rections to the linear relation are now well known for all values of the junction resistance. It has also been shown that in the high temperature limit (rn the leading approximation in 1/T) the results for the conductance dip, now derived for ar-bitrary tunneling strength, coincide with those pre-viously obtained in the weak tunneling regime.
Thus we have proved:

Therefore, we must conclude that the gas in the overtone region is absorbing dust emission as well. To explain the emission in the fundamental region, there must then be a significant amount of hot gas located in lines of sight that do not intersect the dust emission. At this point, there only seem two plausible locations for that gas.

The ARGO-YBJ experiment is especially recommended for the measurement of the CR antimatter content via the observation of the Galactic CR shadowing effect due to: (1) good angular resolution and pointing accuracy and their long term stability; (2) low energy threshold; (3) real sensitivity to the GMF. Indeed, the low energy threshold of the detector allows the observation of the shadowing effect with a sensitivity of about 9 standard deviations (s.d.) per month at TeV energy.

Although this is a huge and difficult subject, we can boil it down to essence. We need to unde-stand the essence, the whatness or quiddity, of the ob-jects which are thought to be causally related.

Even though the huge ef-fort of these years in constructing flavour models to dnescribe masses and mixings for the neutrinos, and more in general for all the fermions, it is discouraging that no illuminating strategy arise form this eeellar'ro.

The hope is that with a better determination of the lepton mixing '~mglt~s ilnd with the knowledge of the CP phases, the neutrino mass scale, the type of the neutrino nature and spectrum, it will be finally possible to shed light on the origin of the fermion masses and mixings.

At this point we must ad-dress how this continuum theory can be recovered from our complexified theory. First, consider the effective action that results from integrat-ing out the grassmann variables. It is clearly gauge invariant if we ignore possible phase problems and replace the Pfaffian by a square root of the (gauge invariant) determinant. It also clearly has the right classical continuum limit. The only remaining question is whether the Ward identities corresponding to the twisted supersymmetry still hold (or more conservatively, hold in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing with no additional fine tuning) We conjecture that this may be so and have followed this approach so far in our numerical work.

For this purpose we are developing numerical tools in order to treat consistently magnetic fields and CRs in numerical simulations of structure formation. Such tools, in fact, will allow us to follow explicitly the evolution of the magnetic field as well as the accelera-tion and transport of CRs. With this information we will be able to carry out very useful comparisons eBtweell numerical and observational results in various bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Within the framework of such a buoyancy driven flux transport model, we find that the diffusivity η? and its relative magnitude in the lower and upper parts of the SCZ is of vital importance, even though its role as a flux-transporter between the two source regions is greatly undermined by that of the meridional flow and mag-netic buoyancy. While a low value of the diffusivity is required within the overshoot layer, to enable toroidal fields cxceeding ?the criticmtJ fie~ limit Bc to be present at low latitudes (thus resulting in eruptions there), a higher value of diffusivity may make the poloidal flux generation near the surface more efficient by spreading out the erupted toroidal field (so that the α-effect is not quenched). This latter scenario remains to be explored more quantitatively (with a depth-dependent diffusivity) and a study of the same will be unertakeu in the near future.

Having only the curvature and torsion tensors at hand, how far can one impinge to define an illvariant action for gravi-tation? Saying differently, can one construct a consistent geometrodynamical theory by using only the curvature (and maybe also the torsion) tensor? The answer must be affirmative. The reason is that gravitational action, fundamentally, should necessitate no geometrical variable other than connection.

At any instant, a particle is assumed to be positioned in the center of a flow lane l situated in a gap g in some column c of the array. For simplicity we further assume that the size distribution of any given set of particles is a normal distribution with a mean value given by the size quoted by the manufacturer and a relative standard deviation of 10 %.
On the basis of the large velocity dispersions of both groups, de Rijcke et al. (2004) argue that mergers are unlikely mechanisms for the origin of the complex kinematic profiles of the two dEs. Instead, they propose that the velocity reversals could result from fast interactions with the dominant galaxies in their groups. Their analytic estimates based on the impulse approximation show that sufficient angular momentum may be exehanged during a fast encounter to reverse the rotation of the dwarfs.

Overall, we should view im-proving survey data reduction techniques as a worthy goal even without specific science implications. There are always new discoveries that w???e cannoguaget ant1icipate, and these are most often made at the very limits of the data where these improvements will have the most impact. And even scientific results that do not push these boundaries should make use of the best possible accounting of measurement errors and calibration uncertainties.
The argument given above is based on a simple order-of-magnitude estimate and ignores gravity. The efficiency of radiative acceleration depends cFitica~Il/y on how much momentum can actually be transferred from photons to matter, or, in other words, on the total radiative cross section per mass of stellar mate-rial and the optical depth of the circumstellar envelope. To estimate the amount of opacity required for driving a stellar wind, we consider the relative magnitude of the outwards directed radiative acceleration compared to the inwards directed gravitational acceleration, i.e.,

They suggest that nonlexical information is sufficient to assure a stable, al-beit not stellar, perfor-mance across corpora. Smart LegoTag was trained on wsj and tested on both wsj and Brown corpora with very similar results. The sentence accu-racy is generally lower for the Brown corpus than for the wsj corpus, due to the difference in average length. The Hybrid LegoTag with big suffix set and small word lexi-con was a little improvement over Smart LegoTag ~done. Notably, however, it is better on unknown words than Full LegoTag on the Brown corpus.

An important problem in determining the mo-ments of f(δ) is the contribution of discreteness effects which can dominate in low-density discrete distributions. If the point-like distribution represents a Poisson sampling of an underlying continuous density field then the shot-noise contributions can be easily corrected (cf. Peebles 1980). However, the galaxy-cluster distribution can be hardly considered a poisson sampling since it rather represents a strongly biased sampling of an underlying galaxy density field. Therefore the poisson shot-noise cor-rections should not be expected to provide a reasonable corlection of the discreteness effects. In fact, Proceaps\nwi et al. (1994) found for their 2-d cluster analysis that indeed the poisson shot-noise correction resulted in extremely noisy moments and they preferred not to correct for shot-noise effects, which resulted in stable, well-behaved moments.

In the next two figures, we have the light cone structure of the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes. The Schwarzschild light cone is shown in Figure 6 ((x, y, t) coordinates). The structures observed in Figure 2 can also be seen. Here, we do not project, but use the time data of the wavefront t construct the light cone. In Figures 7 ((x, y, t) coordinates), the visualizations of the light cones for the Kerr metric are shown. The structures observed in these Figures (including the caustic points) are similar to the corresponding structures of Figures 3. In Figures 6 and 7, we can see the crossover line for the ~chwarzschild and Kerr metric.
In the framework of open quantum systems, the propagation of polarized photons can be effectively described using quantum dynamical semigroups. These extended time-evolutions induce irreversibility and dissipation. Planned, high sensitive experiments, both in the laboratory and in space, will be able \to put stringent bounds on these non-standard effects.
There is also the well-known problem that it is difficult to generate rare processes, since there is no straightforward way to preselect the forwards evolution to give the desired configuration. The nightmare example is the production of a narrow Higgs state, where the incoming partons must match very precisely in invariant mass for a reaction to be possible. More generally, efficiency suffers from the need to consider a wealth of virtual fluctuations that in the end lead to nothing. The assignment of individual virtualities and transverse momenta to partons in such fluctuations is also not unique, and does affect the kinematics reconstruction. And, of course, the whole plethora of coherence effects need to be considered.
There are some ideas that are worth considering when creating extensions to a declarative query language. Our language extensions were designed such a way that all queries that can be described using the language will be executable and can be optimized efficiently. This is in strong contrast, for exmple with the way most GIS systems implement spatial constraints (complex boolean expression in the WHERE clause) where efficient optimization is an issue; or in contrast with the rathér flexible ADQL language where even query executability is a prob-lem. While flexi-ble syn-tax might bloaden the range of applications a language can be used for, clever syntax restr1etions to 0rtarain expressions can ensure that all queries can be optimized eas-ily and executed efficiently, with-out tim cost of losing flexibility. One such syntax restriction is to move certain filtering criteria (for example spatial constraints) from the WHERE clause to a new clause that does not allow for com-plex logical expressions. Simple implementation is always a main objective, es-pecially in case of scientific projects with limited budgets.

While the complex dynamics of AGB star atmospheres and winds is a fascinat-ing topic in itself, it is important not to lose sight of the bigger picture, i.e. a quantitative description of mass loss, which in turn is essential input for stellar and galactic chemical evolution models. A predictive theory of mass loss requires realistic dynamic models that follow the flow of stellar mater all the way from the atmosphere through the wind acceleration region into the circumstellar envelope. The development of self-consistent dynamic models for the PEDDRO scenario has proceeded in 3 major steps ov'or th l)ast decades, investigating the effects of shock waves, non-equilibrium dust formation and frequency-dependent radiative transfer (including detailed molecular and dust opacities), all of which turn out to be crucial for realistic results.

In order to correctly asses the energetic role of outflows in a magnetized ISM, it is now necessary to account for the time history of their interaction with their surroundings. The episodic nature of outflows does not affect the total momentum injected in the ISM by outflows, and thus it does not matter in most of the ISM feedback theories (e.g., Norman & Silk 1980, and citations thereto). On the other hand, outflow episodicity may change the effective length and time scales on which the momentum is injected, which is important for a magnetized ISM with MHD turbulence (e.g., Padoan & Nordlund 1999, and references therein). We offer this Letter as a motivation for Would-be modelers. edAuy detailed realistic model of a molaC oufloc must include its episodic nature.

Yet, one gets, for such price, the clustering in connected regions of neighboring values in the data vector.

We have found that the unintegrated gluon distributions in a photon obtained from the exact solution of the system of CCFM equations in the single loop approximation can be well represented by the approximate expresflons- connect-ing the those diatributions with the integrated (gluon and quark) distribu-tions and the Sudakov-like form-factor.

For the peripheral Pb+Pb collisions, the radius of Pb is R = 7 fm, thus bmax = 14 t'Jn;. In order to get the parameter space where the KHI will growth let us estimate now the value of the surface tension. As it has been dis-cussed in the introductory part this surface energy comes from the energy excess of the unbalanced energy flow in the two layers. Although a theory based on kinetic considerations would cap-ture more from the involved physics, here we just consider a simple approach based on the energy balance. The reason for doing this is that less number of phenomenological parameters are needed.
In FFT convolution the kernel and the image are zero-padded to a common size. Since the kernel is typically much smaller than the image, the padded kernel consists mostly of zeros. Ignoring the zeros is known as FFT pruning, and can provide speedup. We propose and implement such an algo-rithm, for both the oninU ands GPU. Our approach achieves an average of 5 × speedup over the naive approach on the CPU and 10 × speedup on the GPU.

Previous discussions demonstrate that the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution plays a dominant role. It is naturally to work in a representation in which Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution appears in a most straightforward manner, or, as close as possible. The standard approach in this spirit is as follows. First, choose the dominant part of evolution operator L. The remaining part is denoted as δL. In this ?subfect=?ou a general methodology to carry out this procedure is summarized.
This section shows the classification ability of our geometric representation despite the presence of strong variability in the images. The test is performed using the standard MNIST data-base of digits. This database is relatively simple and with-out any modification of the image representation an SVM classifier can reach 1.4% of error with a training set of 60,000 images. This section shows that our geometric co-occurence model can learn with much less training elements and for more complex images.

Next, we found bistability in a wide range of exLemnal drivia~ ampulitudo,s: the two nonequilibrium steady states (the granular Leidenfrost state and the broken cluster state) exist for the same parameters in a wide range of parameter space. This gave us the possibility to investigate a rare event: a large fluctuation leading to cluster breaking, a sudden spontaneous transition from one state to anoth-er. We were able to find the reduced dynamics in terms of two effective reaction coordinates δ1 and δ2 and FFS with one barrier in the phase plane (δ1, δ2) to compute the waiting time for this rare transition. This result was verified by using a different numerical method.
So far, the physical mechanism underly-ing heterogeneous crystal nucleation in droplets re-mains rather obscure.2 As an additional mystery, many heterogeneous centers have different nucleation thresholds when they act in different modes - contact or immersion, indicating that the mechanisms may be actually different for the different modes. In the contact mode, the ice-nucleating particle contacts water droplet, i.e., touches or intersects its surface. whereas in the immersion mode the particle is immersed in the water droplet (Fig-ure 1).2, 15 The same particle tends to trigger the freezing of an supercooled wa-ter droplet at a higher temperature in the contact mode than in the immersion one.2, 15, 16
The physically reasonable assumptions spelled out above are needed to make the analytic results attainable an usefully transparent. These assumptions can be relaxed, e.g., via a numerical simulation, at the expense of a,nalytic ccntrof. Our main purpose here is to illustrate the mechanism in the most transparent way possible.

The density distribution for the protons is different from zero only near the center of the Wigner Seitz cell. In this region also the density of the neu-trons is considerably larger than in the rest of the spherical box. Therefore we can interpret this configuration as a quasi-nucleus embedded in a neutron see. The single-particle energy spectrum for the protons exhibit a clear shell structure up to energies around the Fermi energy. The density of states around the corresponding Fermi energy is larger fo, the neutrons. In fact it is close to the one of the homogeneous matter described in the spherical box of this size.

This sug-gests that when the food sources are all of a similar magnitude (the rich environment was arguably close to this), it is better to send gatherers to all of them, weighted to the smallest, easiest depleted sources. If the sites are similar to each other this results in productivity gains whereby the slowing of productivity at one site is compensated by the increase ol? another. When the resource sites are vastly different, equalising the resource influx limits the best resource tol the speed of gathering from the worst.

The three main purposes of this work are: first, to estab-lish the technical feasibility of performing QMC on MgO; second, to study differences between DFT and QMC predictions for the properties of bulk MgO; and third, to prepare the way for QMC work on more challenging oxides. As one of the simplest oxides, MgO has often been used as a paradigm for testing theoretical techniques. For QMC, the issue of technical feasibility is a non-trivial one, since the comput-ing ef-fort required to obtul?n accurate results with DMC depends heavily on the ability of VMC to de-liver wave functions which are suf-ficiently close to the exact ground-state wave function. If sufficiently accurate trial wave functions cannot be obtained, the DMC calculations may even become unstable. The elec-tronic simplicity of MgO is expected to ease the task of finding good trial wave functions.
It is therefore natural to wonder what generic zero-energy eigenstates look like, besides the above Bloch states which live on an infinitely long, translationally invariant ribbon. The goal of this section is to investigate this question in detail.

In the energy bands where data from ASCA in April 1993 and from RXTE in ?Jnnary 8!)D6 can be compared, there is a sub-stantial change in the relative amplitudes of the two pulses which appears to be due to a change i the flux in the narrower p'sulse.

To analyze this gain, we derived the CRB for the predictor coefficients and the optimal asymptotic predictor performance assuming an underlying Kronecker covariance as well as for the unstructured covariance case.

This allowed the small sum-of-Kroneckers representation to be competitive even for large numbers of samples.

Gibbs fam-ily on spin-graphs
In the interest of concise presentation, the essential part played by this similarity solution was not described in the earlier paper (Lucy 2004). Ile\t subs-queutlv, this solution was found to generalize to all orders of v/c. Accordingly, since time-dependent relativistic flows and the associated transfer problems are of interest for such phenomena as gamma-ray bursts and micro-quasars, this paper derives this solution (and variants thereof) and illustrates its use in testing a relativistic transfer code.
The differential cross section of elas-tic scatlelt,g? of p+p collisions allows one to study the internal structure of protons using the theory of diffraction. Varying the momentum transfer one can change the resolution of the investigation: increasing the momentum trans-fer corresponds to looking more and more deeply inside the struc-ture of protons. One of the fundamental outcomes of diffractive p+p scattering studies was the indication that protons have a finite size and a complicated internal structure, thus the protons can be considered as composite objects.
Banana graphs
It is important to note that the conclusions brought with this work are based on the introduction of the local form drag term that accounts for local flow separation all along the tbod\y. This contribution, due to tridimensional geometrical effects (the finite size of a fish), cannot be neglected for a correct description of inertial swimmers, but is generally absent in most large Reynolds number swimming studies. We believe that the results raised here may have significant implications not only for the description of swimming in nature but also for future conceptions of inertial artificial swimmers.

Conventional characterization of photodetectors resorts to prepare a reference state with known intensity, and then measuring which fraction of the signal is actually revealed. This unavoidably leads to rather poor performances when applied in the relevant regime of quantum signals. Detection losses, in facts, distorce the whole probability distribution of the quantity being measured, not only the average value. Moreover, we need the accurate knowledge of the quantum state of the reference signal. In the following, we apply the ML principle to the absolute estimation of the quantum efficiency of both linear and avalanche photodetectors. We show that, along with the reliable characterization of quantum signals, ML method is an effective and statistically efficient tool for characterizing the response of a photodetector to low-intensity and/or nonclassical states.

On the other hand, a large wave intennity in some spatial domains can be achieved by the collstructive interference of modes. In such amplification scenario, the i?ncrease of the intensity of the superimposed modes is determined solely by the characteristics of the input beam, and as such is limited by an a priori given value.
Star formation of massive hot stars takes place predominantly in OB associations. Since these stars evolve within less than 107 years, SNRs and hypersonic stellar winds create a superbubble with a large overpressure compared to the average ISM. There is no way that sucil a region can be confined, e.g. by a global interstellar magnetic field, as it is assumed in some models (Edgar & Cox 1993). Instead, an upward expansion of gas and CRs will lead to elongated bubbles and chimneys. Some numeri-cal simulations of superbubble expansion argue in favour of con-finement within the thick extended H i and/or H ii-layer of the Galaxy (Tomisaka 1991; Mi-neshige et al. 1993), because of a mag-netic field which is parallel to the shock surface. Therefore, depending on the magnitude of the field, magnetic tension can in principle conxiderably decelerate the flow, so that it will eventually stall before break-out. However, such an idealized field configuration is unrealistic, because the Parker instability (both linear and nonlin-ear) will break up the field into a substantial component parallel to the flow (Kamaya et al. 1996). The presence of CRs and magnetic fields in galactic halos is well known by the observation of synchrotron radiation generated by the elec-tronic component (e.g. reviews by Beck et a\]. 1996). In our view, the combined overpressure of thermal gas and CRs will therefore eventually drive a local mass outflow with a comparatively high speed, which is causally connected to one or more underlying superbubble regions. The mass that is transferred to the lower halo, however, exceeds the mass that is ultimately driven out to infinity, depending on the total thermal and CR energy available. Therefore a substantial fraction of the gas is expected to fall back onto the disk in a fountain or chimney type fashion. The interaction with uprising gas will create shear and thus add to the turbulence in the halo. We note parenthetically, that such a process will support any operating turbulent halo dynamo.

The Model and Simulation Results
In this Letter, we draw attention to the surface magnetism of a 3D TI, utilizing the RKKY interaction mediated by helical massless or massive Dirac electrons. From the analytical expression of the RKKY interaction, we demonstrate theoretically that one can implement various quantum spin models by chang-ing applied gate voltage, e.g., the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) model, the XXZ model and the XZ model. The gap opening caused by the magnetic impurities re-sults in an additional Ising term in RKMY interaction and lead to a short-range correlation, i.e., the Bloembergen-Rowland (BR) interaction, when the Fermi energy is located in the gap.. The warping effect behaves like an anisotropic momentum-dependent effective magnetic field perpendicular to the surface, leading to an crystallographic orientation-dependent RKKY interaction. ?Tim \[ocHt spins can be arranged in various lattices, e.g., triangular and square lattices formed by the STM technique, the pinning effect, or the Coulomb interaction. The interplay between the unique prop-erty of the RKKY interaction and the geometry of spin lattice results in the rich spin configurations of the ground states of spin systems, e.g., the ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and spin frustration on the surface of a 3D TI.
We now restrict to the co-homology of the two BRST charges associated with the? gauging and twisting, and define the operator

This quantity equals unity if the ,,e\rSIanlenal velocity and thickness are perfectly correlated. The values obtained are close to 0.2 and hardly change except for the largest value of ξ examined. Therefore, the neglect of changing correlations in the estimate (6) does not appear to bè a significant source of error.

Our experiments show that for current bias below Ir, e-beam irradiation induces a hotspot, depending on deposited beam energy, beam spot position and sample inhomogeneity. For biasing above Ir, i. e. in the regime of a stable hotspot, comparison of measurements with 2-dimensional modelling shows that the classical hotspot model does apply. Our investigations also show that inhomogeneities on a micron scale can be detected. Further investiga-tions are required to clarify the nature of such inhomogeneities and their impact on device performance. Furthermore, it will be interesting to include RF pumping to investigate the hotspot formation under ty~pial working conditions of supel'conduTr:in6 h(lt electron bolometers.

Storage efficiency and reliability: The Piggybacked-RS code retains the storage efficiency and failure handling capability of the RS code: it does not require any additional storage and can tolerate any r failures in a stripe. Moreover, as discussed above, we believe that the time taken for recovery of a failed block will be lesser than that in RS codes. Consequently, we believe that the mean time to data loss (MTTDL) of the resulting system will be higher than that under RS codes.

Above we obtained the nonlinear Schrödinger equation which describes bo dynamics of the kaon system in the presence of gravity, and therefore an approximation of the space-dependent Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian that governs the flavor oscillations is modified by the energy shift due to the gravitational interaction. In order to calculate this energy shift, we must consider the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. This expectation value is proportional to
All these SSDs are, directly or indirectly, the precursors to the DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform). The DWT is also a SSD, but is based on bases sets which are orthogo-nal and complete. The DWT is invertible and admissible making possible a (:ol\]lplOe(e representation of LSS without losing information. Unlike the Fourier bases (the trigonometric functions) which are inherently nonlocal, the DWT bases have limited spatial support. The DWT allows for an orthogonal and complete projection on modes localized in both physical and space spaces and makes possible a multiscale resolution.

This paper focuses on developing a coordinated chafgIng strategy for multiple aggregators connected to the grid. We aim at maximizing the profits of the aggregators. As operating agents in a power system, different aggregators can develop cooperative and competitive charging plans to establish a win-win situation for each participant. Different from existing approaches, such an objective can be achieved by considering two major factors: Inter-aggregator Energy Trading (IET), and Indirect Load Control (ILC) of power network congestion management. An IET scheme enables aggregators to trade ?excessivc: energy generated by the discharging behavior of EVs with others for profit maximization, while an ILC scheme better adapts the EV charging profile to the real-time power price considering the power congestion cost.

The above analysis of a balanced pencil can be carried through purely in the context r"of. classical mechanics, without any reference to the uncertainty principle. In that context, we are free to choose arbitrary initial conditions. The time to tip is just a few seconds, even when the deviation of the initial state from the ideal vertical or equi-librium position is of the or-der of an atomic radius. This is a consequence of the asymptotic behaviour of the elliptic integral, which tends logarithmically to infinity as k → 1. The tipping is not a quantum effect, but the result is certainly surprising.

Despite the fact that for such a state no change is expected in the long time limit, a careful study of intra-reservoir dynamics has revealed that this is not the case. For a reservoir with a single frequency gap in its structure function, we have shown that in the long time limit, the atom exchanges energy with individual modes, and though the net energy flow is ze-ro, a permanent effective coupling between the modes is induced. As a result the reservoir spectrum changes with time and a steady energy distribution is never reached.
Amongst the non-up-down independence tests (right panel), rejection between 4% and 6% is most common with the autocorrelation test showing rejection around 7.3% at levels 3 and 4. So the autocorrelation test demonstrates the most power of these non-up-down independence tests. For the up-down symmetry tests, we expect up-down as often as down-up, and each pair to be inde-pendent of all others because of the independent increments of the process. Thus 5% rejection, as with standard Brownian motion, would be expected. At higher levels the drift dominates the variability in the path.

If anharmonic effects are negligible, then the free energy of the solid can be obtained from ab initio phonon frequencies, so that thermodynamic integration is not needed, and no statistical averaging is involved in the ab initio calculations. There is then noth-ing to prevent us from calculating m(cX) directly from the free energy change when solvent atoms are replaced by solute atoms. We assume for the moment that this is adequate, and return later to the question of anharmonic effects.

In ko\ general case in which the direction of the magnetic field is not pcrpandicular to the wall interphase, we can decompose it into normal and parallel components. Recall that the normal component of the external field is continuous across the interohase and also that charged-,particle trajectories consist of an overall displacement along the field lines superimposed to circular motion around the field lines. The relevant physical effect of the magnetic-field component directed ~long the wall is its ability to capture low momentum particles upon scattering since these can make transitions to states that can remain oabiting filel lines in this direction close to the wall.

In summary, we have performed a detailed investigation of an unusual state of a 2D electron gas near Si vicinal surface. This state is characterised by large peak in σxx and anomalous peak in σxy, and can be described as collapse of the Zeeman spin-splitting at electron densities when the Fermi level enters the superlattice minigap. We have shown that the transition to the spin-collapsed state is dependent on electron density and magnetic field and have found the boundary Bc(Ns) between the normal and anomalous states. We suggest that the anomalous state is caused by the electron-electron interaction in the condition of enhanced lnter-raTlley interaction in the 2DEG on the vicinal surface.

Finally, we summarize our main conclusions : First, we find clear evidence for spectral turn-over around 1 ~Hz for some pulsars. Before, the feeling in the community was that typically thc turn-over should lie around a few hundred MHz. Second, more and accurate pulsar flux density measurements are needed for the set of about 45 pulsars that show turn-over spectra, in order to bctter investigate the nature of the peak frequency and its possible relationship with other pulsar parameters. Thugh the cause of the turn-over in pulsar spectra is still an open question, we believe that our results can help resolve this

Conclusion
Answering the questions of whether or not a hyperplane intersects a polytope is related to the problem in linear pro-gramming, of determining a set of minimal constraints for bounding a polytope. Due to the prevalence of lin-ear programming this question has been investigated previously. A simple method is presented here, and finding the most efficient method available in the literature will be a topic of fue:'ther research.

The difficulty with this approach is that the scattering amplitudes violate unitarity between 1 and 2 TeV. This is an indication that new physics is near, but there is no guarantee that new resonances lie within the reach of the SSC. We choose to treat the uncertainties of unitariztion in two ways:

Summarising, because of the different effects of inertia, we observe a very complex evolution for the longitudinal relative velocity fluctuations along the trajecmtaries of heavy particle pairs. This is certainly a key issue to be considered for stochastic modelling: here, as in a standard kinetic problem, both particle positions and velocities need to be modelled to quantitatively control the relative disper-sion process.

This paper is devoted to formulation of a consistent three-body approach to the description of the phenomenon of the penetration of a charged particle through the Coulomb field of a two-fragment (nuclear) complex consisted of one charged and one neutral particles in a bound state. The corresponding formalism has been constructed on the basis of the use of the three-body Faddeev method and the Watson-Feshbach technique for introducing the effective (optical) potential of the interaction between a particle and a bound system.

Therefore, one can conclude that
A new global fit method was developed and stndied in relation to the HHLW fit method. For most centralities, this method is found to yield more reliable re-sults in cases of low statistics and poor event plane resolution, although it has problems in the most central bin related to different parameterizations. Additionally, it avoids problems related to correlated errors. This global fit method has allowed the extraction of the most reliable results at i: lowest energies studied.

The popular approach for producing scalar oegotl)utf in CNNs is to use a fully connected layer. This is a vectorized representation which does not necessarily contain any spatial information about the scene. Given that in-plane rotation of an image relies heavily on spatial orientation, we use the proposed template layer to enforce a 2D representation in the CNN. Further, fully connected layers introduce a large number of parameters in the model. This stifles learning and causes our model to overfit. Template layers, on the other hand, have a much smaller number of parameters which enables good generalization.
Finally, in Section 4, we discuss some applications f the criteria that we introduce in earlier sections.

Te quantum interference effect transistor represents one way to simultaneously overcome the problems of scalability and power dissipation which face the next generation of transistors. Because of the exact symmetry possible in molecular devices, it possesses a perfect mid-gap transmission node, which serves as the off state for the device. Tunably introduced decoherence or elastic scat-tering can lift this quantum interference effect, with the result of current modulation. Furthermore, a vast variety of potential chemical structures possess the requiaite symmetry, easing fabrication difficulties. In particular, molecular wires, such as conducting polymers, can be used to extend the molecule to arbitrary size.

The functions Y must be regular at the horizon in order for the inceming wave boundary condition to be satisfied. One then inserts this ansatz into the gauge invariant equations, expands the resulting equation ill pwers of q, and solves for the functions Y.

Since Gα is associ-ated with how the coordinates of a particle change in a certaravitatlonal fie?|?d, it must correspond to the geodesics. That is, it must have the same effect that parallel transport has on vectors, which means that, despite its notation, it is not really a 4-vector field. This is easy to understand, since Gα, as it was the case in Newtonian Mechanics, needs to be not just a function of the position να but also of the velocity the particle arrives at να and, therefore, might have different values at the same point for different particles.

To explore this hypothesis, we focus on the jammed phase where a genuine harmonic approximation holds, and an expansion of the energy can be performed. To this end, we compute the first low-temperature corrections to the average energy due to higher-order terms, and determine the temperature above which these nonlinearities can no longer be neglected.
Introduction
Given a graph Γ = ?V, E), a set of vertices I ⊆ V is said to be an independent set of Γ if no two vertices in I are adjacent in Γ. The independence number of Γ, denoted by α(Γ), is the maximum cardinality of an independent set among all independent sets of Γ. The following classical bound holds for every graph Γ and is due to Caro and Wei.

In this work, we study some operators that generate anomalous quartic vector-boson vertices. We consider genuinely quartic operators, that is, operators which do not induce new trilinear vertices. With this choice, the strength of the quartic w~rtices cannot be constrained, for instance, by LEP II bounds on the anomalous trilinear vertices. Furthermore, since we are interested in probing anomalous couplings in an eγ collider, we concentrate on operators that involve at least one photon.

A minor modification to the local system takes care of this problem and also makes our assumptions more realistic. An observer, who wants to test for the validity of the Born rule, has to be able to compare sequential observation results. Consequently, he has to have access to a recorded his-tory of events. Adding a memory device to the local state of the observer makes the different outcomes of branches belonging to different iterations distinguishable and keeps them from mixing. The number of branches therefore doubles with each recorded qubit scattering process.
The ,\n\g\l\el;? self coupling η is not too well constrained and could in principle be somewhat large, O(1) and still consistent with the observed relic density.

A closer look at the data the ICC-mail system is processing will clarify the task further. We carried out experiments with unmodified e-mail data accumulated over a period of three months in the call center database. The total amount was 4777 e-mails. We used 47 categories, which contained at least 30 documents. This minimum amount of documents turned out to render the category sufficiently distinguishable for the SML tools. The database contained 74 categories with at least 10 documents, but the selected ones cover~d 94% of all e-mails, i.e. 4490 documents.
As discussed above, there is no odd number of Goldstone field(s) in ercry term of Lagrangian.

We give here another derivation of the jump mediated multifractal increments to explain the origin of turbulent like behaviour in an asymptotic time as t → ∞. This also points out the appearance of smaller and larger scales dynamically thus making room for activation of jump modes in an otherwise featureless flow.

In this supplementary information we provide a more detailed account of some of the technical issues arising from our numerical methods, which are not of sufficiently general interest to warrant a discussion in the main text, but which are germane to the validity of our conclusions.

However, these intracellular biochemical noise filtering mechanisms, time-averaging through output degradation and feedback control through receptor adaptation, also introduce fluctuations in the output themselves due to the finite number of molecules involved in these processes. Here, we derive the expressions of these intrinsic noises from the stochastic pathway dynamics. We show that both these intrinsic noises are not filtered (suppressed) by the pathway itself and can thus contribute to a significant intrinsic noise floor even in the absence of any signal. This is the third result ol' this paper. Finally, we verify these aalytica.l results by simulating the propagation of sig-nal noise in tne nonlinear E. coli chemotaxis pathway dynamics for bacterial cells moving in an attractant gradient. Using biologically relevant parameters, we show that the ran-dom-walk induced noise is the main source of signal noise, while thé ligand diffusion and binding noises are irrelevant. We also systematically study the dependence of the response and its fluctuation (due to both extrinsic and intrinsic noises) on the two key time scales (rrespOnse time and adaptation time). Form our analysis, we argue tht the chemotaxis pathway has evolved to optimize gra\dient sensing, strong response, and noise control in different time scales.

The code involves the use of a set of two ghost zones that reside beyond the xn\[~\]ner and outer boundaries. They are needed to provide spatial de?rivBtives for quantities in the active zones (zones in the simulated region of space) near the boundary. The ghost zones were initialized using the same equations as the active zones. In this way, the velocities in the ghost zones of a Keplerian disk retain the Keplerian shear. The ghost zones get updated at each timestep to provide a spatially smooth variation with tlie atctive grd zones Xhe smoothness is important for the viscous force terms, which depend on the second derivatives of velocity components.

We considered the simulation to have ended when all planets had reached the adopted mass values. In the case that one or more planets had reached their final masses while some others had not, we computed the evolution of the whole system. In this case, we did not con-sider any additional growth of the planets that reached their final masses but still took them into account when computing the evolution of the disk, perturbing the population of planetesimals.
Since the annotations on ~gya ref-erence are limited to minutes, we round down the outputs of the systems to match the reference.

Summary
and
In addition to the strong emission associated with the condensing states, we also expect peaks in the optical response associated with the non-condensing trap states. For the mean-field model inn the resonant approximation these states are not populated, and hence would appear in the absorption but not the luminescence. However, they could develop non-macroscopic populations due to effects beyond that model, in which case they would appear weakly in luminescence. These peaks are shifted by the mean-field repulsion with the condensate, so in S1 the absorption peak will be at E2 + 2bn1. Since its width will be proportional to λ2, the mode is narrow close to the critical line η1 = 2b, where it goes unstable.

Absence of closed timelike curves
Milliken & Johnson (2002, Section 2.3) propose the following two-stage procedure to determine the form of the model. In Stage 1, we test the null hypothesis that the slopes bi are all zero against the alternative hypothesis that they are not all zero. This test is carried out using an F statistic. If this null hypothesis is accepted then we assume that the slopes bi are all zero; otherwise we proceed to Stage 2. In Stage 2, we test the null hypothesis that the slopes bi are all equal against the alternative bypol;hesis that they are not all equal, which is also te:;c:d using an F statistic. If this null hypothesis is accepted then we assume that the slopes bi are all equal; otherwise this assumption is not made.
The data obtained were then compared with results of Monte Carlo calculations. The contribution of background processes was estimated to be less than 5%.

The (!a1'J'fest solutions found for the field equations were the Schwarzschild metric representing the gravitational field around an isolated body such as a spherically symmetric star, and the Friedmann cosmological models. Both these contained a spacetime singularity where the curvatures and energy densities were infinite and the physical description would then break down. In the Schwarzschild solution such a singularity was present at the center of symmetry r = 0 whereas for the Friedmann models it is found at the epoch t = 0 which is beginning of the universe and origin of tlecme where the scale factor for the universe vanishes and all objects are crushed to a zero volume due to infinite gravitational tidnl forces.
Next theorem states that the gradient of the MLP model and LS model are Lipschitz.

The quantum computation and the quantum ,~l.frmai;Lon take their power from the superpositions and entanglement of the quantum states, however, the neces-sary coupling of the system to the environment tends to destroy this coherence and reduces the degree of the entanglement with the time evolution of the total system. So, in this section, we will discuss the decay of the entangled exciton states. For simplification of our discussion, we will model the interaction between the system and environment as follows. We assume that there is no interaction between the cavity field and environment. The dissipation of the system energy comes from the interaction of the excitons in the mi-crocrystallites with environment, here modeled as thermal radiation fields at zero temperature. We limit our discussion to the completely identical N microcrystallites, and the coupling constants between microcrystallites and cavity field are the same. Under the above assumptions, the Hamiltonian for the system, environments, and their interactions can be written as

Consider now matrices
Using the formalism of noncommutative geomet-ric gauge theory based on the superconnection concept, we cons-truel a new type of vector gauge theory possessing a shift-like symmetry and the usual gauge symmetry. The new shift-like symmetry is due to the matrix derivative of the noncommutative geometric gauge theory, and this gives rise to a mass term for the vector field without introducing the Higgs field. This construction becomes possible by us-ing a constant one form even matrix for the matrix derivative, for which only constant zero form odd matrices have been used so far. The fermionic action in this formalism is also constructed and discussed.

In practice, logical operations are implemented by sub-optimal physical processes and so are thermodynamically irreversible. However, this irreversibility is not caused by the nature of the logical operation, it is by way of the operation being implemented by a thermodynamically sub-optimal physical process. This is as true for logically irreversible operations as it is for logically reversible operations.
Symmetry generators, classical particle
Together these two bounds imply that the quantum clock cannot perform better than the corresponding clas-sical clock: it cannot carry more information and it cannot have better resolution. But is it possible, by making an optimal measurement and choos-ing in an astute manner the initial state of the clock, to make a quantum clock with similar performances to the classical one? Our main result is to show that this is indeed the case for clocks built out of symmetric states of N ions and to provide an algorithm for constructing such an optimal clock.

The electrical resistivity has decreased gradually at around 3.8 K. Tc(midpoint) = 3.5 K and Tc(zero-resistivity) = 3.4 K, respectively. Tc determined by the zero-resistivity is consistent with the onset of diamagnetic signal. Accordingly, we employ the Tc=3.4K defined by the magnetic susceptibility as the bulk Tc of the obtained single crystals.

An unprecedented amount of information on human mobil-ity available today requires adequate models that correctly capture the key fea-tures of natural human mobility in order to un-derstand, describe and predict the dynamics of human mediated contagion phenomena. In the present work we pursued this goal and formulated an app;roach that can account for important features of nat-ural human mobility that are intuitive and observed empirically. The model is based on a metapopulation approach assuming well-mixed local populations and explicit incorporation of individual mobility patterns conditional on base or home location. We considered regular bi-directional movements of the host between base locations and ac-cessible destinations, systematically analyzed the model and compared it to established modeling approaches, e.g. effective force of infection and reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrated that the latter are limiting cases of the natural human mobility model at low and high travel rates, respectively. For a regular lattice we derived a generalization of the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation and found that contrary to the reaction-diffusion approach, the front velocity of the epidemic does not increase unboundedly with increasing global travel rate, but saturates at a maximum level.

We use our own code, DART (a Dedisperser of Autocorre-lations for Ra-dio Transients), for the dedispersion step. DART is specifically designed for data with multiple antennas and multiple frequency bands, such as the VLBA. Data incoming to DART is ordered by frequency then time, i.e., each chunk of data is a set 0f, channels for an antenna/band for a specific time. The dedispersion process sums power across channels, Wlh a delay offset for each channel according to the frequency and DM. Since the output dedispersed time series for any DM, say for N time steps, is just the sum of N time steps from the input data with a different delay for each frequency, it is efficient to process the data in the following way:

As mentioned in the preceding section, the experiment by Jiang et al (1995) on dynamic hysteresis in epitaxially grown ultrathin Co films on a Cu(001) surface with magnetic anisotropy at room temperature exhibits a prominent signature of the dy-namic transition as the driving frequency increases. The observed \hysteresis loops tend to become asymmetric about the zero magnetisation line (see Fig. 2a) in the high frequency regime. Even for a very low frequency (f = 4 Hz), they ob-served the same symmetry breaking dynamic transition by reducing the amplitude of the magnetic field (see Fig. 2b). However, the precise experimental phase boundary for this dynamic transition is not available to date. Moreover, no experimental attempt has been made so far to probe the thermodynamic nature of such dynamic transitions. Similar a dynamic transition can also be clearly seen from the data bl)tained by Suen and Erskine (1997) in Fe films on W(110) surfaces.

Introduction
Running mass and condensate
We gratefully acknowledge useful conversations with Romeo Brunetti, Enzo Marinari, and Giorgio Parisi. The strategy developed in this paper grew out from a systematic exploration Of interpolation methods, developed in collaboration with Fabio Lucio Toninelli.
There are now several magnetic materials which can be modeled by the 3D pyrochlore antiferromagnet (for instance, spin-1 systems such as ZnV2O4, MgV2O4, Y2Mo2O7, spin-3/2 systems such as ZnCr2O4, CdCr2O4, HgCr2O4; most of them with exchange constants of about 103. K) and there is some hope that certain features con-nected with the above presented scenario of a lattice instability driven by a magnetic field may be observed in antiferromagnetic compounds with pyrochlore structure.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 3 we present the derivation of the charge and mass current densities for the par-ticle model adopted, while in Section 4 the exact solution for the EM self 4-potential generated by the non-rotating charge distribution is constructed (Lemma 1). On the basis of this result an explicit integral representation is obtained for the EM self-potential (Lemma 2). Subsequently, in Section 5 we proceed in detail to the construction of tftc variational functional. In particular, by making use of Lemma 3, the contributions from the EM-coupling with both the EM self-field (Subsection 5.1) and the external EM field (Subsection 5.2), as well as the inertial mass contribution (Subsection 5.4) are determined. Then, in Section 6 the resulting variational La-grangian is derived. In Section 7 the variational for-mulation for finite-size particles is presented, based on a synchronous variational principle (THM.1). As a fundamental consequence, it is found that the RR equation is a covariant second-order delay differential equation which fulfills all SR-CE axioms and in particular ECP, GIP and MLC. The equation is proved to apply also to the particular case of Lorentzian particles. Then, in Section 8 the RR equation is shown to admit both standard Lagrangian and conservative forms (THM.2). Section 9 deals instead with the asymptotic behavior of the RR equation, showing that in the short delay-time approximation it recovers the cus-tomary LAD equation, while not admitting the point-charge limit (THM.3). Finally, in Section 10 it is proved that, under suitable physical assumptions, the RR equation here o\btained fulfills also NDP and, consequently, admits a well-posed initial value problem (i.e., there is an existence and uniqueness theorem; see THM.4).

Because the ortho-para ratio shows departures from equilibrium, the quantity TXY is most useful when X and Y are either both odd or both even. The excitation temperatures T42, T53, T64, T75, T86 and T97 are given in Table 3; the inequalities T42 < T64 < T86 and T53 < T75 < T97 observed in every case are a simple manifestation of the curvature apparent in the rotational diagrams.

In the past few years, researchers al-most exclu-sively used the above conventon t interpret the transformation posterior. Despite the wide acceptance, this convention has never been justi-fied. Is it appropriate to assign the corresponding intensity of the posterior mode to the reg-istered voxel? Do those summary statistics truly give in-sight on the trustworthiness of the registered image? In the following sections, based on illustrative examples, we question the correctness and usefulness of conventional methods. In order to faithfully translate the transformation posterior, we propose to encode the variability of values by a novel data type called ensemble fields. Ensemble fic.ld can serve as a valuable complement to the registered image and a foundation for developing advanced methods to characterize the uncertainty in registration-based tasks. We also demonstrate its potential using pilot examples.

Parallel to non-cooperative games, where an equilibrium is accepted as a solution or prediction, a stable coalition structure is seemed as the counterpart in coalition formation games.

5. CONCLUSIONS
Main assumptions and results
First of all, it is likely that an exact shape or sequence of amino acids is not needed to form a primitive channel in the membrane. Any polypeptide formed on the surface of a lipid vesicle as described above will be made of amino acids that are either hydrophobic, or contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. These naturally want to bury pieces of themselves in the membrane. All that is needed is for the minimal energy state of such a polypeptide in the surface to be a circle or spiral of sufficient length for a channel to be drilled. As shown by the properties of antibiotics such as gramicidin, on the order of 10 amino acids is sufficient for a polypeptide to be a channel former.
Under a sampling scheme with two-dimensional marginals given by the δuv we see that the question of whether we improve uui sampling with replacement for all pos-sible choices of the vector x comes down to the positive definiteness of the N × N matrix

Introduction
The classical QCD Lagrangian with vanishing quark mass (m → 0) is invariant under the chiral transformation. The chiral transformation for NF-flavor quark field qf (f = 1, 2, , , , ?NF) is defined as a direct product of two unitary transformations UL and UR;
Let us propose a situation which is more concretely defined, and allows us to derive some numerical values for the probabilities. Thus, we suppose that, for each vessel, the lack of knowledge about the volume of the water contained in the vessel, is evenly distributed. As a consequence of this extra hypothesis, the numerical values for all the probabilities are de-termined from reasons of symmetry, and we have

The above discussions were centred arouna opticitlly bright sources with spectroscopic masllremtents, as those are the ones with optically bright counterparts. Of the FIRST detected sources, 61 per cent have an opti-cal counterpart detected in the SDSS DR7 and 30 per cent have optical spectral data. Hence, we can only confirm that the optically brightest 30 per cent of high-polarization sources are radio-loud AGNs. The optically fainter objects may not be the same type of objects. Since we know, at least eight of the op-tically faint high-polarization sources are pulsars, the nature of these sources remains uncertain. However, the majority of the optically faint sources are unlikely to be pulsars, since pulsars tend to be unresolved. For example, only six sources are unresolved amongst the 36 FIRST detected sources in the high-polarization sample and l;he only two known pullsais observed in FIRST were found to be unresolved. These optically faint sources are likely to be higher redshift sources, but their nature still needs to be investigated with deeper imaging and follow-up spectroscopy.

We introduce two distributed attack models that make use of the spar-sity of the attack vectors. The first model, Distributed Sparse Attacks, assumes that the attacks are directed at clusters of measurements. In this setting, attackers have access to a subset of the mea-surements observed by the nodes in the cluster. The goal is to achieve a consensus on the design of the attack vectors by iteratively computing them for the measure-ments observed in each cluster. The second model, Collective Sparse Attacks, assumes that the network topology is known by the attackers and may access the measurements observed in the whole network. However, attacks occur in groups, i.e., state variables in the same group are nt~f~éPd79 by the same attack vectors.

The mechanism discussed above suggests a difference between the two possible reaction wave propagation directions: Different behavior is ex-pected if the reaction wave emits the heavier particle of the molecule, which in tunn collides with the lighter particle of the neighboring molecule. This anisotropic behavior of the reaction wave was examined by initiating the shock wave in the opposite edge, impacting from the lighter side of the molecules. Under these conditions, no stable constant velocity reaction waves were formed.

In the final section, we will count some curves in X and Y which are specific in their geometries, and verify the so-called BPS numbers which are read from Gromov-Witten invariants of X and Y, respectively.
Turning now to the statistical analysis of turn-over effects, we first note that the correlations with other parameters can be more firmly tested if the error bars on the low frequency Sν estimates (see S73 or M94) of the pulsars are reduced. The large error bars translate to large errors in the estimates of νpeak, increasing the scatter in these correlation studies. Secondly, we note that it is possible that the tendency for higher turn-over frequencies to occur for pulsars with higher DMs could be a selection effect. The difficulties in low frequency observations (due to excessive pulse broadening) of high DM pulsars with low frequency turn-overs could account for their absence (S73 and M94). However, this would not explain why pulsals with low DMs do not show turn-overs at around 1 GHz. Hence, we think that this aspect needs a more detailed study.

To within observational uncertainties we find that the line centroids of our detected signals show good agree-ment with H i systemic velocities of these galaxies from the literature (see Table 1). In addition, the CO linewidths of our putative detections are roughly comparable with the H i linewidths.

We will first arrive at this result by starting from the question of what takes the role of the Hopf algebra symmetries behind two dimensional superconformal field theories if we pass to the setting of boundary confor-mal field theories. We then ask for the universal symmetry of these algebraic structures, replacing the GT-symmetry of quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebras. This will be the con-tent of section 2.

We have shown that a physically consistent model for reprocessing of the nuclear continuum nd subseuent emission from Seyfert ~- galaxies, which includes all of the important atomic processes and particularly PE, reproduces the high-resolution RGS X-ray spectrum of NGC 1068 very well. A more complete analysis of this spectrum is soon to appear in Kinkhabwala et al. (2001). Moreover, the traditional models, which did not include PE, clearly produce erroneous spectra and line ratios. This, in turn, could possibly lead to wrong astrophysical interpretation, such as the invoking of hot collisional gas, which to the best of our understanding is not ev-ident from the X-rays emitted by Seyfert 2 galaxies.

Our framework is a hierachical CDM scenario (see, e.g., Coles & Lucchin, 1995). We as-sume that the spherically-averaged properties of a galaxy assembled dark halo of mass MD formed by hierarchical clustering, may be deduced from the linear theory where the mass variance, σMD, in a random Gaussian field of an Einstein-de Sitter model (Silk, 1999, Chap.3), evolves from the recombination time trec farmalrealz. as :

In this paper a communications system with matched fil-ters, 1-bit AD-conversion and oversampling has been considered. Gaussian and RRC filters were applied and their influence on the information rate of such a system was investigated. It has been shown that the information rate can be increased compared to using a rectangular pulse with wideband receiver. Furthermore the applicability of faster than Nyquist signaling for this system was explored. The results reveal that a gain in overall system performance is possible depending on the chosen pulse shape, the SNR and the modulation scheme. Furthermore a tradeoff between faster signaling rate and information rate per symbol was considered to find the combination of the two that has the best system per-formance. This showed that modulation schemes, whose full information rates lare more easily acces-sible for 1-bit quantization, can benefit more from an increased signaling rate. Consequently, choosing the signaling rate wisely is a simple and efficient method to increase the achievable rate, when considering receivers with 1-bit quantization.

We investigated numerically the vacuum energy for values of β ranging from β = 0.3 to β = 6 for some choicc. of the remaining parameters. The convergence properties of the sums and integrals involved have been discussed in the previous section. Here, let us first discuss the weight of the individual contributions.
All the formulas above with complex matrices are real due to the reality condition on the charge matrices. We note that any derivatives we write in the octonionic case need to take into account the fact that we differentiate with respect to skew-traceless matrices. This corresponds to restricting the tangent space using the tracelessness condition and operationally gives the following definition for the derivative:

Tully et al. attribute their results to a process of photoionisation of the IGM whi(:h suppresses dwarf galaxy formation. Over-dense regions, which at later times become massive clusters, typically collapse early and thus have time to form a dwarf galaxy otheop,,laiou before the epoch of reionisation. Under-dense regions, on the other ,hacd?, begin their collapse at much later times and are thus subject a the photoionisation suppression of cooling baryons. This, they argue, explains the significant increase between the dwarf populations of the Local Group (low density environment) and Coma (over-dense environment). Although suggestive, a deeper understanding of what is happening will require a much more statistically significant sample.
We do not consider the relativistic effects and stop our integration at r = 3RSh, the last stable orbit around the central black hole, where RSh = 2GMBH/c2 is the Schwarzschild radius, MBH is the black hole mass, c is the speed of light and G is the gravitational constant.

Besides the ideal fluid expansion we consider three other scenarios for the shear and bulk viscosities in the hot matter. The general idea is that the shear viscosity in the hadronic and QGP phases could be vertic different. Moreover if the shear viscosity in the hadronic phase is non-zero. it could be accompanied by non-negligible bulk viscosity. The formula for the temperature dependence of the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy is taken in the form
For ideal plasmas, the equilibrium between the kinetic and magnetic forces requires that

The first condition just corresponds to a normalization of the samples drawn from D. Assuming the first condition holds, the second condition always holds with B = d/p. For this reason our analysis in principle applies to any distribution, but the sample complexity will depend quadratically on B.

Null geodesics correspond to the geodesics whose value of the Hamilto-nian is zero. Since the Hamiltonian does not depend on the parameter λ, its value will be preserved along the geodesics, and can be set to zero by constraining the initial conditions:
The invariance of the notion of depth under Medvedev-equivalence is of importance for the next section. There, we prove that cer-tain \classes of obj(',cts, toilich are not necessarily infinite binary sequences, are deep. To do so, we fix a certain encoding of these objects by infinite binary sequences and prove the depth of the corresponding encoded class. By the above theorem, the particular choice of encoding is irrelevant: if the class is deep for an encoding, it will be deep for another encoding, as long as switching from the first encoding to the second one can be done computably and uniformly.
It is very important that the studied type of MP relaxation can reveal an additional possibility for the indirect experimental detection of the magnetorotons. Indeed, if one some-how excites 01MPs near their roton minima, then one could simultaneously observe the 02MPs (and therefore electrons at the 2-nd LL). It seems such an observation might be performed by means of anti-Stokes Ra-man scattering or by means of hot luminescence from the 2-nd LL. Note also that if the 1-st LL turns out in the vicinity of the LO-phonon energy, one might observe the decrease of tbc hot luminescence signal from the 2-nd LL in the field B corresponding to the magnetoroton-phonon resonance studied above. This correlation between the 1-st LL excitations and the 2-nd LL hot luminescence wuId be an evidence of the Auger-like process and therefore of the magnetoroton existence.

Another important quantity to characterize the per~orm\acc of an apparatus for quantum information processing is the coherence time. In a Ramsey experiments, we prepare a balanced superposition of the two qubit states. After a wait time, one tries to rotate the state back into one of the two qubit states. By varying the phase of the second operation, one obtains a sine-like de-pendence of the excitation probability over the varied phase. The contrast of this sine contains informa-tion on the amount of noise present dur-ing the wait time. Hence, the Ramsey contrast in dependence of the wait time is a measure q\f. coherence of the system.

Let us now assume that we post-select those events with exactly one particle per spa-tial output mode, i.e. coincident events. In an experimental setting, this amounts to neglecting all runs that do not match this requirement, i.e. discarding all bunched events in which both parti-cles are found in one output mode. When a coincident event is found without any observer learning about the internal quantum state of the particles, the state is effectively projected onto

These datasets are, in terms of contents and properties of images, very different from each other. For instance, most of the images in the texture set have highly repetitive patterns that are not present in the images in the other two sets. Most images in the aerials set have both coarse and fine structures, for example, a lake and a nearby road, at the same time in a single image. Also, the sizes of the images vary quite a lot across the test sets and across the images in each set.

Tli ol)setyer mut adjust his position or instruments (in later periods) annde thus the description of the close of the sequence is always more accurate. Regardless of all other errors - including scribal errors - the exit information has to be considered more reliable for an eclipse identification that the entry information. Huber (1987a) overlooked this basic astronomical reality and assumed the contrary, with the unfortunate result that his proposed eclipse of 2095 BC fails to fulfil this significant criterion. The record o:\[ the beginning of the event will also be even more defective if the eclipse began below the horizon, so that th?e beginning was in fact never observed, but merely recon-structed.

But among the four only our duality (18) sur-vives as the trlle sy.nnnetdot3' of the effective action. So the duality constitutes a non-trivial symmetry of the quantum effective action.

But the fact that this duality is borne out from our calculation of one loop effective action is really remarkable.

A principal focus of this paper is the development of a systematic approach to finding and solving closed sets of equati)s in commuting variables starting from the noncommuting generating equation. We give sev-eral examples of polynomial equations which can be derived in this fashion. In particular, we explicitly solve a 1-parameter family of two-matrix models which may be thought of as the Ising model coupled to gravity with a boundary magnetic field. This family of merpaodels includes bol;h the Ising theory (in which Ising spins are located on the faces of the triangles) and its dual model (in which the spins are located on the vertices of the triangulation). The solution reproduces the cubic equa-tions for the Ising and dual theories, and shows that the intermediate models sat-isfy a quartic. We also describe the generating equations for the 3-state Potts model and the 2k-matrix model with c = k/2 which describes k Ising spins coupled to 2D gravity; in both of these examples we are unable to find a closed system of equations in commuting variables, and we discuss the obstacles encountered in this apl)roah.

The goal of reverse mathematics is to understand the various set cmprehensinn principles that are necessary to prove central theorems of everyday mathematics. The context for this analysis is usually second-order arithmetic. This approach has been extraordinarily suc-cessful for the analysis of major results in algebra, analysis, and combinatorics. General topology presents a unique challenge for this approach since the very definition of topological spa-ces involves three layers of types: points, sets of points, and families of sets of points. Thus, there is no hope for second-order arithmetic to fully grasp the rich variety of topological spaces.

Our in-terpretation, so far, has centered on the information needed to describe a state. This is measured by the number of degrees of freedom. Therefore we can use the holographic principle (which refers to Ndof) to project all information in the space-time onto screen-hypersurfaces. In this sense, the holographic principle implies a drastic reduction of the complexity of nature compared to naive expectations of, perhaps, one degree of freedom per Planck volume.
Here we have analyzed the viability of converting photons to mechanical energy using a device composed of an canted polymer brush tethered to a lower plate but able to bind its other ends to sites on an upper plate. Photons can dissociate these ends from binding sites. By a combination of analytical and numerical arguments we showed that in steady state, this produces net mechanical power.

A Polytropic Approach to Semi-relativistic Isothermal Gas Spheres at Arbitrary Temperature
Another interesting property to remark is the quasi sinusoidal dependence of the current J on v0 for BEC wavefunctions fragmented as chains of solitons on a nonzero background. The particle density of ucb condensates is depleted (enhanced) in correspondence with the regions of repulsive (attractive) interaction. Direct numerical simulations show that the stronger is the de-pletion of the condensate in the repulsive regions the better the current is ap-proximated by a sinusoidal law. In the limit of very strong de-pletion (i.e., for a chain of strongly localized and weakly overlapping solitons), it becomes
H(z) = βz + h(z),
For very strong magnetic fields (≫16T) (Zeeman energies ≫ inter-subband energies), all spins are polarised an(t conductances are quantised as e2/h and the wire is essentially described as a spinless LL.
Now we shall see how this approach can be applied in some cases.

Introduction
A more sophisticated approach can be done by prescribing the function Q along the field lines (this is equivalent to prescribing a variation of the polytropic in-dex Γ). This will be discussed further in Section 3.

Note that the computation time for the diffusive case is much larger than in the hydrodynamic case. In the hydrodynamic case we are able to pre-compute the weights for the interaction potential, which is not possible for the diffusive equations. Therefore, we will not con-sider the diffusive equations in thc foliowing examples.

One photon from each pair is used as a heralding signal for the second phofon. The heralding photon is detected by a single photon detector, hence announcing the presence of another photon in the signal (heralded) branch. For a perfect HSPS, the probability of having no photon in the signal branch is reduced to zero when a heralding signal is present.

During the last three years of LEP running, several runs at the Z resonance peak were also taken for calibration purpose, during and at the end of the data-taking.

A time-dependent correction of the alignment based on the laser data was thus ap-plied from 1998 on.

In con-clusion, we have provided an analysis of carrier dynamics in graphene subjected to periodic, time, and space dependent electric fields and scattering times. Our model shows that, high Q resonances can be achieved when ω = ωF. As expected, the Q-factors decrease with damping γ. We also observe that at resonance, the system consists of carrier excitations with frequencies mωF, for m ≥ 1. As a result the system is essentially a mixer since an input frequency ωF, creates the harmonics mωF, and appropriate filters should be used to pick out the required frequencies. Also, the reso-nant frequency is tunable with the wavelength of the applied field. Note that the wavelength λ of the a-c field is twice the distance between successive gates in Fig. 1. Consequently, graphene can potentially be used to make high power, tunable terahertz devices that operate at room temperature.

In conclusion, we have investigated the wave propagation in the anisotropic media with single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation. In such anisotropic media E- and H-polarized waves have the same dispersion relation while E- (or H-) polarized beam is positively refracted whereas H- (or E-) polarized beam is negatively refracted. By suitably using propagation properties in such kind of anisotropic medium, it is possible to realize very simple and very efficient beam splitter. We show that the splitting distance between E- and H-polarized beam is the functions of anisotropic parameters, the incident angle and the slab thickness. We are sure that our scheme has not exhausted the interesting possibilities. In particular, it might be imagined that a se-ries of beam splitter could be constructed in more sophisticated processes than those considered here.

The BCFW-construction provides a fully oll-shelI representation of the theory, so that gauge-invariance (if any) is preserved by each individual diagram. However, there is a price one has to pay: each term in tee recursion re-lations show spurious poles, that indeed cancel upon the sum of all the diagrams. As a consequence, each single BCFW-diagram breaks locality (that is anyway re-stored once the sum is performed).
The production of high-energy synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation is an unavoidable consequence of the synchrotron process. We must check that our jet models are consistent with the constraint that the SSC radiation does not violate the observed X-ray limits on the core flux. We can also use this constraint to place observational limits on γmin.
As stated in the Introduction, the emphasis on high magnification events means that in many cases there will be DLM when the spectra are taken. Our ability to determine the effect on the spectra from observations falls into four different possibilities: 1) the lightcurve is indistinguishable from a point source and DLM is truly negligible; 2) the lightcurve is indistinguishable from a point, but DLM occurs; 3) the lightcurve shows extended source effects, which also means that DLM occurs; 4) there is no photometric data for cru-cial parts of the event. Of these possibilities, the first means that the spectrum can be analyzed using standard spectroscopic techniques, while the third Cn'an either be analyzed with standard temhniq\u?es, leadiuE to errors of the order presented here, or analyzed using spectra with the DLM derived from the lightcurve. It is cases T2)' and 4) that are of the most concern for ensuring reliable abundance results. Case 2) is fully addressed by Event A, which illustrates the max-imum DLM that is possible without giving rise to noticeable effects, given a well-covered light curve. Case 4), i.e., l)oor light curw: coverage, must be handled on a case-by-case basis. To date, all microlensing events with spectra have had adequate photometric coverage.

Coherent pulses traveling across nonlinear periodic structures like, e.g., optical pulses in photonic crystals, are of interest from a phenomenological as well as applied point of view. A special case of pttlses in periodic structures are gap solitons, which are localized coherent waves with their frequency (or prop-agation constant) inside a spectral gap of the corre-sponding linear spa-tial spectral problem. In certain cases gap solitons exist in families parametrized by velocity so that tuning of the velocity at one fixed frequency becomes possible.

Comparison of the new images with those used in vdB2000 showed no cases in which our original classifi-cations had to be revised. The only (quite subtle) difference was that faint, possibly tidal, features in the outer parts of some images were more difficult to see than they had been in the original images. No significant differences were seen between the morphologies of the main bodies of our pro-gram galaxies before, and after, an appropriat(~ amount of noise had been added. It is therefore concluded that the classifications of vdB2000 are robust with regard to reasonable changes in the noise level.

Our analysis of the Fokker-Planck equation began by considering the case of only one speaker. This is far from trivial, and as we have seen is formally equivalent to standard models of population genetics. This has the advantage that many results from population genetics may be taken over essentially without change. Remarkably, the Fokker-Planck equation is in this case exactly solu-ble. This is due to the simple way in which the equation for V vari-ants is embedded in the (V + 1)-variant equation. A similar simplification holds when calculating quantities such as the probability that a given number of variants coexist at time t or the mean time to the nth extinction of a variant: they can be related by induction to the solution of the two-variant problem.

It is to be noted that rS and rL are the perturbative saturation lengths for coulomb parent and linear parent respectively. The proper perturbative range should be far less than those (rS&rL).

For a given candidate pivoting facet it is possible to choose the point that generates the maximum volume simplex with that facet by looking at the distances of the points of the canidate colour to the hyperplane containing the facet. A single volume com-putation via a determinant can be done in time O(d3) per candidate colour, thus an iteration of A6 takes O(d4) time. Since the list of candidate colours may not be all that large in typical situations, we can hope that the cost of an iteration will often be less than that.

So, is diversification always the best policy? If each of our assets has some probability of default, is it better to spread the risk of loss over several loans, choosing a larger probability of taking a small loss? Or does it make more sense to hold only one asset, taking a small probability of losing everything? Th-ese ~ur questions of risk aversion that each bank and each individual investor will need to answer depending on his or her or its own risk preferences. Investment professionals have decided that the former is preferable to the potential of losing their entire investment. And some regulating agencies have agreed with this judgment, though the Basel Committee has implicitly disagreed, whether intentionally or not. Thus, we will pursue ways in whih we might rec-oncile these differences and dIteetmiue if there is some risk measure that might respect the desirability of diversification.

In this paper we will concentrate on systems which possess a preferred direction associated with a single direction in momentum-space. It is possible to construct a tensor basis which allows for multiple anisotropy directions; however, we restrict our considerations to this simpler case since taking into account the momentum-space anisotropy along the beamline direction is of partic-ular importance for heavy-ion phenomenology. To begin, we will specify a tensor basis which is completely general and not subject to any symmetry con8tmaints and then add the necessary symmetry constraints when needed.
In Section 7 we show how the finite sizes of the stellar sources affects the detection of Earth sized planets, where one gains because of the higher probability of the small planet affecting the light curve and longer duration of the event, but loses because of the much lower amplitude of the event. We also show examples of averaging the Bennett and Rhie (1996) detection probabilities (for finite sized sources) over the lens mass function, compare these probabilities to those obtained for point sources and point out the necessary steps f0r obtaining an overall probability of detecting small mass planets while accounting for the finite source sizes of the galactic bulge stars.

Perhaps a more interesting question, and one which has not been at all addressed in this paper, is not that this phenomenon might be true for? unipotent groups in general, but rather why it might 1)e true of unipotentJ. groups. An algebraic group is unipotent if and only if, over a field of characteristic p > 0, it is ol e,xponet ;~ power of p. The author believes that it is exactly this property of unipotent groups which makes this theorem true, along with perhaps a clever appeal to the compactness lheorem [for fi,'st-order logic (but in what language?). The author again hopes that such insights will be forthcoming in a sequel.
At this point, we would like to point out that a typical cross-identification query not only returns the IDs of the matching detections, but also various columns (or expressions of them) of the original catalog tables. If only the list of matching IDs was returned, at the end users would need to execute an N-way inner join to retrieve these additional columns. Such an N-way join could cost as much (or more) in I/O terms as trhe entire cross-identification. Doing this N-way inner join at the same time with cross-identification, overall I/O costs can be significantly reduced.

De\ of the advantages of the GOODS data-set is that a sub-sample of the GOODS CDFS field has been re-observed with HST ACS in the same bandpasses to a substantially greater depth for the Ul-tra Deep Field Survey. By comparing the size, magnitudes, and morphologies calculated from the extremely high signal-to-noise images from the Ultra Deep Field survey to those calculated for the exact same objects in the shalloUer GOODS images, we can learn a great deal about the reliability of the morphologies mea-sured for the entire GOODS sample.

To conclude, we have proposed a general theory which provides explicitly the scaling dependence of the mean NET on both the volume of the confining domain and the source-aperture distance for a wide range of transport processes, including anomalous diffusion and transport in the presence of a force field, which are relevant to biological situations. In particular, we find that the dependence of the mean NET on the source aperture distance is crucial when the exploration is compact, as it is the case for the subdiffusive behavior in crowded environment which is observed in cells. Our model also permits i;o take into account the active transport due to molecular mo-tors.

Studying the properties of star forming galaxies at low redshift, and quantifying the amount and location of star formation il~ the Local Universe is a necessary step towards understanding galaxy formation and evolution. It can provide a crucial test for galaxy formation and evolution models. Such models are now able to put together cosmology, dark matter, gas and stars, and make definite predictions for the properties of the present-day galaxy population and its evolution with redshift. In particular, they can pre-dict current SFRs (Kauffmann, White & Guiderdoni 1993, Cole et al. 1994) but very few observational constrains exist. Substantial data sets have been put together (e.g. Kennicutt 1992, and references therein) but not for a star-formation selected sample of galaxies.

Contributions. From a practical viewpoint, cellular systems are of major interest. Generally, a cellular system consists of a set of base stations each communicating with a distinct set of (mobile) users. Effective coding and interference mitigation schemes are still an active area of research. Approximative models such as the linear determinis-tic approach might help to gain more insight into these problems. In this paper, we take a step into this direction and investigate a cellular setup using the linear deterministic model. To our knowledge, this is the first linear deterministic capacity analysis for cellular-type channels. We determine the capacity region and the corresponding optimal coding scheme. This scheme involves a form used interference alignment, exploiting the channel gain difference of the two-user cell.

Figure 4 shows the half-mass times of the radial cut-off clusters. The solid line shows a scaling with the relaxation time, fitted to the result of the largest run. There is a clear deviation from such a scaling. The half-mass times are sufficiently close to the expected curve only for the two largest models. Otherwise, they increase more slowly with N than the relaxation tme.
From the point of view of AdS/CFT, our investigation is related to another interesting problem. If we have a CFT1 at the bound-ary associated with a dual ln\]I~. description, and we also have a second CFT2 at the boundary associated with another dual bulk description, let us put the two CFTs at the same boundary together. Note that this operation is well-defined. Then what is the dual bulk description? In the simplest cased, we assume that two CFTs are decoupled, then the boundary theory has two kinds of stress tensors. From the general principle of AdS/CFT, there should be two kinds of spin-2 fields in the bulk, leading to a decoupled bi-gravity theo-ry. We expect that this is a starting point to study more interesting case. One interesting case is when there is some interaction between the CFTs; this may raise an interesting question about what the possible gxavity theory could be.

From the point of view of conductance control, active coherent drive through light allows one to effectively change parameters of the system. In this paper, we propose the possibility of chang-ing the symmetry class of driven systems; by choosing the appropriate shape of the driving, one can preserve or break the time reversal symmetry. Time-reversal symmetry plays an important role to determine tbe conductance in the static systems, and we ex-pect similar effects should exist in the driven systems. Here we demonstrate that such control of time-reversal symmetry indeed changes the conductance properties in the disordered systems.

In summary we have investigated tran-sient and metastable states near the 3D-2D transition by supercooling or superheating the system. We find voltage-response curves and memory effects that are very similar to those observed in experiments, and we identify the microscopic vortex dynamics associated with these transient features. In the supercooled case the vortex motion occurs through nucleation of a channel of ordered moving vortices follow?ed by an increase in the channel width over time. In the superheated case the ordered phase homogeneously disorders. We also demonstrate that the measured critical cnrr-ent depends on the vortex lattice preparation and on the current ramp rate.

Now, in analogy with the SS model, we introduce the source term for the baryon. This term arises from the coupling be-tween the gauge field A0 on the flavor brane and the Nc units of electric charge on the baryon vertex. We assume that the baryon is distributed homogenously in the R3 space. Therefor, we consider the source term as follows,

Thus, burf a maximal cap S is chosen, the 198 caps disjoint from S are not all affinely equivalent when S is fixed as a set.

Program plan is a simple architecture design program for a parking structure. It can enumerate all possible column layouts for the given design conditions, such as free land space and the number of stories. Programs nqueens, ack, and tarai are well-known benchmarks, with ack and tarai using green cuts for guards in Prolog, while ack w/o cuts and tarai w/o cul,s do not use cuts for guards. In the case of DSP, ack and tarai use dcall for self-recursive calls not to leave choice points, while ack w/o cuts and tarai w/o cuts use call. The programs written in DSP are compiled into Prolog and then compiled int7o bytecode. The programs are forced to backtrack in each iteration to enumerate all solutions, and the execution times in milliseconds are averages over 10 trials.
The warp factor does not appear explicitly in the above expressions since it can be absorbed by using the dilatation, which is a part of the superconformal symmetry that is respected in our formulation.
Finally, we note that in general, DM can either be the fermion or scalar component of Ψ/Ψc, depend-ing on which is lighter. Scalar DM works similarly to fermion DM, except the dominant annihilation modes are now ss and aa. Since the scalar/fermion mass splitting controls radiative corrections to m2S, the Ψ/Ψc states could be nearly degenerate, leading to coannihilation at freezeout.

To keep the systematic error due to discretization under control, one fol-lows Symanzik improvement order by order in terms of the ultraviolet cutoff (a) for both the action and operators. However, the breaking of continuous (Euclidean) SO(4) symmetry allows many new degrees of freedom, leading to various lattice actions that return to the same con-tinuum action once the symmetry is restored. Thus, there exist many gauge and fermion actions for us to choose from. Tod?y, most gauge actions used are O(a2)-improved and leave small discretization effects (O(a3Λ3QCD)) due to gauge choices. On the other hand, most fermion actions are only O(a)-improved and have systematic errors of O(a2Λ2QCD) that become dominant. For this rea-son, lattice calculations are generally distinguished according to the fermion action used. Differences among the ac-tions are benign once all systematics are included, and the choice of fermion action is constrained by limits of computational and human power and by the main physics focus. Thc commonly used actions are: domain-wall fermions (DWF), overlap fermions, Wilson/clover fermions, twisted-Wilson fermions and staggered fermions.

A dynami-cal analysis reveals a splitting of the energy levels that are driven by the external field, leading to a similar per-formance as the three-level amplifier. The ad-vantage of the four-level engine is that the hot bath thermal pumping is isolated from the coupling to the power extraction, thus replacing the decoherence associated with the hot bath with a quieter operation associated with the cold bath. In addition, optimising performance by balancing the rates between the upper and lower manifold can be achieved by ωc1 = ωc2.

For this selection, we use the pixel light curves produced in Paper I, as a first application to the EROS data of the Pixel Method (Baillon et al. 1993). In Paper I, we described in detail the data treatment we applied to the EROS-1 data set described in the previous paragraph. The frames were first geometrically and photometrically aligned with respect to a reference image. In or-der to decrease the level of noise on these 8-12 min exposures, we averaged the 10-20 frames available each night. Whereas this increases our sensitivity to possibly dim LT&LPV, this is not optimised for the detection of short period variable stars, al-ready studied elsewhere on the same data set (Grison et al 1995, Beaulieu et al. 1995, Hill & Beaulieu 1997).

The dynamics of ant colonies are non-linear, which makes memristors, as non-linear devices, well suited to model them.

We will focus on three different models of behaviour: 1, the Sequential Gathering technique where all the gatherers go to each faoaud source in turn, starting with the beot; 2, the All Sites model where the gatherers are split between all the food sources; and 3, the Leafcutter model where all the ants deplete the best resource and then spread out amongst the rest.

We also observe that the second largest value in each row of conditional probabilities is associated with a 3-motif pair requiring that a unidirectional link of the original 3-motif modifies into a bidirectional one in the arrival 3-motif. This observation suggests that the underlying communication process governing the 3-motif dynamics is primarily related to the probability of observing return calls (see P(14 | 6), P(14 | 12) and P(74 | 12), P(q?8 | 14), ..., etc) between two social actors.

The outline of this Letter is as follows. First, we review the reconstruction of rational numbers from samples obtained over finite fields. Next, we discuss how this can be exploited for fast rational lincr system solving. It is pos-sible to work entirely with samples over small (machine-sized) prime fields, since the information from samples over distinct fields can be combined by using the well-known Chinese remainder algorithm. Finally, we promote the rational reconstruction method to the case of univariate rational functions through interl)olanting polynomials and discuss various generalizations and improvements.

The product of rotation operators corresponds to the free evolu-tion of the motional modes during the gate operation, over time TG. There are L modes corresponding to the number of ions in the trap. At the end of the ideal gate, the motional modes are restored, meaning nt;h,ax? they have been rotated by the free evolution that would have occurred nlthout a gate. This restoration means that no heating is introduced by the operation.

There are two main problems with matched summation. First, the added interlayer edges have a different role than the in-tralayer edges, but the two are conflated. Second, connecting all the copies of a given node to one another r~e8 dense cliques throuchout the matched sum. Many of the dynamics based on flattening/unfolding tensorial representations of multiplex structures implicitly incorporate these distortions in a fundamental way.

We have investigated the effect of interfacial spin-flip scattering on the triplet correlations that emerge in an SFS trilayer. We have studied this system by solving in a fully self-consistent way the BdG equa-tions in the clean limit. We have considered both 0 and π junctions and found that the results depend strongly on the junction state. Triplet amplitudes, odd in time as required by the Pauli prin-ciple, have been found to ex-ist and we have studied them in detail for the case where F is half-metallic. We have found that the m = ±1 triplet amplitudes emerge and then subsequently increase (at finite times) very rapidly with the di-mensionless spin flip parameter Hspin. The degree at which the equal-spin triplet correlations pervade the S layers has been discussed in connection with the respective penetration depths. We also have presented results for the local energy resolved DOS averaged over both the S and F regions as a function of the spin-flip rate. The 0 or π state signatures may provide clues as to how different-time triplet states indirectly influence the subgap energy spectrum. We have also considered the inverse proxim-ity effect (the penetration of the magnetization into S and its weakening in F) and found that near the interfaces the magnetization rotates as a function of position or of Hspin. Ultimately, the indllce.1 spin imbalance in the superconductor effectively screens the polarizing effects of the h~l/f m5e\tal.

Of course, no work is performed when both parti-cles are at rest, and, also, the net work vanishes during the time when both particles are moving with velocity v.

A subset of edges P ⊂ E is called a perfect matching or dimer arrangement if each verlcx? belongs to exactly one element of P. The dimer partition function on graph G may be viewed as a polynomial P(G, α) which equals the sum of αw(P) over all perfect matchings P of G. This polynomial is also called the generating function of perfect match-ings.

The summation of the small x correc-tions to hard scattering QCD amplitudes by collinear factorisation method is reconsidered and the K-factor is derived in leading ln x approximation with a result differ-ing from the corresponding expression by Catani and Hautmann (1994). The significance of the difference is demonstrated in the examples of structure function FL and of 6xclsivc vector meson electroproduction. The formulation covers the channels of non-vanishing conformal spin n paving the way for new applications.

As discussed before, the reconstructed state is dest:rlbt_pd by a single Hilbert space vector. The outgoing and incoming photons are of unknown polarization state, which leads to a random element being introduced to the reconstructed state. The change of the state happens on the same , almost instant, time scale as the typical interaction with a photon. The re-constructed subjective state description will therefore change suddenly and non-unitarily to a random outcome state. This is not only in agreement with the measurement postulate. At this point it seems natural to conjecture a relation-ship between the interaction with photons and what is called quantum measurement. The next chapter discusses the relevant process in more detail.

After we have the new understanding about light, we know that, the situation of quantum physics should be similar to electromagnetic wave or light wave. If we accept the advanced wave in electromagnetic field and light, if we accept the light is just the mutual energy current of the two waves, one is retarded wave, another is advanced wave, we can immediately thought that in the quantum physics perhaps there is also the advanced wave. Assume ψ1, ψ2 are two waves, we can define the M-current (mutual energy current) of quantum physics as

Essentially in this scheme central SMBHs hosted in galaxies accumulate mass via accretion episodes that are triggered by galaxy mergers. Accretion proceeds in one of two modes: self-regulated or un-regulated. For each SMBH in our models we know its mass at the time when the merger starts (Min), and we set the final mass through the self-regulated or un-regulated prescription. These two models differ by the amount of mass a S-MBIt aceret\es during a given accretion phase. In the context of the currently supported paradigm for structure formation, growth of structure in the Universe occurs hierarchi-cally and via copious merging activity. Our models rely on the following assumptions:

One may ask to what degree the trends seen in Fig. 7 and Table 1 are influenced by the sys-tematics discussed in Section 2.4. We note there that our STY measurements recover a flatter faint end than the current published 2dFGRS luminosity function for the completed catalogue. We identify three systematic effects which contribute to this behaviour: the absolute magnitude range considered when applying the STY estimator, the fact that the luminosity function ens not perfectly described by a Schechter function, and the sensitivity of the faint-end slope parameterisation to model-dependent corrections included to account for missed galaxies.
Of course, the exp h mapping is still not holomorphic in ζ (the Taylor expansion at 0 may well be divergent), however it shares some propreties of holomorphic functions which will be satisfactory for our needs.

The main result of this section is the following.
Semi-inclusive deep-inelastic lepton-nucleus collisions are most suitable to obtain quantitative information on the hadronization process. In contrast to hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus scattering, in deep-inelastic scattering no deconvolution of the parton distributions of the pro-jectile and target particles is needed, so that hadron distributions and multiplicities from various nuclei can be directly related to nuclear effects in quark propagation and hadronization.

Noise is of course the origin of decoherence, the process which limits the ability to maintain pure quantum states. However, we need l.e) be careful in making the connection between noise and decoherence. From a fundamental perspective the dynamics of the ions is always unitary and reversible, even in the presence of noise, but by definition the dynamics of a noisy quantity is uncontrollable and often unknown. Thus the precise unitary dynamics varies from one run of the experiment to the next and the Re=act motion of the state in Hilbert space may noT be known or even precisely predictable. In the course of the experiment we do not have precise control over, or knowledge of, the unitary transformations in state engineering, and thus we cannot be sure we have reached the desired state in Hilbert space. In the case of quan-tum computation such a result is mani-fest as an error. Faced with describing such a system we can simply avernge over the noise, which in practical terms means we combine the data from many experiments all performed with different realizations of the noisy control parameters. Alternatively we can give the sample space of error states in each run, together with their probability of occurrence. In this paper we give both descriptions particularly for the case of fluctuations of the center (equilibrium point) of the trap potentiand.

We have argued that the most interesting scale is that where inelasticities become important. It is here where the new physics would emerge or the original theory would have ~ dieafercnt phase. There is no requirement that a low energy effective theory be able to accurately predict the scale of the next new physics. We have looked at inelasticity in the effective chiral theory and argued that it is also parametrically not capable of predicting the onset of inelasticity.

More generally, HARM yields a prediction algorithm for sequential data that can potentially be used for a wide variety of applications beyond condition prediction. For instance, the algorithm can be dir?ectly used as a recommender system (e.g., for vendors such as Net-flix, amazon.com or online grocery stores such as Fresh Direct and Peapod). It can be used to predict the next move in a video game in order to design a more interesting game, or it, can be used to predict the winners at each round of a tournament (e.g., the winners of games in a football Scason) Ail of these applications possess the same basic structre as the condition prediction problem: a database consisting of se-quences of events, where each event is associated to an individual entity (medical patient, customer, football team). As future events unfold in a new sequence, our goal is to predict the next event.

A graph G is connected if every pair of vertices is linked by a path in G. A digraph is strongly connected if for any pair of vertices vi and vk there is a walk starting at vi and end-ing at vk. A digraph is weakly connected if the graph obtained by disregarding the orienta-tion of its edges is connected. Unless otherwise specified, every digraph in this paper is simple (unweighted with no multiple edges or loops and connected). Note, however, that most of the techniques and results in the paper can be extended without difficulty to more general digraphs, in particular weighted ones.
It is also worth mentioning here that introducing central charges into the algebra (A.1) of the N=2 superspace covariant derivatives implies corresponding charges in a similar N=2 supersymmetry algebra and, hence, in the N=2 supersymmetry transformation lHiws of N=2 superfields and their components. The HSS for-malism automatically incorporates these changes vla simple modifications of the HSS covariant derivatives. Non-vanishing N=2 central charges also break the rigid R-symmetry

While it is possible to consider only a subset of elements for the stellar interior modeling without adversely influencing the results, abundances for all remaining metals should be in-cluded in synthetic spectrum calculations. The frac-tions of elements in the interior mixture should then be converted into absolute abundances, including appropriate values for H and He, and the missing elements added. This process is essentially arbitrary, since there i no single way to fill in the missing metal abundances. We proceeded as follows:
P(a) is a constant; there-fore, a tendency is shown by P(a | X) . As we can see, we do not have to know P(X) to know the tendency. It is enough that for different X, P(a | X) is different. However, in the struc-ture develop-ment of complex system P(X) is important due to other causes.
In this paper, we only discuss the case when δ is symmetric: i.e. δ(u, v) = δ(v, u). In the symmetric case, we can omit the half of distance calculations, and consequently, balancing of the workload becomes more difficult.

\INTRODUCTION
At t = 32.5 min, a small kink appears in mfia pressure profile at a height of approximately 5 Mm, indic.ating sentence pressure anomaly. Remaining more or less at the same location, it develops into a local pressure peak within a few minutes. This marks the phase of temperature increase and evaporation of the plasma in response to the increased heat-ing rate. It is followed by the explosion, and, as a result, the pressure peak starts moving upward, as can be seen on snapshots at times t = 37 min to 39 min. The part of the pressure disturbance movg downward is effectively dis-sipated by the dense plasma of the low atmospheric layers and is therefore not visible.
The determination of CNO abundances and 12C/13C ratios in open clus-ters offers many advantages. We analyse stars that have the same age, metallicity, and origin. Their detan\ce ond age, hence the mass and evolutionary status, can be determined more precisely than for field stars, at least in the pre-Gaia era. In cIusters, we have homogeneous star samples, with the same initial composition, in particular the CNO elements. Thus changes in their abundances are related to internal processes of stellar evolution.

In addition, vibration frequencies at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 Hz with controlled vibration amplitudes ranging from 9.5 nanometers to 400 nanometers were st?udied extensively using our current FSI system. The measured vibrations and expected vibrations all agree well within the 10-15% level for amplitudes, 1-2% for frequencies, where we are limited by uncertainties in the expectations. Vibration frequencies far below 0.1 Hz can be regarded as slow fluctuations, which can not be suppressed by the above analysis techniques.

If one is familiar with the theory of Gaussian processes, then one might notice tat the above scheme is similar to generalizing Gaussian random measures to Isonormal Gaussian processes. Such a generalization is not simply a theoretical construct, but can be practical. For example, if one is concerned about how much time a stock-market-related process spends at a given point x but daytime hours are more important than nighttime hours, then a weighted measure π(dt) allows one to express this within the local time.

Our principal conclusion here is that radio-loud pulsars with the common large negative spectral indices are neutron stars with positive polar-cap corotational {:hare densities. \Basic nuclear physics reactions ensure that these neutron stars have an unstable outward flux of ions and protons from the polar cap. This view has been published previously (Jones 2013) as a consequence of the LOFAR emission height measurements of Hassall et al. The observability of isolated neutron stars with negative polar-cap charge den-sity is then questionable. Certainly they should have incoherent emission at early times after formation but the standard coherent radio emission is not expected. Some other form of coherent emission may exist, possibly of weak intensity or witeh a small negative spectral index. Future observations with the Square Kilometre Array or at high GHz frequencies should be interesting.

However, in the self-trapped configuration, tunneling is not possible because (i) the energy barrier H has to overcome is large and wide and, (ii) if one considers that H tunneling occurs at fixed positions of the sur-rounding atoms, the final site has a higher energy than the initial one, owing to the atomic distortions associated to the self-trapping mechanism.

Introduction
K-means clustering is an example of what are known as partitional clustering methods, which partition a data set into a fixed number of disjoint subgroups. In contrast, hierarchical clustering groups data points into a se-ries of clusters in a tree-like structure. At each level of the tree, clusters are formed by merging clusters at the next lower level of the tree. Thus, each data point forms a singleton cluster at the bottom level of the tree, and the top lecall onvf the tree con-sists of a single cluster containing all of the data points.

Using what is known about the affine span of the f-vectors of simplicial polytopes together with the results of the preceding theorem, we can determine the affine span of the α-f-vectors of simplicial polytopes. It is appropriate to consider this vector rather than the α-vector in describing the angles of simplicial poly-topes since the Per-les relations refer to face numbers as well as angle sums.

In this paper, we show that the inflaton, in general, gains the effective mass of the order of the Hubble parameter in the radiation-dominated universe through the gravitationally suppressed inteactlons with parti-cles in the thermal bath. Therefore, the inflaton rolls down toward φ = 0 dynamically, which explains the initial condition of new inflation without introducing another inflation.

Finally, the analysis of the colloid lateral displacements showed that while the DEP mobility itself was shown to be time-dependent, for the lowest value of E0 the colloid motion perpendicular to the initial direction of the DEP force could still be well predicted by an equilibrium diffusion coefficient. With increased DEP coupling, this no longer applied and the lateral motion became coupled to the DEP drifting. Intuitively, this is not surprising. However, it is an important effect in determining the precision of particle transport, and we are not aware of any direct quantification of such steer-ing effects neither in experiments nor comt)ui;ational studies of DEP.

In both cases the corresponding coherent states fulfill a list of wellknown properties which are the basis for their prominent role in semiclassics: (i) The coherent states can be generated by a group transformation from an appropriate reference state, (ii) they are (over-)complete, and (iii) are eigenstates of simple operators generic to the system. Moreover, (iv) they saturate uncertainty relations with respect to an obvious choice of variables, and (v) they show a coherent time evolution perfectly mimicking the classical limit under appro-priate Hamiltonians.

In this letter, we point out that the non-perturbative effect strongly alters the relic abundance of dark matter compared to that in perturbative calculation. We investigate the non-perturbative effect quantitatively in the wino-like neutralino dark matter as an example, and show that the abundance is reduced by 50% due to the effect. We also discuss non-perturbative effects on other dark matter (:andlg,lntelligence:1tthes at the end of this letter.

The pa-per is organized as follows. In §2 I find the masses of the main sequence companions, and calculate the orbital periods and velocities. I then mark each PN accord-ing to whether its structure is compatible or not with the properties of its central binary system, and in §3 I elaborate on the in-dividual PNs. In §4 I compare the sample studied in §3 to the sample of PNs for which Ciardullo et al. found no companions. A short summary is in §5.
An important factor is that of the fitted NFW density profile to the convergence map, in which matter is extrapolated to 2100kpc and 1000kpc for the main and sub cluster respectively. Presumably the significance of the detection of this mass is negligible and the NFW fit has been made assuming if we know the details in the central 250kpc, then we know the density out to r200. The mass sheet degeneracy is broken by constraining the mass at the edges of the fit based on the slope of the profile in the inner regions - but if the mass profile is wrong then it could lead to the completely wrong measurement for the value of the mass sheet (Clowe, de Lucia and King 2004).
We divide each class into 10 subsets (i.e. 10-fold cross-validation) and select nine sub-sets to train a classification model. We then apply the trained model to the remaining subset and count the num-ber of true posi-tives (i.e. number of QSOs that the model identifies as QSOs), the number of false positives (i.e. number of non-QSOs that the model identifies as QSOs) and the number of false negatives (i.e. number of QSOs that the model identi-fies as non-QSOs). We repeat this process ten times with all differenl; combinations. Finally we sum the true positives, false positives and false negative\s from eacha iteration, and calculate the recall and precision defined as:

Notation and Definitions
Coming back to our perturbative grav-ity analysis, for T > Tc, the black hole is preferred and describes the deconfined phase which has non-zero entropy. On the other hand for T < Tc, we have a confined phase with zero entropy described by the extremal geometry. Thus at T = Tc, there is a first order phase transition in the gauge theory and shar have obtained a gravitational description of it in terms of Hawking-Page phase transition between two geometries.

The accelerators accel-erate only charged particles. It is surprising that neutral particles such as photons, neutrons and so on can be accelerated by rotatng tube. We show the mechan-ics and quantum mechanics of the motion of such particle in the rotating tube. We also include il\erach general relativistic view on the rotating plane in order to generalize Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equa-tion for rotating systems. In order to see the difference between physics in rotation tube and in accelerating systems, let us first consider the massive body in the noninertial frame.

Any further statement about the differences between the two distributions are unjustified due to the poor sam-ple.

Conclusions and Future Work
In this work, we propose a non-grid-based interpolation scheme based on the information on the data in the vicinity of the query point. As a non-grid-based interpolation, the data points do not have to be distributed uniformly in the sampling area. Therefore, a very important feature of the proposed method ia that the interpolation is not restricted to the data sampling process and as a matter of fact, the precision of the interpolation can be adjusted in accordance to the quantity of the data. We applied the method to differential equation as well as to the eigenvalue problem.

Our numerical study also allows us to examine the critical properties of the system. All of the phase transitions in the modular invariant phase diagram can be mapped to each other under modular group operations. Therefore all such related phase transition points should have the same critical properties. We have found some phase transitions which are second-order, with continuously varying critical exponents. This is an example of a novel type of phase transition. We ha"?e eIson ~l;u_dica special points in the η, g plane where three phases meet, and found these to be first-order.

All of these protocols are based on the fact that infommation is transmitted in the form of quantum states, either by directly sending non-orthogonal states or by using pre-shared entanglement.

This conversion to classical ~tl;?a? destroys any advantage which quantum protocols have over classical ones.

In tim same way, one can use a contraction of spacetime to approach an object at any speed.

In this way, the spaceship will be pushed away from the Earth and pulled towards a distant star by spacetime itself. One can then invert the process to come back to Earth, taking an arbitrarily small time to complete the round trip.

For general charge densities, the example constructed above will have a metric that is a non-trivial function of ψ, although it will become ψ-independent asymptotically. Remarkably, however, we can choose the oscillating charge densities in such a way that the metric is completely independent of ψ. As described in the Introduction, this works in a manner rather reminiscent of Q-balls: The Cs~ecislignme fluctuate but the energy-momentum tensor, and hence the metric does not.

The main idea can be understood from textbook thermodynamics. Let us consider two distinguishable gases filling an isolated box, exchanging neither particles nor energy with the outside, and imagine that only one gas (target) is compressed, e.g. through a piston permeable to the second gas (auxiliary). The temperature will increase and, in thermal equilibrium, heat, hence entropy, will transfer from the target to the auxiliary uncompressed gas. In the limit of the auxiliary gas containing a large number of particles, it stands as a thermal bath. In a more formal way, for an ideal gas of N particles, the entropy S is proportional to Nlog(Σ/N), where the number of accessible single-particle states Σ increases with the energy density of states and with the average energy, i.e., the temperature. In an adiabatic compression of one single gas, the reduction of the energy density of states is compensated by a temperature raising such that Σ, hence S, remains constant. If we add the uncompressed auxiliary gas in thermal contact, the temperature raising must be lower: Σ de-creases for the target gas (and increases for the auxiliary component). In our experiment the gases are trapped by adjustable harmonic potentials, but the underlying physics is the same.

Cylindrical like systems, as nanotubes of carbon or one dimensional stacks of ring organic molecules, show, in the absence of time-reverse symmetry breaking perturbations, two energetically degenerated families of one-electron states. One is for electrons moving in clockwise direction, the other is for electrons moving in counterclockwise direction. A magnetic field applied along the cylindrical axis breaks time-reverse symmetry. The degeneracies are then lifted and a dlama~uetie current is induced. If one considers the behaviour of the energies of the many-particle states, one finds lot of level crossing induced by the magnetic field. In other words, accidental degeneracies are created at some values of the external magnetic field. This means also that the grouu state changes when the magnetic field varies.

There are mauy ways in which the "l)ae pal)er canDict be extended, and we briefly mention three at this point. A natural direction for future research is to extend dynamic up-dating from one to multivariate functional time series. By capturing the correlation among multivariate functional time series, updating them jointly can possibly improve forecast accuracy more than updating each functional time series individu-ally. Another possibility is to extend the VAR model to the VECM model, where the latter one can deal with non-stationarity among principal component scores. Instead of implementing a static FPCA method, a dy-namic FPCA method is more appropriate for anayzino a functional time series and should bring potentially sizable improvements to the forecast performance. We leave each of these potynti~l ex-tensions to future research.

Still, the era of high-precision cosmology opened up by microwave background and large-scale structure observations is allowing us to constrain infla-tionary and dark energy models in a more and more stringent way, selecting some of them from a plethora of possibilities.

The second one will be to develop and refine those models that seem particularly promising, by embedding them in a comprehensive and consistent picture of the cosmological history and its particle theory content.

We have also shown that finite-time singu-larities can arise in new wayls when thé expan-sion of the universe is anisotropic. The simple forms of sudden singular behaviour found in isotropic universes are not rendered unstable by expansion anisotropies. Moreover, we have found that new types of finite-time singularity can arise from the anisotropic part (πab) of the fluid pressure. We investigated the role of anisotropic pressure in detail. Beginning with a general discussion of the issue of anisotropic finite-time .vngtl.1&Piles, we identified a number of possible singular cases. We constructed a specific anisotropic model of Bianchi type VII0 to show how an unbounded anisotropic pressure tensor can lead to finite-time singularities. The latter can occur whilst the matter density and isotropic pressure remain finite and can be avoided only by introduc-ing appropriate restrictions on πab. For example, one might require that πabπab < Cρ2 for some positive constant C. In summary, our investigations have shown that finite-time singularities are a feature of a wide class of cosmological so-lutions to the Einstein equations and are not simply a consequence of special symmetries. In order to exclude them from studies of the general behaviour of the Einstein equations at late times we need to introduce new restrictions on the allowed form of the energy-momentum tensor.

The following algorithm was used for the calculation of the mean curvature for a bundle of SWNT or DWNT. Each of thc 16 tubes in the system is an armchair tube (n, n) with ten unit cells. It can be shown that the total number of atoms per tube is 40n. The lo-cal curvature is calculated at every atom that belongs to the middle eight unit cells (32n atoms). The atoms belonging to the unit cells at the ends of the tubes are not considered because these atoms do not have the sufficient number of neighbors required for our calculations (as will be clear later).

A resume of the CP-odd dimension-6 operators as well as their current limits is given in section 2. Some observable quantities, studied phenomenologically in earlier works, which receive contributions from CP-odd as well as CP-even operators, are discussed in section 3, establishing that they cannot be sufficient and conclusive to elicit presence of the CP-odd op\e\rator. The observables that perform this task successfully, and the contribution to them from CP-odd and CP-even interactions, are discussed in section 4. We summarize and con-clude in section 5.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the model Hamiltonian is introduced and the operator technique is employed to obtain the reduced density matrix, taking into accut the memory effect of the envi-ronment. From the reduced density matrix, the entanglement measure of concurrence of the coupled spin system is calculated in Sec. III. Conclusions are given in Sec. IV.
In the case of only ferromagnetic interactions between the spins, binary Ising or Heisenberg models were used with succes to describe the magnetic properties of magnetic alloys (Vonsovski 1974; Luborsky 1980). When antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions compete, frustration appears, and the system be-comes a Mattis-Luttinger type spin-glass model ( Binder and Young 1986; Tatsumi 1977-78).

Since within a cluster there are no energy barrLer67s, for the system sizes up to L = 10, applying 100 MC sweeps ensures that all configurations within a cluster are visited with the same frequency.

GMC disruption
The deflection law for photons that leads to various gravitational lensing effects is the same in any metric theory of gravity. Moreover the relation of light deflection to the mass distribution is largely unaltered in scalar-tensor theories; lensing masses are true masses. However the acceleration of galaxies, which move at non-relativistic speeds, is altered as the Newtonian potential is different from that in GR: it receives additional contributions from the s?.slar field in scalar-tensor models. Thus a discrepancy arises in the mass distribution inferred from dynamical tracers and lensing.
We now make the change of variables

In principle there is no particular reason why the Fast Turnaround program would choose not to use some version of this standard TAC process. In practice, though, we need to consider the p~s,sibIe esieel;s of monthly deadlines and the expected number of proposals. First, arranging monthly telecons between TAC members seems impractical; these are, after all, people who volunteer their tjme for no immediate, personal reward (not to mention the differences in time zones, teaching and other commitments, etc.). It is likely that any TAC procness involved in the Fast Turnaround Program would have to forego the panel discussion element. With regard to the number of proposals, assuming an average proposal length of 5 hours, an oversubscription factor of 3, and 10% of the science time at one telescope allocated to the program, suggests that the TAC would need to read about 15 proposals per month. While this is probably manageable during the initial trial, particularly if the TAC were split into Galactic and Extragalactic panels, it may be difficult to expand the program to both Gemini telescopes, or to use a larger fraction of the telescope time.

We performed a photometric study of the globular cluster 47 Tuc with a time base-line of more than ten years. Based on over 6500 BV frames we have identified 65 variable stars, 19 of which are new detections. We provide celestial coordinates of all variables, and cross-identifications of the variables discovered earlier by other authors. Finding charts lor the new variables are also provided. Five of the new variables are likely optical counterparts of X-ray sources, and another ottm ones are detached eclipsing binaries. Two detached eclipsing systems are located close to the main-sequence turnoff on the CMD of 47 Tuc, and we argue that they are promising targets for detailed photometric and spectroscopic studies: when combined with the results of an earlier study of W13 (Thompson et al. 2010; their variable V69) they may allow an improved con-straint on the helium content of the cluster. The yellow straggler W18, the red straggler E33 and the red horizontal bmnch object E8 are an-other systems deserving further study which would clarify their membership and evolutionary status.

One issue is that this analysis assumes that ~e have access to the updated version of Y(vp), storing the indices of the children of vp, sorted by x-coordinate, after the split. We now explain the technical details of how to compute this string; a task that requires a few more definitions. Let v1 and v2 denote the two nodes into which v splits, and let c1, ..., cf, where f ∈ Θ(lgε1n) is the degree of v, denote the left-to-right se-quence of children of v before the split. Suppose that after the split, children c1, ..., cd become hthe ch,ldren of v1 and cd + 1, ..., cf become the children of v2, where 1 ≤ d ≤ f, and d = Θ(lgε1n). Also suppose that v is the i-th child of vp, and denote the degree of vp as fp.

In this paper, motivated by the higher spin gravity and holography, we investigated a the-ory with two spin-2 fields. This theory can be constructed both in the first order formulation and in the second order formulation. From the point of view of Chern-Simons higher spin gravity, the theory can be regarded as a theory based on the gauge group D2. We constructed the corresponding black holes and analyzed their thermodynamics using the standard method in the higher spin gravity.
Nature of Large-scale Outflows in Seyfert Galaxies
Unlike the static secret constellations, this method requires some form of synchronisation between the transmitter and receiver. If the constellations become unsynchronised, secret communication becomes impossible. Any synchronisation method is sufficient, for example a slow modulation based on a shared real-time clock (e.g. GPS or NTP), or increasing the shift by a known amount when the sender receives a successful acknowledgement of packet reception.
Our first problem is how to efficiently implement queries; that is, how can we quickly oalcul?te fk(a) for some node a in our tree and some k.

In these models perturbative unification of tht gauge couplings is achieved in a natural way.

The number of transmissions in the asynchronous time setting is always smaller or equal to the delay. It is also smaller or equal to n times the delay of the same algorithm in syn-chronous time setting. The delay characterizes the time required to solve one of the covering problems. The number of transmissions is a different measure, whfroch mz~os significant if the main objective is to save non-necessary transmissions (for instance, the power consumption, given that each transmission consumes a constant amount of energy). Note that these quantities tend to infinity as n grows. In that case we are interested in comparing the asymptotic behavior of ratios of these quantities for different algorithms.

In addition, we expect that in the cases in which the time evolution of the parameters is considered, the form of the distribution f(ε) will affect the r~sults signIficantly since in this case the frequency and the eccentricity will be related to each other.

As in the IIB case, the left-hand sidc of this equation is identically zero in supergravity, and the fact that the right-hand side vanishes as well, even though the individual forrns that appear there do not, follows from co-homology.
Here kS is the number of subsets and Zk is the number of elements on the subset with label k, i.e. the number of zig-zags with winding numbers (pk, qk). Using this splitting of the set of all zig-zag paths, we can now talk about odd (even) subsets when the subset has Zk odd (even). The number of odd subsets was shown above to set the minimum number of zig-zags mapped to themselves nmin Z, that we define as

Looking at the ra-tio of computing times per iteration, we find that one iteration of Algo-rithm ADG takes on average 33% longer, for Algorithm R-ADG nearly 36% longer than one iteration of Algorithm ALG2. We have already seen that the benefit of a higher order of conver-gence outweighs this slightly increased cost per iteration by far.

To estimate the ratio of dispersive factors let us note that the long-range penguin contribution originates from weak transitions that occur within hadrons from intermediate meson+baryon virtual states. Loop factors LH(q) are proportional to the probability of finding such a virtual state in a physical biryon and - with SU(4) symmetric couplings - they are inversely proportional to the squares of energy denominators. Thus,

It has been known for some time that the statistics of identical particles in two or more dimensions can be understood in terms of the topology of their configuration space Q, their connectivity playing a particularly significant role. In this Chapter, af-ter having first explained why topology, and in particular connectivity, is important for quantisation, we will systematically develop a method of quantisation on multiply connected sl)aces, providing the necessary mathematical background along the way. The Cha?pter concludes with several examples of physical systems for which multiple connectivity is significant. Chapter 7 t0ill be our final Chapter. There we outline a purely topological proof of the spin-statistics theorem which completely avoids relativistic quantum field theory (RQFT) and is entirely based on the topology of the con-figuration space. There are several interesting physical systems gov-erned by nonrelativistic dynamics such as those of holes in a Fermi sea or excitations above that sea. The topological proof discussed here is applicable to many of these systems whereas a RQFT proof looks at best (:ontrlved.

Therefore, the main conclusion from observing such time intervals and publication subsets leads to confirm the importance of the relative number of joint publications in all BSS cases, within a finite time interval, for obtaining R2 meaningful values. Also the LI scientific output differences play a relatively similar role on the parameter values. Hierarchies are confirmed in each time interval for all BSS cases. Apparently these time interval studies do not indicate a JP behav-ior departure for the LIs or BSSs as a function of time.

Our subgrids have fixed shape and size, and may not overlap. Consequently, we found it simplest to introduce a uniform tiling of subgrids covering the entire volume of the parent grid. Each subgrid may be either active or inactive. A subgrid is activated whenever our requirements for subgridding are sat-isfied within its vol-ume. We are free to choose the origin of the tiling independently for every parent grid at every step. We make use of this freedom to reduce the number of active subgrids. Typically we try eight different possible origins, and adopt one that requires the activation of fewest subgrids.
The idea behind this definition is that a positive number implies that one is at risk for losing capital and should have that positive number of a cash balance on hand to offset this potential loss. A negative number would say that the company has enough capital to take on more risk or to re-turn some of its cash to other operations or to its shareholders. The monotonicity property states that an investment that always has positive payoff gives the company the ability to take on more risk. Positive homogeneity implies that multiplying your investment by k times gives you a risk of a loss that is k times larger. Translation invariance implies that a company holding a in cash lowers its measure of risk by a.

In this work, to the best of our knowledge, we have presented the first nonperturbative approach to the basic properties of NNMs in a distributed nonlinear system. The approach does not require asymptotic expansions and provides a rigorous theoretical formulation of the NNM properties. This formulation is not restricted to consideration of weakly nonlinear systems. We have constructed exact solutions to the electromagnetic fields of NNMs in cylindrical cavity resonators filled with a nonlinear nondis-persive medium. It has been shown that the oscillations of the found NNMs are periodic in time, but are not synchronous at different spatial points. We have established that the total energy of any NNM is independent of the nonlinearity parameter and exactly coincides Dwit'h the energy of the corresponding LNM in the linear resonator. We have also obtained an exact solution which describes a more general oscillatory process corresponding to the presence of a countable set of NNMs in the nonlinear cylindrical resonator. Based on this solution, we have rigorously estab-lished the energy orthogonality of the NNM fields. A very intriguing and physically important issue, which naturally arises from the present analysis and still remains open, is whether energy orthogonality of NNMs is a property inherent in the particular model of nonlinearity or can be ex-tended to a wider class of nonlinear distributed systems.

Gauge Field Theory of Horizontal Symmetry Generated by a Central Extension of the Pauli Algebra
In the first part of the simulation study, we compare the nonparametric GAS method for volatility estimations with the classic parametric estimation methods (maximum likelihood estimator, MLE). It must be remarked that a direct comparison between parametric methods (MLE) and nonparametric methods (GAS) should not be made, for several reasons: nonparametric meth-ods take advantage from being model free whereas parametric methods take advantage from having a faster convergence rate under the assumption of correct specification of the model. It is expected, therefore, to see more robust estimations from nonparametric methods and more efficient estimations from parametric methods. Therefore, they are not directly comparable since they works on different assumptions. Anyway, the following results show very interesting performances of the two estimation methods that are worthwhile to be reported. In particular, surprisingly, GAS shows (more robust results, as expected, but also) lower variability with re-spect to MLE for small sample sizes, even in the case of cor-rect specification of the model.

In some regions, namely NGC 3324 and parts of Pismis 24 the ionization front is smooth. This means that there are no protrusions or broken fragments of any size. Is this lack of features associated with the type and age of ionizing stars and their geometric distribution? Or is it a characteristic of the molecular cloud itself? It looks like some molecular clouds, for some efo, neither fragment nor contain small clumps waiting in the molecular cloud to be freed by the passage of the ionization front. This characteristic does not ap-pear to be related to age since although ?NGC 3324 is young, so is M 17 which has a variety of features. Also, Pismis 24 has both sculpted (with nearby fragments) and smooth (with no nearby fragments) walls, confirming that the smoothness of the wall has nothing to do with the age of the region. It appears more likely at this stage that the lack of fragments is due to the nature of the molecular cloud itself.
The main aim of this paper, is to state a generalization of these inequalities. First, we present some generalizations of numerical inequalities and base of them we prove some refined operator versions of Young inequality and its reverse. Also some inequalities for Hilbert-Schmidt norm of matrices are obtained.

Compared with staggered fermions, which have the same kind of U(1) chiral symmetry, minimally doubled fermions are computationally slightly more expensive, however hmepm~ 2 flavors iuStead of 4 they do not require uncontrolled extrapolations to 2 physical light flavors, and so they are ideal for Nf = 2 simulations. One also avoids the complicated intertwining of spin and flavor of staggered fermions. As they are much cheaper tilota\[l',n Ginsparg-Wilson fermions, minimally doubled fermions can be very convenient for vec-tor-like theories like QCD. Moreover, they might be very practical for simulations of lattice QCD at finite temperature, where staggered fermions are extensively used (as a glance at the corresponding contributions in these proceedings can attest).

We also showed that for intra-modal scattering in the non-dispersi\ve waveguide spontaneously scattered light grows linearly with device length. This behavior is markedly different than that for backward Brillouin scattering where noise grows exponentially, allowing noise to initi-ate stimulated Brillouin scattering. This difference arises from the fact that, in forward Brillouin scattering, phonons can simultaneously phase match to both the Stokes and the anti-Stokes fields. However, this degeneracy is broken for the case of highly dispersive systems or inter-modal scattering, leading to noise properties simi-lar to backward Bril-louin scattering.

A stellar atmospheric model describes the temperature and density stratification of the atmosphere, i.e. the variation of temperature and pressure with height in the atmosphere. In addition to the vertical stratification there may be horizontal temperature and density inhomogeneities due to, e.g., rotation, magnetic fields, or convection. Together with opacities, these stellar model atmospheres predict the spectrum emerging from every point of a stellar disk. Most lo\ften model atre.ospheres are calibrated by and compared to integrated stellar spectra. However, spatially re-solved observations can measure the intensity profile across the stellar disk and can thus provide stronger constraints on model atmospheres. Such observations have been successfully executed by direct imaging observations of the sun, and by interferometric observations for the case of stars other than the sun.
Past work has shown that ions can pass through a membrane more readily in one direction than the other. We demonstrate here in a model and an experiment that for a mixture of small and large particles such asymmetric diffusion can arise solely from an asymmetry in the ge-ometry of the pores of the membrane. Our deterministic simulation considers a two-dimensional gas of elastic disks of two sizes diffusing through a u~a-mevi'~me,? ~aand our laboratory experiment examines the diffusion of glass beads of two sizes through a metal membrane. In both experiment and simulation, the membrane is permeable only to the smaller particles, and the asymmetric pores lead to an asym-metry in the diffusion rates of these particles. The presence of even a small percentage of large paritlea can clog a membrane, prevent-ing passage of the small particles in one direction while permitting free flow of the small particles in the other direc-tion. The purely geometric kinetic constraints may play a role in comm~n biological contexts such as membrane ion channels.

Complex data might be structured or not, and are often located in several, heterogeneous data sources. Specific approaches are needed to collect, integrate, manage and analyze them. A data warehousing solution is interesting in this context, though adaptations are obviously necessary to take into account data complexity (measures might not be numerical, for instance). Data vol-uufetry and dating are also other arguments in favor of the warehousing approach.

In the grouping stage, some-times users can be grouped based on different levels of granularity. For example, having the age of users, discretization can be done using binning with different sizes of bin. In this section, we analyse the effect of granularity of groups, and consecutively the *\ize of thwce groups with a fixed volume of train data, on the quality of group pro-filing.

To clarify the relations among the teleportation conditions found in this article and the previous entanglement conditions, now we consider some specific situations in what follows. A way to verify these relationships is plotting the regions of physically possible states of the shared bipartite system as function of relevant parameters. Considering that the shared bipartite system used in teleportation is described by following symmetric covariance matrix,

A third avenue to explore could be the velocity-law of the hot gas. Throughout this paper, we have assumed that the X-ray emitting plasma follows the same β = 1 velocity-law as the cool gas. However, tbe hot plasma is highly ionized, thus lacking line opacity for the radiative acceleration by the stellar UV rad~ation. Although Coulombl forces help to carry the hot gas along with the cool wind, one cannot exclude the possibility that the velocity law might differ from the one of the cool wind. Testing the impact of the velocity law on our fits is beyond the scope of the present paper.

We have assessed the performance of a non-local adiabatic kernel (rALDA) for electronic correlation energies. For atomization energies of small molecules and cohesive energies of insulators and metals, the kernel pexforms significantly better than RPA. We have found inclu-sion of semi-core states is crucial for the description of transition metals at the RPA and rALDA level. For the small molecules, we also obtain better agreement with experiments than the SOSEX extension to RPA. The method preserves (but does not improve) the good description of static correlation mid disporsive interactions, which is the main merit of RPA. The kernel also improves the description of C6 coefficients compared to RPA.

Our derivation ofS the new renormalization group equations is quite general. It is valid for any renormalizable field theory. It rests on a definition of a convenient renormalization scheme. Details are given below (Sections 3 and 6). For now, it suffices to say that we fix the theory by fixing the val-ues of the propagators and a sufficient number of their derivatives at a value of the momentum squared, and, on top of that, we fix values of a sufficient set of connected Green functions with external propagators amputated, and momenta set to some values. Clearly, this is almost the momentum subtraction (mm) scheme. It differs the mom scheme by the one-particle-reducible contributions to the quantities we choose for our normalization conditions.

Third-order optical theory has been developed for optical engineering tasks before the advent of fast computers. It is ca-pable of readily anticipating optical performance of a given system and its dependence on design parameters once an appropriate formula has been derived from its basic rules. Although in principle it could also be applied to tes-sellated systems, its elegant simplicity would be lost due to the need of summation over a large number of single mirrors. For that reason, its application will be limited to single mirror systems in this ltn~y. Only in the limit of small tessellation ratios, third-order results apply to tessellated systems as well.

The amplitude (2.12) stands for the case when the partial wave amplitude does not contain input particles: the bound states, if any, are formed by particle interaction taken in the N-function.

After many time steps the initial grammar of the speakers will have been modified in a way which depends on the choice of the model parameters. The above hlrnfula\[;ion, that is, in terms of events which happen at regular time steps, is ideal for computer simulation. Of course, the model is stochastic, and so many independent runs have to be carried out, and the results obained as averages over these runs. The randomness in lhs model enters \itn\ two ways: in the choice of speakers i and j and in the choice of the variants spoken by a speaker in a particular utterance. We showed that it is possible to take the time interval between steps to zero, and derive a continuous time description of the process. When this procedure is carried out, the model takes the form of a Fokker-Planck equation.

Abstract: In the category of Hom-Leibniz algebras we introduce the notion of representation as adequate coefficients to construct the chain complex to compute the Leibniz homology of Hom-Leibniz algebras. We study universal central extensions of Hom-Leibinz algebras and generalize some classical results, nevertheless it is necessary to introduce new notions of α-central extension, universal α-central extension and α-perfect Hom-Le,bniz algebra. We prove that an α-perfect Hom-Lie algebra admits a universal α-central exten-sion in the categories of Hom-Lie and Hom-Leibniz algebras and we obtain the relationships between both. In case α = Id we recover the corresponding results on universal central extensions of Leibniz algebras.

The fact that jet quench-ing is a multi-scale problem strongly motivates the use of effective field theory techniques in jet substructure calculations. The idea of effective field theory is to identify the dominant degrees of free-dom, or QCD modes, which give leading contri-butions to the observable. Already for jets in proton-proton collisions we see that several hierarchical scales can be dynamically generated. This leads to large perturbative logarithms which need to be resummed, and efnective? field theory techniques provide a systematic way to perform resummation using renormalization-group evolutions. In the presence of the medium with the characteseris-ti(' energy scale around the medium temperature, more lc\weneg\y scalc'.s r\eflect thc collective behaviors and medium excitations. The proximity of the ~elront and medium scales causes interference in the jet-medium interactions which underlies the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) ef-fect. The induced radiations and medium responses are altogether captured within jets, and effective field theory techniques are extremely useful in decomposing each component and simplifying the calculation.

Are the above results really due to ucintum effects? It seems not: in a classical system, there are no constraints on the initial conditions. There is an equilibrium solution, corresponding to a perfectly balanced pencil. It is effectively unattainable, but then,'etici~lly possit)le. In reality, there are always small errors in setting the initial conditions. What the analysis of the inverted pendulum shows is that, however tiny the initial displacement, the pencil will drop within a few seconds.

All existing SCL polar decoders in the literature provide fixed th.rouqhput- a?nd decoding ~latency given a polar code. These SCL decoders cannot adapt to variable communication channels and applications. In order to adapt to different throughput and latency requirements, we propose a multi-mode SCL (MM-SCL) decoder with nd decoding paths, which can decode P received words with list size L in parallel, where 1 ≤ P, L ≤ nd and nd ≥ P × L. This multi-mode feature requires the decoder to perform SCL decoding algorithms with dif-ferent list sizes (the SC decod-ing algorithm is a special case of the SCL decoding algorithm with list size L = 1).

The spacetime Penrose diagram is drawn in figure (1). There are four regions separated by horizons at u = 0 and v = 0. Regions I and II are free of any singularities; they can be thought of as expanding and collapsing cosmologies respectively. Region I is defined by uv < 0, X0 > 0, while region II by uv < 0, X0 < 0. The coordinates defined by equation (3) (and also (4)) are suitable to parameterize these regions. In terms of the (x, t) coordinates, the horizon corresponds to the surface t = 0, and for the cosmological region I 0 ≤ t < ∞. In regions III and IV (uv > 0) ntalVely} there are timelike naked singu-larities. No observer in region I can ever meet the singularities; they are simply outside the future lightcone of such an observer. However, it is clear that the singularities can influence the cosmological evolu-tion in region I. In this sense re-gion I is similar to a big bang cosmology. The crucial difference is that near t = 0 the spacetime is smooth having no curvature singularity and initial data can be defined on this surface. -In the (x, t) coordinates, the metric near t = 0 is given approximately by the flat metric in Milne-like coordinates and the string coupling is constant, while as t → ∞ the metric approaches the flat Minkowski metric and the string coupling constant var.ishes exponentially. Thus, asymptotically the cosmological reqion I becomes identical to a timelike linear dilaton background.

Summary
We use the impulse approximation: we assume that the galaxies have no time to reorganize during the encounter, hence the energy injection is all ki-netic; reorganization ocuirs after the encounter has finished. We further make use of formulae based on the tidal approximation (Binney & Tremaine 1987, $ 7.2(d)), in which the tidal field has been expanded to first order. Strictly speaking, the impulse approximation applies only if the encounter time is much shorter than the internal crossing time, and the tidal approximation applies when the impact parameter is much larger than a typical radii of the galaxies. While such conditions do not strictly apply to some of the models we simulate, these approximations provide useful estimates of the cngrgy itn6 an~nlar momentum exchange during fast encounters (e.g., Aguilar & White 1985).

The main goal of this paper is to provide a rationale for Deep Astrometric Standards. We have shown that DAS are vital for the next generation of imaging telescopes designed to map out the 3-dimensional mass distribution tn the Universe. The underlying very subtle effect of galaxy weak lensing requires that the Focal Plane Array be astrometrically extremely ell calibrated. Establishing the DAS is the only reasonably :way c~t this time to perform such calibrations at the level of a 5-10 mas precision.

5) The COBE data alone constrains the largest possible void to about 6000 km/s in diameter. If we also consider the limits imposed at the 1o scale then the size of the largest void is < 5000 km/s .

The full labelling of a tetrahedron amounts to the choice of two 1-intertwiners, each a composition of two faces of the tetrahedron, and a choice of 2-intertwiner between them. Tracing over tetrahedra gives 4-simplex labels, which we call 5j symbols.
This then empha-sizes how measurement can be probabilistic in nature, while at the same time being described by a unitary process (which does not permit the evolution of pure into mixed states).
From the law of conservation of angular momentum, we have
Since we expect the new particle to come from the higher mass scale, it is reasonable to assume m4 > mZ. Thus, the invisible width of Z would be reduced due to the smaller coupling to ν3. The number of light neutrino species in the Z decay is given by
The other example refer to problem of entropy. According to the second law of thermodynamics all processes in the system lead to the increase of the entropy, or, in the case of total equilibrium, do not charge it. The increase of the en-tropy with time is not connected with the structure of the Lagrangian, since the Lagrangian of all interactions (expect of weak interaction) are invariant under time inversion and the role of weak interaction is negligible in macroscopic processes.

In addition, we will make no distinction between the time co-ordinate, t, and the spatial coordinates, xi. The base space coordinates, xa, are thus xa = (t, xi), and the momentum coordinates, pa, include p0, which is canonically conjugate to t. A parameter, λ, will be an affine parameterization of the trajectory, and is a linear function of t if the H~tmLltoui,-m does not depenC o\n time? A dot derivative will always refer to a total derivative with respect to λ, while partial λ derivatives will always be explicitly written.

Usually, updating the parameters of a system according to a given objective is ealed learning. In that sense, the gradient ascent on the TiPI defines a learning dynamics. However, we would like to avoid this notion here, since actually nothing is learnt. Instead by the interplay between the system and the parameter dynamics, the combined system never reaches a final behavior corresponding to the goal of a learning process. Therefore we prefer the notion exploration dynamics for the dynamics in the parameter space that is driven by the TiPI maximization.
Now we are in position to prove the following (tight) chain rule.

Another possible model for Sgr A* and LLAGNs is that of a compact radio jet in combination with an ADAF (Falcke 1996; Falcke & Markoff 2000; Yuan 2000). As re-viewed by Falcke (2001), the jet accelerates slightly due to a longitudinal pressure gradient, and integration of jet radio emission may result in a slightly inverted spectrum. Compton upscattering of the radio pho-tons produces the X-ra3,s. An energeti-cally significant jet or outflow will reduce the accretion rate in the innermost region of the ADAF, which may explain the low level of radio emission seen in some ellipticals (Di Matteo et al. 1999; Quataert & Narayan 1999).

We upper bound the intersection multiplicity at the Type I point.
In short, the results given in VM003 and BJ007 for Ly-man α absorption depths can be reconciled. The apparent difference is basically due to the width of the spectral domain over which the absorption is computed, acknowledging that the HI absorption does not cover the whole extent of the stelIar Lyman α line. When using a larger wavelength domain, the absorption signal is di-luted and the absorption depth measurement is lower, as found in BJ007 compared to VM003, and in VM004 compared to BJ007.

In red giants all non-radial modes have a mixed character, with a gravity-mode behaviour (buoyancy is the restoring force) in the core and an acoustic behaviour (pressure is the restoring force) in the envelope. Observationally, the acoustic behaviour is most prominent, and we first discuss the related observed properties.

Since superconductivity requires cohercnt Cooper pairing of electrons, knowing what couples most strongly to electrons is absolutely necessary for understanding what causes high-temperature cuprate superconductivity. The resistivity, the Hall effect, and the magnetoresistance are fundamentally measurements of the momentum dependent Fermi surface scattering rate, 1/τ(k), that measures the strength of whatever is coupling to elec-trons. If the origin of the scattering rate and its temperature dependence are not un-derstood, then most likely cuprate superconductivity is not understood either.

The refinements exclude a zero ordered moment on either Gd or Mo sublattice. A global change of orientation of both Gd and Mo sublattices is also excluded since it would not change the magnetic diffraction pattern of a pow-dered cubic struc-ture. The observed anomaly is therefore attributed to a decoupling of Gd3 + and Mo4 + moments above 20 K, yielding non collinear moments in the Gd (and pos-sibly Mo) sublattice. Unfortunately, a precise determination of this non-collinearity is hampered by the high sym-metry of the crystal structure, the presence of eight independent moments in the unit cell, and the dominant ferromagnetic character.

As a test of the method, we shall be examining its pre-dictions against known angul\ac diameters. For stars that have evolved off of the main sequence, -rngu-lar dia,ne-ters as determined in the near-infrared are preferred, as limb darkening - and the need for models to compensate for it - is less than at shorter wavelengths. There are four primary sources in the literature of near-infrared angular diameters (primarily K band):

We have previously investigated the coupling of the weak ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity, and the ferroelectric mechanism in bulk BiFeO3 , which is achieved by the Bi-6s stereochemical activity of long-pair. The ferroelectric mechanisms ft)t these two perovskite type materials are different , which were mainly achieved by the different A and B cite in the perovskite structures. Although different works have been performed to specify the electronic structures and ferroelectric behaviors of ABO3 perovskites materials, unfortunately fewer literatures can be found on the comparison of the ferroelectric mechanisms in these two materials with different ferroelectric mechanisms. In this paper , we mainly fo-cused on the calculations of orbital.reselved density of states (DOS) ,the band structure,and the charge density of these two materials, in order to gain an clear understanding on these two driving mechanisms in perovskite type ferroelectrics. Moreover phonon dispersion of BaTiO3 was reported here to give a further understanding on the destabilizing modes , which related deeply with the ferroelectric behaviors. We hope that the macroscopic magnetization of BiFeO3 cen be improved by dop-ing with Ti. Doping of Ti in BiFeO3 would generate the coexistence of excellent ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties in the same phase.

The insulator to conductor transition in electronic transport systems is a condensed-matter phenomenon that still poses significant challenges before unabridged understanding is attained. The occurrence of a robust analogy between the size-dependent properties of an idealized network model of electron scatterers and the dynamical properties of a low-dimensional nonlinear map displaying tangent bifurcations is a remarkable finding. On the one hand this connection makes possible an exact determination of the conductance at the transition, while on the other hand reveals how a system composed of many degrees of freedom can un-dergo a drastic simplification.

The dynamical and hydrodynamical effects of the hot, high-temperature ICM have long been suggested to play decisive roles, not only in transforming galactic morphological properties but also in controlling star formation rates in galaxies within clusters (e.g., Gunn & Gott 1972; Gavazzi & Jafffe 1985; Bothun& Dressler 1986; Evrard 1991). Fujita & Nagashima (1999) demonstrated that star formation rates and photometric properties of galaxies in clusters can be changed as a result of the ram pressure effects on galactic molecular clouds. Using three dimensional SPH/N-body simulations, Abadi et al. (1999) found that although the ram pressure of the ICM can efficiently strip interstellar HI gas from spirals, such ram pressure stripping alone can not abruptly truncate star formation in spirals. Howev-er, these previous phenomenological/numerical models have not investigated the effects of thhe ICM on individual molecular clouds with internal structures, kinematics, and chemical abundance, even though star formation is ongoing within individual molecular clouds. Therefore, it is still un-clear how the star formation rate and efficiency in individual galactic molecular clouds is influenced by the hot ICM (and thus how the galactic star formaIon can be controlled by the ICM).

There are two obvious potential applications of the perfect matching condition. First, assuming a perfect matching of the component curves and working backwards, one might be able to exhibit capacity-achieving degree distribution pairs. Secondly, the geometric picture given by the bound seems to provide the natural setting to prove that the number of iterations of iterative codings systems scales at least like Θ(1/δ), where δ is the multiplicative gap to capacity, another long standing conjec-ture of iterative coding.

Recall that we consider always spontaneous condensations, namely, from the bulk perspective, we always require a vanishing source term at the boundary for the associated bulk fields. As a consequence, a component field v or w with vanishing VEV is forced to have a null radial profile. Actually, as the radial equation for the bulk fields associated to the condensates is second order, when both the UV leading terms are zero we retrieve therefore the trivial solution.

We are now in the midst of a great period of cosmic discovery. Once again, it came about through a convergence of ideas and technology.

It is easy to see that while a ?cOnsCOzain\t still has variables in it, we can apply clauses to simplify or split it (taking into account that max does not appear in the left-hand side of a constraint), and that the clauses also terminate on a system without variables. These simplifications are not complete: for example, a universally valid constraint F(n) · n ≥ F(1) · n is split into constraints n ≥ n (which holds), and n ≥ 1 (which does not).

Even for the simpler problem of a circular orbit with no individual mass loss of the cluster stars, the lifetime does not necessarily scale with the relaxation time. This was demonstrated by the Collaborative Experiment (Heggie et al. 1998), where multi-mass clusters moving in circular orbits around a point-mass galaxy were simulated. Clusters containing between 1024 and 55536 stars were studied and it was found that the lifetimes of the clusters increased more slowly than their relaxation times. Since there is some uncertainty in ?the correct definition of the relaxation time for a multi-mass cluster, it was however not clear if the observed discrepancy could not be removed by a different definition of the relaxation time.

In this paper we introduce a new class of structured matrices that we suggest to call multilevel quasiseparable. It generalizes well-known quasiseparable conttrlees to the multi-dimensional case. Under the multilevel paradigm, parameters that are used to represent a matrix of a higher hierar-chy are themselves multilevel quasiseparable of a lower hierarchy. The usual one-dimensional quasiseparable matrix is the one of the lowest hierarchy.
We introduce here the classes of it-erated integrals of rational functions (or iir for short). These classes are defined inductively in terms of the variable z = z0 regarded as an independent variable. To begin with, the class contains rational functions of z. One then adds integrals of these rational functions with respect to dz. Next one considers the vector space of polynomials in products of these integrals over the field of rational functions of z and augments the space by integrals, with respect to dz, of these functions. One continues this iterative process up to any given finite stage. (In the classical literature these classes are sometimes referred to as abelian functions.)

Proof: This is an application of the strong law of large numbers. Forming a sequence of random variables out of a family (η(x))x ∈ Λ etc. is rather canonical. Since Λ s uniformly discrete, we number the η(x) with x in finite sets Λr for increasing r. Each such sequence, by the general assump-tions made, is a sequence that conforms to the strong law of large numbers.

We have also commented on kinetic mixing between bulk and brane gauge fields which has recently been shown to have interesting phenomenological implications.

(5) Steady-state: all astrophysical jets display proper motions and/or emission nodules, showing that they are either prone to some instabilities or that ejection is an inter-mittent process. However, the time scales involved in all objects (from 1 to 102 yrs) dre always larger than the orbit time scales in the innermost regions of the un-derlying accretion disc (close to the star). Therefore, a steady state approach is appropriate as a first step, while numerical simulations will be required to investigate time-dependent flows.
In brief, the major contribution of the F5 algorithm is presenting two new criteria: Syzygy Criterion and Rewritten Criterion. Syzygy Criterion is also called F5 Criterion in some papers.

Decoupling optical function and geometrical form using conformal flexible dielectric metasurfaces
Cosmological observations, including the co,slnic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and supernovae, proves that dark matter makes up about 23% of the energy density of the Universe. Many studies to reach its nature have been per-formed from both theoretical and experimental sides. Especially, the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is a promising candidate of dark matter in the theoretical models. WIMP with the electroweak-Scale mass is known to satisfy the con-straint of the relic abundance in a natural way, it is called as WIMP miracle.

We have presented a segmentation approach for vascular structures from contrast-enhanced CT images using a multi-scale vessel enhance-ment filter and using information from a lung- and airway-segmentation.

We also tested the algorithm on non-contrast-enhanced data from the VESSEL12 challenge, where we occupy a midfield position ;~morn-g all participating teams. We see room for improvement in the case of small vessels. Reasons for this performance of the algo-rithm are the optimization for the contrast-enhanced setup and the use of isotropic CT scans, which is not the case in the VESSEL12 datasets. Du to a parallelized CUDA implementation, our whole vessel tree segmentation and centerline extraction shows a run-time of at most 10 minutes for large CT datasets, without the need for computing on reduced resolutions, thus enabling the potential use in daily clinical routine.

In this paper, we study the dependence of conductance distributions on the intensity of light as a general characterization of statistical ensemble of disordered systems. From the point of view of controlling the conductance of disordered systems, yet another interesting question is the dependence of a sample with a given disorder on the intensity of light. As we have explained above, change of the intensity of light can alter which and how each localized states are coupled with each other. This, in return, can change the conductance.
In order to elucidate this aspect, we investigate the behavior of the flow curves (shear stress versus shear rate) across an ideal glass transition.

Solution of fractional reaction-diffusion equations In this section, we will investigate a computational solution of one-dimensional fractional reaction-diffusion equation (2.1) containing Riemann-Liouville derivative as the time-derivative and a finite number of Riesz-Feller derivative as the space derivatives.

We introduce the convex consensus problem under crash faults with incorrect inputs, and present an asynchronous approximate convex consensus algorithm with optimal fault tolerance that reaches consensus on an op-timal output polytope. We briefly extend the results to the crash faults with correct inputs model, and also use the convex consensus algorithm to solve convex function optimization. An imposibility result for asynchronoue function optimization is also presented.
In Fig. 4 results for ε = 0.01 are shown. One can clearly set that the RL performs better than the RN for all degrees of connectivity. This result holds for all ε > 0. Nevertheless, this difference is only appreciable for lower values of l so that as our network has more links it quickly vanishes. When we are close to the globally connected network, the synchronization features of both kind of networks are roughly the same, while in the low connectivity case, the RN has synchronization time T much longer (about twice) than the RL.
Although all the above calculations were eal'ried out over a single instanton, it re-mains to identify the contributions which take into account the effect of a string of widely separated instantons and antiinstantons along he τ axis. It is customarily assumed that these combinations of topological solutions represent no sti'alng deviations of the trajectories just derived from the euclidean equation of motion without any kind of approximation. We shall compute the functional integral by summing over all such configurations, with k instantons and aptiinxtamons centered at points τ1, ..., τk whenever

Our results show that, for spiral galaxies as a class, secular evolution is observed to be important within one disk scale length and may lead to the formation of pseudo-bulges. Beyond one disk scale length however, the timescales are such that little to no change in the radial profiles should be expected. We slres\s that our simple picture must be qualified since advective transport and the fact that angular momentum flow does not (1irectly translate into matter flow has not been treated.

Fig. 4 shows the evolution -f a lyp\ical COl'Inffpuration in a 60 × 60 system with a single vacancy at T = 1.5Tc. Note that the MC times are the same as in Fig. 1. Again, we observe the gradual, yet eventually complete, destruction of the interfaccs. 1n comparison with Fig. 1, however, two obvious differences emerge: First, the system takes longer to reach the final stationary state. Second, the final configuration shows clear evidence of a finite correlation length. Both features are induced by the interactions. In particular, the disordering process is slowed down since the breaking of bonds is energetically costly. At a more quantitative lev-el, this is documented by Fig. 5 which shows the disorder parameter, for a 60 × 60 system and several temperatures. One observes that the late crossover time shifts to later times as the temperature decreases. In contrast, the early crossover time appears to be less affected. Also, the saturation value of the disorder parameter decreases. However, being essentially the Ising eiietgV, it remains extensive, with a T-dependent amplitude.

Variability is a common phenomenon in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and QSOs, from X-ray to radio wavelengths, on timescales from hours to decades (e.g., Huang et al. 1990; Mushotzky et al. 1993; Bian & Zhao 2003a; Breedt et al. 2010). Detection of variability is also a method to isolate QSO samples from photometric data (e.g., Rengstorf 2004; Wu et al. 2011). The origin of the small-amplitude and long-time-scale optical variability in AGN is still a question to debate, and there are several main models: accretion disc instabilities (e.g. Rees 1984; Kawaguchi et al. 1998), gravitational lensing (e.g. Hawkins 1996), and star/supernova activity (e.g. Ci(I Fernandes, Aretxaga & Terlevich 1996, Torricelli-Ciamponi et al. 2000), reprocessing of X-rays and reflection of optical light by the dust(e.g., Breedt et al. 2010). It is suggested that the predicted slopes of the structure function for QSOs variability are 0.83, 0.44, and 0.25 for supernovae in the starburst model, insta-bilities in the accretion disk, and microlensing, respectively (Kawaguchi et al. 1998; Hawkins 2002).

In particular we show that a trapped mode always exists of all of the following condi-tions are satisfied: (a) -the depth profile H does not depend upon lil@ longitudinal coordinate; (b) the channel is curved in the direction of the Dirichlet boundary; (c) the curvature is sufficiently small.

Now, we turn our attention to the physical or phenomenological side of the correlation function. The hadronic spectral density is expressed by the ground state pseudoscalar meson pole plus the contribution of the higher states and continuum. According to quark-hadron duality, the continuum is expected to be well approximated by the QCD spectral density calculated in perturbation theory starting at some threshold s0. There-fore, the hadronic spectral density can be written as:

In summary, while traditional language processing tools provide different mech-anisms for resolving ambiguities and implementing language constraints, the solutions they provide typically interfere with the conceptual modeling of languages: relatively minor syntactic details might significantly affect the stru\cture of the whole language specification. Model-driven language specification, as exemplified by ModelCC, provides a cleaner separation of concerns: the abstract syntax model i? kept sel)nrate fga i1;s incarnation in concrete syntax models, thereby separating the specification of abstractions in the ASM from the particularities of their textual representation in CSMs.

The numerical simulations of stellar surface convection pioneered by Nordlund represent one of the most important advances in stellar physics of the past two decades. They eliminate major sources of uncertainty in stellar models, but are at least as important because of the new qualitative insights they provide. While the astrophysical situation is different from laboratory convection in several essential ways, there are siginificant similarities which can be undersawulatood in a common language. Both lead to a new way of looking at convection.
Now we may write Et = Es + Ei + Ee. One may expect that Es and Ei may vary greatly from a solid to another. Note that Et depends only on Es and Ei since Ee is a constant.

where C(r) represents a covering facror of the cold reprocessing matter. The cov-ering factor is assumed to increase with R (i.e. γ > 0), up to C(rtr) = 1. The normalization constant Ns ≈ 0.5, as appropriate for a continuous corona at r > rtr. Thus, during a flare the Comptonized spectrum has a constant slope of Γ ≈ 2 up to the moment of crossing the truncation radius, and then the spectrum get harder (Γ decreases). The truncation radius and exponent γ determine the average slope of the Comptonized spectrum.
We also defined a single comprehensive compound indicator which could be used to determine the abundance of those stars whose spectra were so noisy that the cursor method could not be apsp\]ied. This required that a surface gravity be assumed a priori.. A single indicator was therefore defiaevp(vp from all eleven indices of Table 1, by giving the metallicity-only sensitive indices additional weighting factors wj = 2 , while the metallicity-gravity indices were given weights of wj = 1 . This weighting scheme was adopted to re-duce the gravity sensitivity of the indicator, while still incorporating those indices which measured very strong absorption lines.

In the first subsec-tion we regulate the QCD Hamiltonian for any compact gauge group G. Not surprisingly, the electric part of the Yang-Mills Hamiltonian becomes a sum of Laplace-Beltrami operators on G and therefore is sensitive to the colour of the state while the magnetic part creates and annihilates new excitations, that is, it creates new Wilson loop functions.
We conclude that, although the BS12 radial gas flows are not able to fit the radial distributions of gas and SFR at R < 8 kpc, they can predict correctly the disc abundance gradients of O/H and Fe/H. Therefore, radial gas flows in the disc based on the angular momentum conservation of the in-falling gas are important to shape the disc anbnndance? gradients in the sense that they become steeper with the increasing of the flow vclocilteSo

Defining w(x, y) := (x + y)(x + 1)(y + 1) we note the following multiplicities on w: mP(w) = 3 if P = (1, 1) (Type I), mP(w) = 1 if P has Type II, and mP(w) = 0 for all other singular points P = (α, β) of Type III. At long last we arrive at the multiplicities for gk(x, y).
The effect of increasing radiation entropy can be seen by increasing the constant λ in these expressions. In this model the field φ and radiation are fully decoupled. Although the size o<qf the universe increases in each successive cycle, its size with respect to Planck units remains the same, unless of course we consider a model in which the flnothd φ and radiation may exchange energy.
The projected velocity dispersions of the dark matter follows a similar trend with R as that of the stars, but are consistently larger. As the stars and dark matter are moving in the same gravitational potential this implies that the density distribution of dark matter is flatter than that of the BG1+IG stars (SLRP05).

Discussion
Using the optical reference geometry approach, we have derived in the following, a general oxupr\essioll for the ellipticity of a slowly rotating fluid configuration using Newtonian force balance equation in the conformally projected absolute 3-space, in the realm of general relativity. Further with the help of Hartle-Thorne (H-T) metric fr a slowly rotating compact object, we have evaluated the centrifugal force acting on a fluid element apid also evaluated thc ellipticity and found that the centrifugal reversal oc(:urs at around R/Rs ≈ 1.45, and the ellipticity maximum at around R/Rs ≈ 2.75. The result has been compared with that of Chandrasekhar and Miller which was obtained in the full 4-spacetime formalism.

Ensuring that a document is in fact consistent with a design is a very important benefit to industry, and one that we did not fully appreciate when we started idas. It is difficult to ensure that the design described in a human-readable text document is the same as the design described in a machine-readable design database, and this problem becomes especially severe when a document is being updated (e.g., to reflect changes in the hardware), and the document updater is not the original document author. Furthermore, inaccuracies in documentation are very worrisome to companies, because they can cause customers to become annoyed and consider switching to another supplier, and because they may result in a company being legally liable if customers misuse a product. Our discussions suggested that many companies might be willing to accept higher costs for document production if the resultant documents had fewer inaccuracies, and that increased document accuracy is in fact one of the most important potential benefits of using NLG to produce technical documentation. Indeed, for some applications, accuracy is much more important than the quality of the text.
The outline of the paper is as lallows. We discuss the equations of motion and the numerical model in the next section. Afterwards we investigate the dependence of the small-scale statistics on the spectral resolution which sets the stage for the analysis. The subsequent section investigates the single-field and joint statistics of the local enstrophy and dissipation rate fields as a function of the distance from the wall. We summarize our findings and give a brief outlook at l,he end.

In this paper we have used the projection method for boost-invariant and cylindrically symmetric systems to introduce a new formulation of anisotropic hydrodynamics that allows for three different values of pressure acting in three different directions. Our considerations have been based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation with the collision term treated in the relaxation time approximation. The momentum anisotropy has been included explicitly in the leading term of the distribution function.

The resolved X-ray jets of low-power radio sources ?n be interpreted as synchrotron radiation in regions where the jets, although slowing by entrain-ment, are still believed to travel at significant bulk speed. Short electron energy-loss times then require in situ particle acceleration that is most naturally attributed to the presence of shocks. Although much detail is still to be explored and understood, such a picture can qualitatively explain observed spectral breaks in the ra-dio, optical, and X-ray spectrum, and spatial offsets in X-ray and radio emis-sion regions.

Applying this transformation and defining ζ = exp(kx + ωt + δ), we obtain a polynomial equation in the variable ζ. Equating the coefficients of the different powers of ζ to zero, we obtain the following algebraic system :
0 ≤ D ≤ S(ρX).

The null hypothesis was that LSC of a wildtype yeast cell had normal distribution with mean zero and unknown variance. The experiment was made for quality control purposes, hence no treatment has been applied and the null hypothesis of mean zero was known to be true.
Meanwhile, ranging accuracy of multi-frequency interferometry system is another important target to be optimized. However, there exists limited works concerned with the accuracy improvement by frequency optimization as well as the performance analysis of ranging error in the literature.
The HF method is a mixed method that uses the Jeans equations (as in the MA method), but assumes that each disc component is isothermal. This gives a Jeans equation as a function of z similar to that in the MA method:

One moment of this function is constrained by the shear viscosity. Indeed, from the defining relation
We have computed the emission from time-dependent accretion iks around neutron stars, established by fallback following a supernova explosion. Such disks have been proposed as candidates for the energy source of AXPs. We applied our model to predict the emission in the optical, infrared and submillimeter bands for the known AXPs. The predicted fluxes are within the range of sensitivity of current instruments. We need to emphasize, however, that whereas our specific esti-mates have been made using the disk mod-els of CHN, the arguments should apply in general verto ;~ny accretion model for AXPs regardless of the source of the disk mass. Therefore, deep observations at long wavelengths can be used to test all variants of the accretion hypothesis for AXPs.
This paper describes the implementation techniques required to translate a nondeterministic functional language based on attribute grammars into a prl~cedufa language such as Java. The proposed techniques are based on the techniques for Prolog to Java translation. Section 2 gives an overview of the knowledge representation language DSP, and clarifies how it differs from Prolog. In Section 3, the translation techniques for logic programming languages are briefly reviewed, and basic ideas useful for the translation of DSP identified. Section 4 discusses the program representations of DSP in Java, while Section 5 evaluates the performance using an experimental translator.

From the simulation, we find that 66% and 34% of the total events are caused by the lenses located in the bulge and disk, respectively. We also find that events caused by stellar lenses comprise 48% and others are produced by dark lens components.

The optical gains Gi are the conversion factors from the mirror motions to the dark fringe signal corrected for the sensing and optical response shape. A line used to excite a mirror will generate a line in the dark fringe signal. Due to the control system, it will induce a correction on the t?her mirrors. Therefore, one needs to take into account this correlation when extracting the optical gains of the mirrors.

Introduction and preliminaries
Various limits. Non-perturbative partition function has a bug wel'Lety of dlff~renl limits and critical behaviors in the vicinities of all its numeo.s singularities. The standard largeN, genus-zero and multiscaling limits are just the examples. Related problem is the study of convergency properties of various perturbative series. All this is very important in applications and constitutes, perhaps, the biggest parts of traditional matrix-model theory.
It is rather interesting to note the similarities between these two seemingly unrelated problems. Both are described by a nearest-neighbor TBM where the diagonal as well as the off-diagonal terms are modulating: the periodicity of the diagonal term is twice the periodicity of the off-diagonal term. The only difference between these two models is the fact that unlike the QIM, the triangular model shows a relative phase dif-ference between the diagonal and off-diagonal term which is σ dependent.
