At microwave frequencies where complex reflection and transmission measurements (S-parameter) are common, it is difficult to characterize bianisotropic materials. This difficulty stems from lhe f a c t that these materic~ls are necessarily described by the most general form of the constitutive relations. T h e r e may be 36 complex quantities to determine, and thus standard complex reflection and transmission measurements yield incomplete EMilfars)mata AtTHz and higher frequencies where phase sensitive measurements are not common it is even more difficult, although methods such as ellipsome-try or THz time domain spectroscopy may prove use-ful. Further since a magnetic and electric resonant response enter similarly into the Fresnel equations, it is dil-ficult to determine the origin of the response. Typically, artificial magnetic metamaterials are constructed fromconducting elements, and thus a full electromagnetic characterization is a necessity, since an electric response is unavoidable. Analytical theories haveyiislded equations able to predict the resonant frequency ω0and plasma frequency ωp of metamaterials. However there is a lack of suitable analytical methods capa-ble of determining the many varying and complicatedEM properties. Simulation is still heavily relied upon and, as of y e t , is still unable to determine and distinguishing bianisotropic response.

The critical end point itself may appear where the cross over from thequarkyonic and the deconfinement phase transitions intersect.

If we wish to generalise further, we need to develop the analogues of the uniqueness of the Jordan algebra. The proof we had in the separable case rested upon the uniqueness of the Cantor algebra. In the higher-dimensional case we cannot hope for that, but perhaps we can obtain uniqueness restricted to algebras that have the same dense set. This research brings us out of the scope of the present article and we plan it for the f u t u r e work.

In summary, an ultralow temperature point contact setup using nanopositioners was used to measure differential resistance ofW/SRO point contact junctions.We find: 1) a superconducting gap around 0.2 mV and a dome like shape of conductance enhancement, consistent with chiral p-wave symmetry; 2) SC-like features persistig u p to 6.2 K, much higher than the bulk Tc of SRO, presumably due to the pressure exerted by the W tip and a mechanism similar to that of the 3K-phase; 3) a broad resistance hump coexist-ing with superconductivity, which is ascribed to density of states effect due to 2D electron-electron interaction, consistent with the highly anisotropic electronic system of SRO. We believe PCS may provide useful information beyond the surface problem for SRO.
In conclusion, we have shown he the ZFC state is stable against current cycling in con-trast to the FC t a ?I?? ???e: lil w tr\ ]ch is found to be metastable.

Afteridentifying the plausible alignments to V- and J- genes, we turn tothe problem of identifying D-gene matches. This is a more difficult problem because the D-genes are short, and deletions (occurring on both ends) often leave residual sequences which are hard to identify as a D-gene fragment. We therefore put very loose con-stra int s on the D-gene alignments, relying on the probabilisticrefinement to narrow them down. Specifically, we consider the read sequence segment lying between the end of the highest-scoring V-gene and the end of the highest-scoring J-gene, ?ndinclode 0 nucleotides of flank-ing sequence on either side, to allow for ambiguous origin of these bases. We identify as a possible D-gene match every maximal non-verlappnc alignment to this segment of the three D-gene alleles. These D-gene matches are scored by their length and the top 200 are selected as possible D-gene alignments.

Two typ-ical sequencescan be identified in the abundances of the various clusters: d, t, h, α at low baryonic density and d, t, α,h at the higher total baryonic density at which clus-ters are still present. Deviations from this behavior are found for lower temperature (T = 3.5 MeV) or higher proton f raction (Ypg = 0.5). In general, the dominant contribution comes from the deuterons. At v ery l ow density,the sequence reflects the ordering in size: the smaller clusters are more abundant. The difference b,etvett t and h, and more precisely the finding that tritons are more abundant than helions, is due to two effects: globally there are more neutrons available and, llloreoveR, the triton is more bound. This last point explains why we find a difference among them also at Ypg = 0.5.

This fact strongly supports the correctness of the off-equilibrium approach forthe computation of the q = 0 component of the propagator (including the effectiveness of the extrapolation procedure) and confirms that it is possible to com-pute equilibrium expectation values in off-equilibrium simulations. Moreover the double peak structure of the correlation function probability distribution survives in the infinite volume limit since the dynamical expectation values have been computed on a very large lattice (infinite to all practical effects). It is remarkable that the distribution probability of C(x) becomes widerwith increasing x.

If for some linear function on a d-polytope with d + 3 vertices there is a monotone path through Mubt(d, d + 3) vertices, then the polytope is simple and dual-to-neighborly, and the linear f-ullc-tin induces a Hamilton HK AOF. So for our problem we have to enumerate Hamilton HK AOFs on the graphs of dual-to-neighborly d-polytopes with d + 3 facets, which are in fact dual-to-cyclic in the case of even dimension.

Blaschke (CNB-Madrid), under the umbrella of the ISCB BioLINK Special Interest Group for Text Data Mining (see http://www.pdg.cnb.uam.es/BioLINK/). We are planning two tasks; the first is the extraction of gene orprotein names from text, so that we can evaluate the currerit state of the art in biological entity extraction across systems that have been reported in the literature over the past few years. The second task wi3l require systems to associate Gene Ontology (GO) terms with mentions of proteins in arti-cles curated in theSWISS-PROT database. Our experience in organizing the KDD competition leads us to believe that by using data from curated databases and focusing on tasks of immediate utility both to database curators and to researchers, we can define a good challenge evaluation for text data mining systems.

A particular form for the function y(φ) motivated by particle physics considerations could now be chosen and an estimate for the energy scale at the end ofinflation deduced. However, given the enhanced ac-curacy of recent CMB measurements, it- is of more interest to consider what observations may revealabout the under-lying inflationary model. We therefore explore this possibility in the following ~ec?tion.

The next step to our approach is to examine each node in te rms of its possibility to be reached. Infeasible situations could be happened as thc bounding boxes of objects in the scene may not be able to perfectly fit these structures and they often have irregular non-convex shapes. In addition, it is possible someobstacles and stable structures such as mountains, to be inserted between the slingshot and the target. Therefore, an exam-ination step is required at each node so as to ensure that the corresponding ra\]ectOlls can reach the target.
Finally, we recall the IMBH model which has spectral support from some sources (Miller et al 2004; the level of absorption in NGC 1275 is too high for any soft excess to be observed). They may form in dense star clusters.

It has been suggested (Sorrel 1990) that carbon is i;ranmbfoPmcd into graphite in the ISM by an annealing process caused by the interstellar radiation field (ISRF). The SMC would, in that case, be a privileged site for gra t)hi te formation because the ISRF is greater there than in the Galaxy (Lequeux 1989). But that does not seem to be the case,sincethe UV bump is not generally observed.

This definition is a natural generalization of the Riemannian normal homogeneous space. Although in most cases the normal homogeneity is only referred to a compact coset spaceM = G/H o f acompact f,i.6e group ~, the theory can be applied to some special non-compact coset spaces with very minor tech ni ca l adjustment. Note that if G is a cnmp.act simple Lie group, then there exists a \nique bi-invariant Riemannian metric on G (up to homotheties). However, there usually exists infinitely many bi-invariant Finsler metrics on a compact Lie group (up to homotheties), even for a compact simple Lie group. This implies that normal homogeneous Finsler metrics are not related to the group G as closely as in the Riemannian case. Hence the problem of this paper is much more difficult than the same problem in the Riemannian case.
More-over, it is easily seen to be totally real and may be smoothed to C2 + α.

We use data from Open Street Maps (OSM) to identify p o s - s i b le r o u t es a n d locations of turns and we find the rotttre that best fits th e given speed data. OSM data is in the form of nodes that areassociated with different roads so a path will be a sequence of nodes. Each node has a physical location, given by a latitude and longitude, allowing us to determine distances between segments of roadand the turning angle of a path of nodes.
While it is certainly less restrictive to assume infinite precision for the average values of the coefficients rather than the coefficients themselves, it is still unclear whether this assumption on the average values could be s a t isfi ed. (The in-principle unsatisfiability of this, on the other hand, wold imply that we can never, a s a matter of fundamentals, get rid of systematic, as oppused to statistical, errors.) Note also that in order to apply the central limit theorem we need to have a fi-nite variance for the al-gorithm outputs. But, as the outputs (xi, yi) for randomly distributed inputs (ui, vi) may not be bounded from above, it is yet to be shown that the former could have a finite variance even if the latter does.

In this paper, we focused on approaches for cleaninginconsistent web data. We showe d that the current state of the art approachem, which learn and use conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) to rectify data, do not work well with web data asthey demand clean mas ter data for training. We proposed a fully probabilistic framework for cleaning data that involved lc: ~rn-ig t5e th the generative and error(corruption) models of the dataand using them to clean the data. For generative models, we learn Bayes networks from the data. For error models, we consider a maximum entropy l1r;tmc(>rle for combing multiple error processes. The generative and error models are learned directly from the noisy data. Preliminary experimental results on web data showed that our probab il i s t i c approach is able. to reduce errors in the data long af-ter CFD-basedmethods fail to be effective.

As previously mentioned, E obtains a small gain for each time-step an honest node is within the network, and a small loss for each time-step a malicious node remains in the network. Formally, we can write that the total gain G we obtain from some node i, which E re-moves at time N, andwhich would voluntarily leave at time H is:
Thus, the ambiguity in the choice of the hadronic continuum threshold and the parameter of the sum rule scheme essentially reduces the reliability of the QCD sum rule predictions for the leptonic constants of the vector and pseudoscalar Bc states.

Let P be a simple polygonin the plane, that is, a closed region bounded by a piece-wise lin-ear, simple cycle. A triangulation T of P is a geometric (straight-line) maximal outerplanar graph whose outer face is the complement of P and whose vertex set consists of the vertices of P. The edges of T that are n o t on the outer face are called diagonals. Let d be a diagonal whose removal creates a\ co nvex qu a d ri lat eralf. Replacing d with the other diagonal of f yields another triangulation of P. This operation is called a flip. The flip graph of P is the abstract graph whose vertices are the triangulations of P and in which two triangulations are ad-jacent if and only if they differ by a single flip. We study the flip distance, i.e., theminimum number offlips required to tran sform a given sourcetriangulation into ,, target triangulation.

Application to physical p r o blems involving material points
Soon after General Relativity (GR) was first introduced, several attempts to form alternative theories of gravity where made. Some of the most interesting were those based on an effort to build a more g eneral theory by dropping one or more of the several assumptions of GR, like the fact that the only degrees of freedom of t he gravitational field are those of the metric, or the simplicity choice that the gravitational Lagrangian shoul d be a linear function of the scalar curvature.
This study was made with two complementary approaches: CMD fitting and full spectrum fitting. The first method uses CMDs usually ob-tained with HST/AClar=>Ss while the last uses long slit spectra that can be acquired on a ground based telescope.The two methods are consistent and it is notable that the fullspectrum fitting can give finer constrains on the me t a l l i ci t y. I n full spectrum fitting, the metallic-ity is directly constrained by the metal absorption lines from the stars, while CMDs rely on broad bands colours and on stellar evolution models. It is the first time that a detailed spectroscopic determination of the SFH was successfully applied to low surfac e brightness galaxy (with low S/N data).
therefore, we can concentrate on C + (B). Our main result is stated as follows.

Our second argument in favor of our program has two parts: first we show that a necessary requirement for self-consistency of the renormalization program is that all of the internal p rpagators have t o be of the same form. Second we show that in theprocess of connecting the internal and external pl:opagators through the internal pointsimmediately adjacent to the external ones, the requirement of consistency mandates that all of the propagators have to be of the same form. Since the external propagators by definition have to be consistent wi th the non-perturbative conditions on the system, t\ conclude that all of the propagators and the resulting counter-terms have to be ippaf such form.

Next, we consider accretion disk effects in more realistic waveform models. EMRI GWs are highly relativistic, with velocities close tothe speed of light and sometimes skimming the SMBH horizon. As such, Newtonian waveform estimates for GW data analysis are inaccurate. Herewe investigate the relativistic correction to the EMRIdynamics using the extended one bodyframework, and make simple estimates on the imprint of accretion disk effects on the GW waveform. This analysis, however, continues to neglect relativistic corrections to accretion disk effects.

We als address the validity of using an effective theory. We find that for light DM masses (below a few hundred GeV), the itibo?vn derived us-ing an effective tileory may be accurate to about 10%. If the mediator is heavy, but below a couple TeV, the limit derived from effective theory is in r41o~. conservative, and the true limit is stronger. But, if the mediator is too light to decay to dark matter pairs the true limit is far weaker than the one derived from effective theory. In addition, we find that the effective theory breaks dowu at DMmasnscs that areheavy enough such that the DM production is kinematically suppressed by PDFs, and we must take into account the UV physics in these cases.

To recapitulate, we studied analtialiv and numerically the dynamics of the apparent reflection point at the overdense plasma surface. We have shown that the velocityof this point is a smooth function of time. However, the corresponding γ-factor has quasi-singularities or spikes when the surface velocity approaches the speed of light. These ultra-relativistic spikes are responsible for the high harlnonIc generation in the fo,rIn of an attosecond pulse train. We show that the attosecond pulse emission can be efficiently controlled by managing the laser polarization. This is done by adding a low intensity control pulse with perpendicular polarization and frequency slightly different from that of the driving pulse. This relativistic plasma control allows to gate a single attosecond pulse or a prescribed group inf attosecond pulses.
Missed det ec tion and false alarms are traded off by anarbitrary choice of threshold, as in any detection algorithm.
A tree node of an evolutionary network N = (V, E) is a nodc: of in-degree at most 1, and a hybrid node is a node of in-degree at least 2. A tree arc (hybridization arc ) is a path such that the start vertex is a tree node (hybrid node). As in tree, a node v ∈ V is a child of u ∈ V if (u, v) ∈ E, we also say in this case that u i s a parent of v, note that in this case a node can have more than one parent.
In deriving the above, we have used kinemat ic relations
The PDPs achieved by different ARQs are shown in Fig. 1. In general, a hig. c e,, EH rate is needed in o r d e r to meet a higher throughput requirement. Also, with a larger K, i.e., the maximum number of transmission attempts, the system has the po-tential to achieve a smaller P D P, b u t the throughput requirement become more difficult to satisfy. Besides, when the throughput constraint is met, ARQ without feedback and ARQ with adaptive feedback achieve the same performance under the optimal policies. This is because each packet uses all the transmissioa attempts to avoid packet drop, and t \]ld proposed ARQ protocol reduces to the ARQ w i t hout feedback. From this set of results, we can draw new design insights for communication sys-tems with EH receivers:

The cm'retll;ly \a\allahle (2dFGRS, SDSS) and next generation (e.g. B O SS) large galaxy redshift surveys in combination wiCh the analytical formalism presented in this paper, will a h e r lw us to estimate the values of the relevant cosmological parameters using void sta ti s t ic s, providing independent measurements. These, along with the estimations made by other methods will contribute to reduce their uncertainties. It is also worth to mention that in a forthcoming pa-per we will explore the dependence of the statistics of voids with σ8 and Γ, using the void statistics found in the 2dFGRS (Patiri et al., in prep.). All this makes the statistics of underdense regions a very promising tool to constrain cosmology not just with the current surveys but also to next generation high redshift surveys.

We consider the stability of filamentary molecular clouds against axisymmetric fragmentation into cores. By solving the linearized equations of MHD and self-gravity, m'e ec'termin(~ h,ow presua truncation and the individual magnetic field components affect the stability of our models. We find that pres sure tru n ca t ion has a stabilizing effect, whichresults from the de-creased mass per unit length of the filament. Both field components also stabilize clouds against gravitational fragmentation. However, we find that sufficiently strong toroidal fields may trigger MHD-driven instabilities.

We have investigated the brachistochrone problem forentangled states. This answers the question that we have raised in the beginning, namely, given an arbitrary product state and general non-local Hamiltonian, what is the minimum time for creating a desired entangled state? We have shown that the minimum time depends inversely on the spe ed o f the evolution of the quantum system This is independent of the particular entanglement measure and holds even for multiparticle entangled systems. We have shownthc~t ('.ortwo qubits the pres-ence of initial entanglement does help in minimising the waiting time. In particular, we find that if wc are given an option of starting from a product state and an entangled state, and wants to reach the maximally entangled state, then it is better to start from some already initial entangled state. Because, in the later case the time required is less. We have shown that the time average of e nt a n -gl e m e nt ra t e depends on the Schmidt rank and on the fluctuation in the non-local Hamiltonian. W e have also shown that in a bilocal rotating frame the entangling capabil-ity is also directly related to the speed of the evolution of the ezJtangled staes. This shows that the entangling capability of a non-local Hamiltonian is actually a geometric quantity. Furthermore, we have proved a composition law for the minimum time when )\]thfe system evolves under composite Hamiltonians. We hupi that these findings will be of interest in understanding the entanglemen t rate and entangling capabilities of non-local Hamiltonians and in real experimental situations. In future, it will be interesting to see if all these fi ndings ~lso lfo ld for qudits and multiparticle systems.

Our work is an addi-tion to the very limited literature on both pricing with negative network externalities and iterative pricing. The model captures many interesting settings in real-world marketing, and is usually much more challenging than the positive externality counterpart. The hardness result identifiescomplexitystatus of a fundamental p ric ing problem. The algorithms achieve satisfactory performances in general and several important special settings. An interesting direction for future research is to narrow the lower and up-perbounds on the approximability of the iterative pricing problem with negative externality. Obtaining more accurate estimations for the optimal pricing is a key to reduce the approximation ratios.

The immediate objection to Golden is the use of irrational numbers and the poesi?bility of computer error due to truncation. Using 64 bit long and 64 bit double in Java, Golden failed at F75, differing by 1 in the last digit from AC, which failed at F93 from overflow. Note that a double has fewer digits than a long of the same cutér b?itsie .eeprosent;~tolt, so part of this failure is a practical limitation due to the representation of reals in the computer. In Table 1,assuming no trun-cation error, the predicted maxi-mum with an effective mantissa of 53 bits is at n = 76, the actual maximum, including truncation error, is at n = 74. Assuming additional space, Golden works correctly for any n.

This procedure is perfectly well defined, even when rings e n te ~ and leavethrough the same faces of the cell (see also S.I.). We emphasise that this is taken to be a definition of threading. It isnecessarily a strictly local measure, on the scale of the cell volume. If the cell volume is increased no threadings will eventually be recorded since rings in the m\l?t are unlinked by construction.
Only the spheri-cal morphological type is studied here. We conclude that most probably there is a large population of spherical PNs, much n:oro .than non-spherical PNs, that are too faint to be detected. This leads to a new estimate regarding the distribution of PN progenitors and different PN morpholog y types (summarized in sections 1 \and 2). The new estimates compared with previous ones are summarizedin Table 1.

For simplicity in this exploratory re-search, we make the ap-proximation that the force constants coupling the substrate atoms are insensitive to the chemical species. Therefore, varying the superlattice composition is achieved simply by altering the mass matrix M. For real systems, the mass mo d ulatio n accounts for the majority of the effect, with composition-ally varying force constants contributing essentially no new physics.

In the present work, fe have investigated the impact that these specific real-izations of the interacting DE scenario have on the rotation curves of luminous spiral galaxies. More specifically, we have restricted our analysis to a particular class of coupled DE scenarios characterizedby a steep growth in time of the interaction strength, parametrized as a positive power of the cosmic scale factor. Such models have been shown to be in ful. a gree ment with present constraints on the background evolution of the Universe, as they do not feature the typical early DE scaling of other coupled DE s c e n a r i o s like e.g. models with a constant or a more slowly evolving coupling function. The background evolution of the models investigated in this work is in fact practically indistinguishable from the standard ΛCDM cosmology. Furthermore, the impact of these alternative cosmologies on the statistical properties of large scale structures is confined at very low redshifts, which makes it problematic to test the modelsvia e.g. weak lensing measurements.
We could have extended this symmetry breaking pattern to the case where we have tusuon sets of vector representations, φa1 and φa2. The uuse,'tynclall?t\ spin connection can depend on the length of each Lorentz ve c t o r and the angle between them, |φa1 | , |φa2 |, and |φa1φa2 |. The solutions for the minim um must be obtained from the conditions imposed on these three quantities. We can choose φa1C,A), with only the last component non-zero and φa2 with the last two components non-zero in order to satisfy these conditions. The Lorentz SO(3, 1) symmetry is then broken down to O(2) (or U(1)) symmetry44.

The plot of power against T y p e I error rate is sometimes known as tthc Receiver Operating Characteristic, or ROC, the name arising from its origin in radar. It is used a good deal in medicine (e.g. Zweig & Campbell 1993). A useful quantity could be the integral under the ROC curve, known as the AUC (Area Under the Curve). In our application, it is not difficult to show that the AUC is the proba bilitythat the evidence ratio, as-suming H1, exceeds the evidence ratio, assuming H0. This condenses the ROC into a single number, which for our examples is quite close to unity. This may be a useful compression in some cases, but it does lose the possibility Of ascribing weight to the de-gree by which the evidence ratios exceed each other.

Since the heart of this pathing problem is the lack of turn information one approach is to treat this as a classification problem. Here, we examine the speed traces to extract features: stop, right turn, left turn , or straight road. If classification would worg, well, we can assign probabilities to different choices at each inter-section and eventually find the highest probability path. However, road conditions and driving habits are very diverse. With our data set we were unable to classify turn features with high enough accuracy to build correct paths. The sheer volume of paths to explore meant that unless the correct p a t h was extremely different from all of the incorrect paths, the algorithm would find some incorrect paths that looked just asgood, or better, than thecorrect path.

A DAG model encodes conditional indepen-dence relationships via the notion ofd-separation. Sevsral DAGs could encode the same set of conditional independence relationships. These DAGs form an equivalence class, consisting of DAGs with the same skele-ton and v-structures. A complete partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG) uniquely describes such an equivalence class. In fact, di-rected edges in lhe CPDi),l are common to all DAGs in the equivalence class. Undir ectededg es in the CPDAG correspond to edges that are directedone way in some DAGs and another way i n other DAGs of the equivalence class. The absence of edges in the CPDAG means that all DAG m em ber s in the equivalence class have no corresponding edge. If all the conditional independence relationships of a distribution Pand no additional conditional independence relations, can beinferred from the graph, we say that the distribution P is faithful to the DAG G. More precisely, if P is faithful to the DAG G: for any triple of disjoint sets A, B and S in V,

Introduction and main result
In the literature there have been some attempts to use ifruite nbn-~Lbeeain groups te describe the family repetition structure. Usually, representations are considered to model the generations, and a complicated Higgs sector is constructed to ac-count for the observed mass differences between the fermions. In my opinion, this does not really solve th e mass problem but just s-hifts it to another level.It would be much more desirable to understand the fermion masses dynamically, in the model at hand, for example, by understanding the differences bet w e en the bindings of preons 1, 2, 3 and 4.

It is instructive to l ook at the way an eigenfunction at a given parameter value (α, β) is turned into the s e c o n d- n e xt hig h er st a te a f t er t he r ot a t i on a r o u n d the singularity. In Fig. IV, a n example of such wave-function morphology is displayed. One essential feature is the node change which oc-curs at the crossing of β = 0 line. On t~.~l line, the system is separated intothe non-communicating two subsystemsat x = 0 because of the infinite value of δ. The reason of noal chnnge is that the approach to β = 0 line from the β > 0 side and β < 0 side are physically distinct because they each cor-respond to δ = ±∞ and δ = ∓∞ respectively. (The composite signs are for the case of αγ0 > 1 and αγ0 < 1 r e s p e c t i v e l y , in turn.) Yet, at β = 0 line, two cases get connected smoothly.

Such segregation of ices is indicated by solid CO observations towards a sample of low-mass protostars show-ing evidencethat 60 % to 90 % of solid CO is in the form of pure CO-ice (Tielens et al. 1991, Boogert el; al. 2002, Pontopiddan et al. 2003). Likewise, observations of solid CO2 also provide evidence for separate ice components along the same line o f sight, although, in this case, this is generally attributed to the segregation of mixed H2O l CH3OH / CO2 ices upon warm up by a newly formedstar (Ehrenfreund et al. 1998; 1999; Gerakines, Moore & Hudson 2000; Boogert et al. 2000).

In thisletter we have examined the consequences of feedback from an early episode of SN explosions in proto-galaxies. An extension of the mechanism proposed by Dekel & Silk (1986), to higher velocity dispersion halos yields a modulation of the baryon fraction available for disk formation that depends on the depth of the potential well. This feedback applied to simple prescriptions for disk formation implies that the either the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher or the mass-to- light ratio is weakly dependent on the velocity dispersion of the halo.

The first solution procedure is a sequential one, where one first computes grid values of the cost function and then carry out the optimization procedure by employing the approximate values interpolated from the grid. It is important to note that all the grid values provide the design or ?ah?tl:xxro1? variables along wi t h the corresponding mechanical state variables of displacements and rotations which must satisfy the weak form of equilibrium equation. In other to ensure this requirement, for any grid value of design or control variables one also has to solve associated nonlinear problem in structural mechanics.

It is thus just as well that the only candidates we can see for quantities that might be calculable with arbitrary precision are the meta-observables, which extend beyond any one horizon. Since the horizon vol-ume (after a limited n um b e r of inflationary e-foldings) does not contain a living observer anywayany precisely calculable quantities associated with the interior of a horizon would be wasted.

In the quiet-Sun magnetic networks, cavities are important locations where the magnetic fields are sufficiently i nc lined due to their wcll evolved horizontal components. They are formed over the granular cells in form of the field-free regions due to the transport of plasma at their boundaries and overlaid by bipolar magnetic canopies. The ver\tical magnetic fields, however, reside mostly in the core of such magnetic networks (Schrijver & Title, 2003; Centeno et al., 2007). Such mag-netic cavity-canopy systemsare thought to be ideal resonators of the various MHD waves that can be trapped in t he ca vi ty, a s wellcan also leak in form of the magnetoacoustic-gravity waves upward through the core of such magnetic networks. It is thought that the f i e ld-free cavity regions underlying ( ; h ( > bipolar can opy can trap the high-frequencyacoustic oscillations, and the low-frequency components may leak into the higher atmosphere in form of magnetoacoustic-gravity waves (Kuridze et al., 2008; Srivastava et al., 2008; Srivas-tava, ZO10). un T het,e f0.rc, such magnetic structures in the lower solar atmosphere are the regions that may play an important role in the wave filtering (e.g. McIntosh & Judge, 2001; Krijger et al., 2001; McAteer et al., 2002; Vecchio et al., 2007, 2009; Srivastava, 2010, an d references there-in).

We first return to a point briefly mentioned earlier in the paper about a difference inthe UPB construction which appears when orthogonal UPBs are replaced by generalized UPBs. In the former case the PPT property follows directlyfrom the projection form of ρ, since this implies also ρP to be proportional to a projection, and therefore to be positive. With the use of a generalized UPB, we have no proof for this to be the case. Clearly the UPB construction will be simpler if we only have to take into account c o n d i t i o n s that apply to ρand not to both ρ and ρP, and for that reason we shall examine this point a bit further.
To reason about convergence of probabilistic processes, we will use the total variation distance on distributions (also known as statis-tical distance).

These calculations demonstrate that luminosity andtemperature of protostars not only depend on mass and age, but also on the accretion rate in the main accretion phase. There-fore, the posi-tion of a protostar on the HR diagram is sensitive to the cluster environment, because stochastic core interaction and competition strongly influence the ma~s accretion rate: PMS tracks are not unique, and mass (or similarly age) of individual protostars from using the HR diagram can only be determined in a statistical sense.
Nonminimal torsion-matter coupling extension of f(T) gravity
When fitting a simple modified black-body model to the data, we must keep in mind that there is a partial degeneracy betweenβ and Td and, more importantly, a per-fect degeneracy between Td and z. The peak of the SE D is determined by the ν/Td term in the exponential, so that a mea s urement o f the colours alone constrains only the ratio (1 + z)/Td. However, assuming reasonable priors on the free parameters of the ?ED model (in our case, β and Td) it is still possible to estimatea qualitative redshift distribution for our sample of sources. Alter-natively, if secure redshifts are known from optical cross-identifications, we can determine the dust temperatures.

Each element of the partition η consists of four poihts, and we label them with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 in a measurable way (so that the set of points with label i (i =1, 2, 3, 4) is measurable). For every point y, denote by n(y) the label of y. Define three involutions on four points v1, v2, v3 as follows: v1 = (1, 2)(3, 4), v2 = (1, 3)(2, 4), v3 = ( 1, 4 )( 2, 3 ). De no t e by pi = pi(y) the conditional measures of points in the element of the partition η that contains y. Using the combinatorial lemma given below, we introduce a polymorphism Φ as follows:

The paper is organized as f ol lo ws. The reEon d chap-ter introduces the variational formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation from which t he drift can be derived by minimization of a functional. The third chapter shows how a regularized empirical approximation of the functional leads to a nonparametric estimate. The fourth chapter presents examples of this estimator for the class of Langevin equations for which the extra conditions lead l,o only mild restrictions. The fifth chapter explains how the method can be extended to other types of noise, such as jump processes. We conclude with a discussion and possible extensions of the method in chapter six.

The extrac-tion of the above mentioned information from the experimental data suf-fers from several difficulties which arise due t o the complexity of the reaction mechanism. The ideal situationoccurs when the reaction mechanism can be explained with very simple models. In this article we use a simple andtractable model for the reaction mechanisms and apply it to the study of the scattering of unstable beams. Under some circumstances it is shown that our model can be very useful to extract the ground state properties of exotic nuclei. A study of this feature is presented in sections 3 and 4. A brief explanation of the calculation ground state densities for exotic nuclei is done in section 3. These densities are used as inputs in the calculation of the elas-tic cross sections, which are compared to some available experimental data in section4. To show the feasibility ofthe models used, we also compare the theoretical predictions with some experimentaldata for reactions with stable nuclei.

From the previous analysis wce have seen that the size of the clusters very likely plays a dominant role in the distribution of the different l)tt????????$?ff?????IL?orftsen as a function of the radius of the merged system. To shed light on this dependence, we present in this section a second set of simulations which are identical to the previous set presented before but for the radii of the tw o clusters, which we fix to 3 pc in the two clusters. We follow the structure of the first set of simulations and use different W0 parameters (W01 a nd W02): 3, 6, 9 and 12 for the two clusters. This gives 16 possible combinations and this time we perform two realisations per combination, which makes in total 32 simulations. We set all ot'bers,etup parameter (IMF,orbital parameters, age) identical to the first set, so as to be able to understand the role of the size andKing parameter more clearly.

Onthir high-resolution HIRES spec-tra demonstrate the weakly magnetic nature of N L TT 4 3 806 ( Figures 2-4). We used an analysis similar to that described in Section 3.2 of Farihi et al (2011b) and found a good fit to the line pro-files with a uniform B field of 70 kG (Setreamion )? This field is too weak to effect the determination of the atmospheric parameters derived by Giammichele et al. NLTT 43806 thus joins a few other known weakly magnetic white dwarfs that are polluted with heavy el-ements: G77-50, G165-7, LHS 2534, and c"TT 8381.

This could be a very important is-sue for thick-walled Q-balls, which necessitate φc < <φ0 so that we are already stretching the one-loop running to the limits of applicability.

This has not been attempted in the numerical simulations to date, however. Therefore, let us cc~nsider the consequences of assuming simple one-loop running holds over a large range of φ.

T h e tight empirical relationship between radio and far-IR luminosities for star-forming galaxies allows u s to take ad vant a ge of the wealth of data at far-IR/sub-mm wavelengths to derive the radio evolution properties. We expect a different eyo?luuon for starburst and normal late-type galaxies as t h e starburst activity is likely triggered by interactions and mergers that were more frequent in the past, while in normal galaxies the star-formation rate has probably not changed much over their lifetimes. The bulk of the sub-mm counts measured by SCUBA surveys (Scott et al. 2006; Coppin et al. 2006) is due to yet another population, the sub-mm galaxies (SMGs), interpreted as proto-spheroidal galaxies in the process of form-ing most of their stars ( G r a n a t o et al. 2004).

In particular, in any causal diamond in Minkowski spa ce there exists a sequence of uniformly accelerated trajectories that share the same past and futu:re tips. These are lines on time-like hyperbolaeof different curvature, but with different foci. In the limit as the proper time in the diamond goes to in-finity, they become the trajectories studied by Unruh,whichareflow lines of the vector field representing a Lorentz boost J0i. Simi-larly, in dS space, there are lines of fixed radius and fixed direction ni on the two sphere. Our proposal for the Hamiltonian for such trajectories in a diamond of proper time N is

What are the alternatives to the singular description of the translational motion of the D0-brane by means of o p e n strings? In analogy to the techniques used for field theory solitons, one can introduce the translational degree of freedom for the D0-brane explicitly (as a dynamical trajectory). The (singular) initial and final state massless open strings are then absent from the physical amplitudes by construction. Thisis the worldline formalism that will be our primary subject in the next section. As we shall see then,the amplitudes constructed within this framework are free o f in-frared pathologies.

We have presented optimized strategies to improve the efficiency of blind searches for isolated gamma-ray pulsars, whose search sensitivity is comp utati onally limited. Un der these conditions, our results confirm that ully coherent searches are generally less efficient than semicoherent searches, as well as that harmonic summing is typ-ically less efficient than searching only for the strongest individual harmonic. We also derived the parameters for most efficient search grids. As motivated by these results, we presented and studied the implementation of a multistage search strategy. We have also presented efficient computation and interpolation techniques for the semicoherent test statistic, offering further important sensitivity gains. Finally, we have conducted realistic simulations which demonstrate the improved performance from our combined advances, pro-viding Id a substantial increase in sensitivity (i.e. lowering the minimum de-tectable pulsed fraction by almost 50%) over previous methods at the same computational cost.

Whether the dissipation of vortex energy contributes significantly to cluster heating will, of c o urse, u lt imat ely dependon the energy released by the AGN. Even if the dissipation time is short compared to the travel time and the cooling time, a sufficient amount of energy has to be in-jected into waves andthen extracted into the vortex field, which depends on the filling factor of cavities in clusters and the on AGN energy output relative to the cooling rate.

A guiding principle underlying any effective theory aiming to describe the low-energy limit of a d e e per, m ore fundamental theory can be formulated in the following way: The low-energy (infrared) phenomena are not sensitive enough to resolve high-energy (ultraviolet) dynamics. It means that short-range (high-momentum) dynamics can be removed from the theory and replaced (renormalized) by a few local c o r r e c t i o n s . In momentum space one can therefore expand a short-range (SR) interaction as:
Finally, since θy ≥ 0 for all y, we have

The Yakindu models may in-clude state and transition actions. Since UPPAAL only supports transition actions, we also translated any necessary state action to a transition action. In Yakindu, the state ac-tions include entry, exit and timer based actions. The entry action should be performed once when entering the state. We translated this toan action assigned to all the incoming transitions to the crrespondiag state. The exit action, which must be ex-ecuted when existing the state, was translated to actions on all the outgoing transitions. For the timer-based state actions, we created a self-transition and used the timer as transition guard.

Here, we present the f i rst design and implementation of a microfabricated trap to perform individual addressing for optical transitions using a magnetic field gradient. Addressability is demonstrated by observing distinct peaks in the frequency spectrum, and by performing Rabi oscillations on one of two trapped ions with a low probability of unwanted excitation on the n c i n t i f y g h l ) ~ r i n g ion. Inte-grating the gradient-generating wires with microfabricated traps assures position stability. We evaluate this individual addressing scheme to s ho w that we can achieve reasonable gate speeds, a n d minimal crosstalk between neighbouring ions, with no decrease in coherence time measured with spin-echo. Finally we consider itsp~ospects for scaling to many ions.
For a perfect fluid at rest, e.g. a homogeneous scalar field, the Einstein equations can be written as
Panels (d), (e) and(f) show results for stronger helicity injection (η0 = 1) at which the h e l i c i ty is b e c o m \ [ ng a c t i v c. D e p e t / d i ng on α, t he e n e r s y accumulates in certain shells at large scales, i.e. in only four shells (panel d) or in all shells with kn: < 101 (panel f). In these ranges, the relative helicity tends to unity, which can be distinguished since H(k)/k (open circles) approaches E(k) (closed circles).
From these observations, we find that htlf?exle is a real se nse inwhi cht h e topological winding of the ground state is still encoded in the disordered system. Even though the disorder induces scattering and tends to randomize the internal configuration of the single-particle states, the correlation between momentumand internal degree of freedom persists throughout the topological state. This manifests itself consistently as a spectral flow of orbital entanglement modes as a function of the momentum entanglement cut. The topological phase transition toward the trivial state eventually occurs when the scattering is strong enough that entanglement modes saturate 1l2, which we have identified throughout this work as leading to thetrivialAnderson insulator. It would be interest-ing to see how these results can be applied to higher-dimensional topological systems. Inhigher dimensions the scattering kinematics are much less constrained and it is not clear how well the topological information would be encoded in the momentum entanglement. However, here we see that we can capture the correlations between the momentum and the internal degrees of freedom which is a fundamental feature of free-fermion topological phases, so perhaps this tool wi l \] st i ll ha u sef u l. I t may also be useful to consider this type ofhybrid cut for numerically identifying 1D interacting topological phases of fermions or even in spin-systems.

For an interpretation of these results it is important to distinguish be-tween the spectroscopic and intrinsic quadrupole moment of a particle. It isknown that a van-ishing spectroscopic quadrupole moment does not nec-essarily imply a spherically sy mtnetric charge distribution. For deformed spin 0 and spin 1/2 nuclei this has l'd to the general conept of an in-trinsic quadrupole moment, which can be cletfline. for different nuclear models. The notion o f an intrinsic quadrupole moment allows to interpret mea-surable quantities such as transition quadrupole moments in terms of the geometric shape of the ground state.

One way is like the following: To apply the Seiberg-Witten map associated with the noncommutativity in the rectangular coordinates we first transform the commutative solution obtained in the polar coordinates into the one in the rectangular coordinates. Then after getting noncommutative so-lutions by applyingthe Seiberg-Witten map with the canonical commutation re|at;on of the rectangu-lar coordinates, we re-write them back into the polar coordinates. The o t h er w a y is to use the Seiberg-Witten map directly in the polar coordinates without rewriting the solution back and forth between the po-lar and the rectangular coordinate sy~tems.

In this section we re view the S-matrices for scattering among the kinks and elementary (Majorana) fermions. From these we derive S-matrices for scattering between Dirac fermions, kinks and Dirac fermions, and rank 2 bound states and Dirac fermions. Knowledge of these S-matrices will allow us to compute the various form factors needed to ohtain tim results in the previous section. Before beginning it is necessary to lay out the group theory of SO(8). In p a rt icu l a r it is necessary to describe the spinor representations (i.e. the kinks) of SO(8).

From the viewpoint of mean field theory the graininess of the array should be unimportant. In this case one would expect to find a transverse conductivity similar to that of the Quantum Hall effect.

The paper is organized as follows. The QCD sum rules of three-point correlators are considered in Section 2, where the spectral densities are calculated in the bare quark-loop approximation and with account of the Coulomb corrections, and the gluon condensate term in the Borel transform scheme is presented. Nul'~tergumericnl estimates of semi\leptoniC decay modes are also given here. Section 3 is devoted to the NRQCD sum rules for re-coil close to zero. The spin symmetry re-lations are derived and the gluon condensate is taken into account in the s c h e m e of moments. The results are summa-rized in Section 4.Appendices A and B contain technical details in evaluation of decay widths fo the massive leptons and gluon condensate in full QCD, respectively.

The parameter α, which is proportional to the volume density of infalling material, becomes thekey parameter to be constrained hy the data. Its spatial variation α(R, z) is not known. However, experimenting with different patterns we found that the results are not qualitatively very different aslong as its value does not vary too steeply in the inner halo. We therefore take α to be constant, which implies that in a given interval δt a cloud captures the same amount of infalling gas regardless of itslocation. We exclude regions very close to the disc,|z | <0.2 kpc.

In § 3, we the present astrometric curves and the corresponding light curves of example binary-source events to illustrate the relative difficulty in describing the astrometric lensing behaviors by the blending approximation alone.In § 4, we statistically estimate the r a n g e of the binary source separation and the companion light fraction where the blend-ing approximation breaks down for the description of the photometric and as trometric lensing behaviors. We conclude with § 5.

It is also noteworthy that Bogdan et al. (2003), Fedun et al. (2009) and Fedun et al. (2011a) discussed in detail the excitation, propagation and conversion of magnetoacoustic waves in a realistic 3D MHD simulation. However, in these references, the waves driven by a periodic driver were discussed, whereas we numerically simulate the excitation of magnetoacoustic-gravity waves gen-erated by pulses in the gas pressure a nd v e rti c al co m po ne nt of velocity, mimicking an isolated solar granule. We aim to investigate and understand this simpler (albeit complex enough) system before tackling the more realistic, multiple granule system.

Since the CLAS has very good ;~(:prropeI)riuco for charged particles, anda very limited one for neutrals, the analysis of the γd → π0d reaction was based on detecting the final-state deuterons and selecting the good events by the missing-mass technique. Deuterons were identified from their time of flight and momentum, which allowed a mass reconstruction. Thus, the initial event selection was done based on the reconstructed mass. Further selection of events was achievedby comparing the event ver-tex time with the photon vertex time as measured by the tagger. Low-momentum protons were discarded based on a cut on the particle momentum vs. energy loss i n the TOF. In addition, fiducial cuts were applied to the re -main i ng data sample in order to remove edge areas of the de t ec t or where t h e acceptance was not well reproduced by a simulation.

A crucial note is due. The edge spin polarization in ballistic systems appearsnot as a result of electric field-drivenacceleration of electrons and associated with it precession of spins. Indeed, electric fiel,:l n a ballistic system is absent as the electric potential drop occurs over a contact region with the leads rather than over a bulk of a ballistic conductor. Nevertheless, spin precession does occur. It originates from accelerated electron motion in the boundary potential that provides lateral confinement. Bias applied to the contacts ensures t h at p o p u l a t i o n s of left- and right-moving states are different and the net spin precession appears. Naturally, itis proportional to the applied bias V. The net spin accumulation near an edge of a 2DEG is independent of the shape of the boundary potential,

It thus allows us to study the axion decay constantaroundthe special points of moduli space.

Conclusi?
In this article, we describe the mathematical str u c-ture underlying the integrable quantum pairing problem, and its relations with the theory of isomonodromic deformations of differential equa-tions and other integrable models of strongly interacting particles. We also explain the classical limit of the quantum hamiltonian, and give the explicit construction of the solution in this case. Possible applications due to the ipt~gus;abIl'(;<;'.y of .tb(: moel are listed in the con-clusion of the article.

We have proposed a novel method for the identification of nonlinear systems. This method is based on a lifting technique which recasts nonlinear sys-tem identification as the identification of the linear Koopman operator in an infinite-dimensional lslfacc of observables. A key advantage of the method is that it relies only on linear techniques. Also, it is ro-b ust to noise, well-suited to model low sampling rate data sets, and efficient to recover the vector field of different classes of sys-tems.

The method ofthe epicyclic appronimation(Lindblad 1927, 1959) allows the orbits of stars to be constructed in a coordinate system rotating around the Galactic center in a circular orbit.We assume that the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the local standard of rest and that the stars move along epicycles in the direction opposite to the Galactic rotation. We use the method in a form asociat d with a rectangular coordinate system (Fuchs et al. 2006):

Different approaches to the fermion mass problem are reviewed. We illustrate these approaches by summarizing re-cent developmentsin models of quark and lepton mass matrices. Dynamical calcu-lations of the top quark mass are discussed, based on (a) infrared quasi-fixed points of the renormalisation group equations, and (b) the multiple point criticality principle in the pure Standard Model. We also consider Yukawa unification and mass matrix texture. Models with approximately conserved gauged chiral flavour charges beyond the Standard Mo~el are shown to nat ura l l y give a fermion mass hierarchy.

Adding the four results does not yield the de-sired answer, since thc contribution of each of the two axes has been included twice, and that of the origin altogether four times. This c an b e easily corrected by subtracting F2(λ2, λ3; S) which removes the extra c o ntribution of the j1= 0 axis,and F2(λ1, λ3; S) which does the same thing withthe j2 = 0 terms. This leaves us with the origin (j1 = j2 = 0) which, at this point, is st/lH contributing double its value (two cuntribgtions have been removed with the two axes); subtracting λS3 fixesthat as well.

The remaining sources are most likely associated with EROs in their error circles.

We do not know of aspectroscopic identification for this source.

Engineering strong p-wave interactions between fermions is one of the challenges in modern quantumphysics. Such interactions are r e s po n s ib l e for a plethora of fascinating quantum phenomoe\na uch as topological quantum liquids and exotic superconductors. In this letter we propose to combine recent developments of nanoplasmonics with the progrcss in realizing laser-induced gaugefields. Nanoplas-monics allows for strong confinement leading to a geometric resonance in the atom-atom scattering. In com-bination with the laser-coupling of the atomic states, this is shown to resul t in the desired interaction. We illustrate how this scheme can be used for the stabilization of strongly correlated fractional quantum Hall states in ultracold fermionic gases.

ArgoNeuT proposed also to study a subsample of two proton events by demanding that both protons have momenta larger than argon Fermi momentum. In this way, they received a reduced sample of only 19 events. In NuWro simulations, the similar requirement reduces the number of events by a factor of 30%, in v(: ry good agreement with11/30 in the ArgoNeuT study.

Because our ansatz is explicitly time-independent, the Lorentzian and Euclidean solutions are trivially related.
The treatment of the entire basis set within one single energy panel allows all states, including the semi-core states, to h U e S b ri d a iz e fully with each other. Our methodis linear, i.e., the basis functions are constructed by expanding around fixed ener-gies Eν. The expressions for the crystal wave functions in the muffin-tin spheres are matched to the interstitial crystal wave function at the sphere boundaries so that the to-tal crystal wave function becomes continuous and differentiable i l l all space. In the present calculation, the expansion in spherical harmonics was taken up to l = 6. For Ce, the 6s, 5p, 6p, 5d, and 4f orbitals were included in the basis set, with 5p as semi core. For Fe, we included t he 4s, 4p and 3d orbitals, i.e., no semi-core state was used for Fe . Four κ2-values were used in the calculation: -0.6 Ry and -0.1 Ry for the valence states, and -1.5 Ry and -1.0 Ry for the semi-core Ce 5p states, all with re-spect to the muffin-tin zero.

Let us first consider a system with only two states, A and B. Unless there is at least one transition (say, from A to B), the system is trivial and does not evolve at all. However, with only A → B the steady state of the system is ρ(A) = 0 and the gener-alized entropy φ is not well defined. We therefore need consider eoy systems that include both transitions, A → B and B → A. Such systems, howev-er, have an equilibrium state that obeys detailed balance, and therefore the Crooks relation is satisfied for all(relevant)two-stat e systems.
6. At high energy densities a deviation of the UrQMD equilibrium state from SM results is found. It is connected with a specific behaviourof string d~gre\]a:desf freedom in the UrQMD model. This energy density region lies close (or even above) to the expected phase transition bound-ary ol'. the quark-gluon plasma state. The study ofthis energy density region deserves further efforts.
In Sect. VI we estimate persistent currents in the rings made of real band insulators (GaAs, Ge, InAs) with a fully filled valence band and empty conduction band. The current at full filling decays with the ring length exponentially due to the exponential decay of the Wannier function tails. In spite of that, it can be of measurable size.
T W o effects shouldbe considered here. First, if most PNs are formed from more massive than t h e Sun stars, which on average are more metal rich, then the percentage of progenitors interacting with planet increases. Second, as note by Soker (2001b), most known Sun-like stars that h a v e planets around them will not form PNs at all. Their plan-et(s) will deposit enough orbital angular momentum and energy to cause most, or even all, of the envelope of these stars to be lost already on the red giant branch. These starswill not evolve along the AGB, or evolved only along the early AGB. In any case, they will have too low mass envelope to form a detectable PN.

We briefly summarize theoretical methods for carrying out QCD calculations to next-to-leading order in perturbation theory.

One may perhaps object that the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy produced by the growth of a black hole is not actually produced (or at least not m ade acce ss ible ) until the black holes decay by way of Hawking radiation. The larger the mass of the black hole, the longer this takes, and certainly for the black holes at the centers of galaxies this time scale is considerably longer than the age of the universe. This claim would seem to fly in the face of the usual connection between black-hole area and entro p y required by the second la w of thermodynamics. Nonetheless, even that will not prevent black holes frombeing the primary source of entropy in the universe.
Homology and Cohomology
The analysis differs from previous point source searches most drastically in two points.
The central idea underpinning our dynamic a l approach is the following: Considering a diffusion process on a network, we ask ourselves what this simplest form of dynamics can reveal about the underlying community structure of the graph. This idea is readily illustrated by the example of a vessel filled with water in which one were to put a small droplet of ink and observe how it diffuses. If the container hasno structure, the dye would dif-fuse isotropically. If the container is structured ?e.g., compartmentalised or comprising a set of smaller vessels con-nected via some tubing), the dye would not spread i so trop ically but would rather get transiently trapped in certain regions for longer times until it eventually becomes evenly distributed throughout the whole vessel. Therefore by observing the time dynamics of this diffusion process we can gain valuable i n f o r m a t i o n about the structural otgaisation of the container.

where the density k(x, y) of sensors follows a uniform disribution in the occu-pied area by each cluster that is approximately 4a1/k. EucalR non-CH node only needs to t ran s m it its data to the CH once during a frame. Presumably the distance to the CH is small, so the energy consumption follows the Friss free-space model (d2 power loss). Thus the expected distance between a sensor and a CH in a cluster decreases as increasing of number of sensors in a bounded region.

The binary oper-ations that appear in these latter equations are very interesting objects, and in some f\eupsity? can be interpreted asa natural generalization of the usual Poisson Bracket. The standard Pois-son Bracket operates over functions defined in the same space, the phase space of coordinates qi, pi. Nevertheless, the binary opera-tors in equations (29) and (30) are connecting functions that live in different spaces. In general, if we have two functions f(xi, yi), g(zi, wi) that take values in different spaces characterized by the coordinates: xi, yi and zi, wi, it will be possible to define a Generalized Poisson Bracket that mi x es the flmctions and their variables

Moreover, the resolvent of A is compact in the energy space H.
Now we show that non-elementary subgroups have finite centralizers. Indeed, if the centralizer CG(H) of H in G contains an infinite order element c, then H fixes the limit se\t of the cyclic subgroup generated by c, so H cannot be non-elementary. Thus CG(H) must be a torsion group, in particular, CG(H) is elementary, else CG(H) would have to contain a non-abelian free subgroup. If CG(H) is infinite, it has a nonempty limit set that must be fixed by H, contradicting the assumption that H is non-elementary.
In the present paper, matrix elements of a two-body interaction between states of jn configurations were considered. The two-body interaction is taken to be a perturbation and hence, only the sub-matrix of the Hamiltonian, defined by states of the jn configuration, is considered. Thematrix elements are functions of two-body energies V(J) = <j2JM | V | j2JM> There are states whose expectation values (diagonal matrix elements) are linear combinations of the V(J) with positive rational coefficients. In this paper, it was shown that this is always the case for states which are the on ly one s with given J in the jn configuration considered. Such states are eigenstates of the sub-matrix considered.

We first deal with the p r o blem of e xt r a c t i n bubs and functional modules. Most previous approaches have looked at the problem of detecting functional modules separately from that of hndoff,ub pFotelns. HoQevyr, hub proteins form the key constituents of most functional modules. In any functional module, the hub proteins not only hold the other proteins within that module together, but also determine the most dominant functions of that module. Also, protein networks are usuallyvery sparse withseveral singleton(isolated) and loosely-connected proteins. Such proteins may be connected to one or more hub or non-hub proteins, but generally do not take part in any funct ional module. Taking such proteins into consideration induces false positives, thereby affecting the specificity of the results. Asa result of these observations, we approach the whole problem in the following three steps:

A second class of states is given by those which are asymptotically ?τ-statiouary in the eternal frame, but distinct from thetrivial CFT vacuum on dS. The natural way of engineering such tmtes is to deform the CFT by a relevant operator and consider stationary- states looking like condensates induced by the new relevant interactions. These states, w h i l e completely regu-lar in the eternaldS frame, are singular in the E - f r a m e and therefore called crunch states.

Specifically, in § 2 we discuss the retrieval of the Spitzer data used in our study and their photometry. General description of the mid-infrared characteristics of the region is given in § 3, and in § 4 the p o i n t sources detected with our photometry, and the selection of candidate YSOs are presented. The recent release of high-resolution data on NGC 602/N 90 obtained with ?th Advanced Camera for Surveys on Hubble Space Telescope allowed us a detailed photometric study of the stellar association and its surroundings down to the faint red pre-main masequelle btals of thesystem (Schmalzl et al. 2007). In § 4wealsocombinetheresultsfrombothHubble and Spitzer photometries to identify the optical counterparts of the candidate YSOs found in the region. Based on our findings we discuss the current star forming process that probably took place in the re-gion of NGC 602/N 90 with emphasis to the clustered behavior of st(ar formation in § 5.

We find that our results are qualitatively in accordance with numeric al simulations indicating that if vortices are forced to oscillate with amplitudes larger than the typical VL parameter, plastic motion introduces topolog-ical defects and reduces mobility. For smaller drives, vortices perform small excursions interacting repeatedly with neighbors and as the lattice becomes successively more ordered, its mobility increases.

Thus, we have a very clear one to one map between giant graviton configurations and vacua of the auxiliary gauge theory o n the D0 branes.

2. Shower Finding: Taking candidate tracks as input, an EM shower finding algorithm is used to identify the muons with possible EM shower dE/dx information. Muons deposit energy as a minimum ionization particle (MIP) in the \d e tecto c e l l s . The additional EM shower hits can deposit much more energy in a small de-tector region and overlaps with muon energy. It is then possible to take the energy deposition of reconstructed cosmic tracks and look forthe region where the energy is significantly greater than a MIP. More specifically, If we encind 5 consecutive planes with energy greater than 2 MIP, call it the shower start point; If we find 5 consecutive plane with energy in the range of 0.5 MIP to 1.5 M I P , c~.l it the shower end point; If we find both the shower start and end point, then theshower is identified as Brem; If we find only the shower start point, and reach the end of track without an end point, the shower is identified as an electron from D iF . Showers with energy deposition passing theenergy cut are saved as raw digit objects.

So if parts of the code that are less optimal for the GPU a re a l s o ported, not only will single node performance be better, but the code should also scale much better. While the above numbers arky somewhat arbitrary, they illustrate the general trend.

When radiation reaches the outflow region, which is still wIthiNthde electron s c at t e r i u g photosphere, the photons advect outwards with the outflow. Because the velocity of the outflow is so large (>0.1c), radiative diffusion is still not the dominant cooling mechanism in this region.

In the previous section we have seen how the different colour structure of the various processes leads to different weightings of the antennae contributions. In this section we study the implications of this for the actual gluon distribution. Our purpose is not to give a comprehensive treatment of all the possibilities, but rather to consider some simple configurations which illustrate the underlying physics.

It therefore appears that incorporating fermions on the 3-brane will require deriving the vierbein induced from the bulk d-bein and the 3-brane embedding. Indeed this is generally the case, and, as will be seen below, the result is considerably more complicated than for the induced metric, eq. (5). However, before embarking on this exercise it is enlightening to see why we cannot generally get away with a simpler approach.

Unfortunately, this approach does very poorly i?n the low-statistics realm. We consider a simple test case: Suppose our data is sampled from a flat distribution with a mean of1 count in each of 100 bins. We test how well our estimated nn?ll hypothesis works for any given test statistic,T, as follows:
where Ap refers to the alternated group.
We have also looked at whether the future measurements of lepton number violation and non-unitarity of neutrinoflavor mixing at low energies are possible to shed light on the masses of heavy Majorana neutrinos. Taking the minimal type-I seesaw scenario for example, we ha?ve illustrated the possibility of determining or constraining two heavy Majorana neutrInwledgmeo masses by using more accurate low-energy dan\ on the 0νββ decay and non-unitary ne utrino mixing and CP violation. Such an analysis can simply be extended to the more general cases of the type-I seesaw mechanism with three or more heavy Majorana neutrinos.

We have measured the topology (genus) of the luarge -rammarscale structure in the universe as observed in the Las Campanas Redshift Survey. We have found the genus of the den-sityfluctuations in the \]lnear regime to be consistent with Gaussian random phase fluctuations, as predicted by Inflation. In combinationw ith the the topology measurements of microwave background as observed by COBE, there are now two orthogonal projections of the three-dimensional linear-regime density f\luctuscatiet~ distribution. Both projections show the fluctuations are consistent with a Gaussian random phase distribution, within t he uncertainty.
Due to the limitation of our computational power, we have not been able to compute the minimum weights of the 840 ternary cyclic codes of l e ng th 1 43 and dimension 72.

The presence of noise in the data considerably affectsthe status of the inverse Ising problem. -As we will see later, even well-conditioned pr oblem(s i n the limit of perfect sampling (B → ∞) be-come ill-conditioned as soon as sampling is imperfect (finite B). The same statement holds for the s p a p \ s i t y - b ~ s ' e d cr iterion mentioned above: when data are generated by a sparse interaction network, the solution to the inverse Ising model is not sparse as a consequence of im-perfect fmnf?p.le?.t Only the presence of an explicit and additional regularization forces the solu-tion to be sparse. In much the same way, the procedure we present hereafter builds a well-con{litimoned inverse Ising problem, which prevents overfitting of the noise. This \ptoCetdur@ is based on the ex-pansion of the entropy at fixed frequencies in clusters of spins, a notion closely related to the neighborhoods appearing in the localized responses.

For the pre-cise measurements of inter-satellite distances in these orbit configurations the general relativistic effects must bc\ investigated and their impact on observables taken into account for a given accuracy level. In this work we will focus on such orbital configurations and refer to one satellite as the reference object moving on the reference geodesic. The orbit of the second satellite will then be modeled by means of the geodesic deviation equation that de-scribes how nearby geodesics deviate from each other due to the geometry of spacetime and given initial conditions. We will first describe thesituation in stan-dard Newtonian gravity and then turn to the full theory of GR to uncover relativistic modifications.

Notethat for y > 1, the pseudo-moduli space is unstable for all X, while for y < 1 there is some neighborhood around X = 0 which is stable. The size of this neighborhood grows monotonically as y → 0.
One virtue of this observation is that it helps explain away the gap between the many hundreds or thousands of fields of a typical string compactification (especially, the oneh with enough vacua to solve the c.c. problem) and the smaller untber in the StandardModel, as symmetry breaking will get rid of nonabelian gauge groups and generally lift fi-eld. But it is very different from the usual particle physics intuition.
Here, nc(m, δl) is the conditional mass function within a region with linear den-sity fluctuation δl.

The e?xper?imentally most relevant lattice is the fcc. The application of this theory to a synthetic fcc opal structure shows that the diffusion coefficient is linear with the mean free path of the carriers. This result holds up to mean free paths of the order of 15% the diameter of the spheres. The effect of the opal structure is to reduce the effective speed of the carriers. We calculate the dependence of this effective velocity with the size of t h e spheres.

In this article, we follow a different route based on an underlying theory and demonstrate that this sce-nario indeed has great pot enti alit y in addressing the issue of acceleration of the universe in different era from a common platform. The reader may consider it as an altogether new paradigm rather than the continuation of an old idea. We derive the form of the cosmological term from this theory, which rules out any ad-hoc behavior. This eventually answers to the question of energy exchange too. The dramatic consequence of this idea is that it reflects all the characteristics of the expansion his-tory of the universe of all era by a single entity anddemonstrates a transition from inflationaryphase tolate accelerating phase through radiation-dominated and matter-dominated era. We also show that ΛCDM falls as a subset of this framework, whichleads to further observational consequences.

In summary, we have introduced and tested a novel algorithm to simulate the stochastic dynamics of discrete variable mod-els.

It may be that the most stable and accurate filter set for SN Ia cosmology could be built from a combination of glass and interference filters or possibly hybrid glass / interference fil-ters wher?eFeaM gl-al'ss provides the lw wavelength cut-on and a small number of interference filter layers profides the cut-off. The novel idea of using high pass filters with tuned cut-on points and then subtracting them post-observation to create a narrower filter may also be worth considering. However, this procedure increases the measurement error. Unless glass filters are developedin the infra-red the NIR filters need to be interference filters.

We investigated the effect of or-der direction, order aggressiveness and investor type on the dynamics of order flows. In each case, we found an increase of order volume followed by a slow decrease, which forms a peak around the extreme events. The volume peak of buyer initiated execution orders was found to appear earlier and higher than seller initiated executed orders around positive events, while the volume peak of seller initiated execution orders was found to lead buy er initiated execution orders in the magnitude and time around negative events. When orders are divided into four groups according to t h e i r aggressiveness, the behaviors of partially filled market orders, filled market orders and canceled orders are qualitatively thesame: T h e volume peak of buy (sell) orders of each type appears earlier and higher than sell (buy) orders around positive (negative) events. However, l ;he volume peak ofsell (buy) limit orders shows up eArlier and higher than buy (sell) orders around positive (negative) events. No qualitative dif-ference has been observed in the volume dynamics around extreme events between individuals and institutions.

The argumentslaid out in this s e c t i o n are for the required infall mass of the LMC. The s ubs eq ue nt mass loss incurred by the LMC as i t orbits about the MW will necessarily causesigni ficant modifications in the orbits presented in the following section. A proper analysis accounting for this effect requires detailed N-body simulations that, in principle, are beyond the scope of the simple backward integration scheme presented here. Nonetheless, to validateour assumptions, we will compare the results from oneof the MW+LMC mass combinations with those obtained with the corresponding fully self-consistent N-body model.

From Theorems 1 and 2, we may immediately deduce the asymptotic convergence order of QIs for polynomials.
In the trivial patterns the rotation centers of order 4 can only be in the vertices, and the ro-tation centers of order 2 can only be in the vertices or in the center of the edges; these are thetrivial centers.
Now it isclear that the problem is whether the barrier of this transition is finite or infinite. We argue in this section that the bar-rier is in fact infinite and the Higgs branch remains stable.

One aim of DLA absorptibnlillr:sle spectroscopy is to beable to measure elemental abundances. In the case of S, we are often limited to the S II lines described in this paper. These can bc used to infer the S+ column density,but to get abundances we must estimate the ionization fraction ratio S+/S.
First, note that Feynman-diagram-based calculations of the allomal?? only reproduce the anomaly in de Rham cohomology, and so are not sensitiveto the sorts of 2-torsion effects that are relevant here.

Finally, we searched for phase variations in the RV signal between the FEROS (SHL08) and CORALIE data, obtained with a time span of about one year. The results show that no measurable phase shift was found over more than 300 days to a precision of 1%.

We also provide a simple model, based on a mapping between the DNA knot dynamics and a biased continuous time random walks, which faithfully reproduces our Brownian dynamics simulations starting from a minimal number of assumption. This approach can then be used to predict how the shape of the electrophoretic arc should depend on system parameters such as the average lattice spac-ing (pore size) of the gel and the contour length of DNA knots; as we shall see, the predicted trends are in agreement with existing lwp-dImenti,,nal electrophoresis data. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first example of a quantitative prediction of two-dimensional electrophoretic diagrams, hence we sug-gest thatthe ap-proach we present could potentially lead to even more accurate and targeted experiments to separate topoisomers in DNA or other polymers.
As in the non interacting case, the fibre modulus is able to provide suitable description of dark energy even triionh it does not address the coincidence problem.

We explored in this paper the phase diagram of a non trivial system. The effective energy and momentum, as weh as the number of dunes and the total volume of these dunes are not conserved at the scale of the whole system. The model has a peculiar phenomenology, inspired by the geophysical problem of barchan fields. In partic-ular, dunes interact with each other through non trivial collisions and remote volume exchange. Dunes are injected in the ficld, while volume loss at each oneof them ensures they have a finite lifetime. Two parameters, co inp Ar i ng forti ng and dissipation for ξ, isolated and interacting behavior for η, define the phase diagram.

While there are several protocols that enable users to privately compute the summary of their values, in many cases, as in the case of KDK, thereare several hidden im-plementation bottlenecks which can significantly delay the calculations of different stages of the protocol.In this work we indicate that for instance the multi-round KDK protocol, due its heavy reliance on pairings is not practical at present for large numbers of users n > 100, whereas PCL is highly practical in t h e s e cases at the expense of reduced collusion tolerance. We showed that further customization of the privacy level facilitates further extensions to both protocols, and such extensions were shown to be secure. If applied, these extension can boost the efficiency of both these protocols, leading to faster applications with customizable levels of privacy.

In thispaper, we study the voting systems, where voters can be grouped into parties (or interest groups) and the party members are required to follow party discipline, that is, t h e voters of the same party s h o u l d all vote according to the party pref-erence. In this setting, the outcome of the voting can be easily predicted, once the preferences of all parties are declared. Such voting scenarios can be found in various real-world applications, for e xample, parliament voting and board elections of universities.

In contrast to the FO case, for C I P T each order n just depends on the corresponding coefficient cn1. Thus, all contributions proportional to the coefficient cn1 which in FOPT appear at all perturba-tive orders equal or greater to n are resummed into a single term. This is related tothe fact that CIPT resums \h.e running of the QCD coupling along the integration contour i?n the complex s-plane. To l)erforM the contour in-tegration, we have to analytically continue the strong coupling αs to the complex s-plane, but this is straightforward since the dependence of αs on s is only logarithmic and it has the same cut structure as Π(s).

For the (2,6) superlattice, the narrowing and lowering of the gap has caused the upper edge of the gap to come below the FT frequency, leaving the FT mode once again well within the bulk phonon continuum.

Our goal here is to motivate the length scale based approach to effective field theoriesused in this paper.

Without loss of generality we can assume that Φ(G) = 1. First weshall show that every proper subgroup A of H is abelian. Let C = CG(F(G)). Then C ≤ F(G) since G is soluble. On the otherhand, Claim (4) implies that F(G) ≤ D, so C ≤ D. It follows that F(DA) = F(G), so AF(G)/F(G)≃A is abelian since DA is supersoluble by Clai m (2). Therefore, if H is not abelian, then H is a Miller-Moreno group.
The main contribution of the paper thus lies in investigating how the forecasts of volatility vary with different realized measures and mainly testing the time-frequency realized measures in forecasting. We show that the mostimportant information influencing the future volatility is car-ried by the high frequency part of the spec-tra r e p r e s e n t i n g very short investment horizons of 10 minutes. This decomposition gives us an interesting insight into the volatility process. Moreover, we utilize jumps estimated by the JWTSRV estimator to build a Realized Jump-GARCH model, which outperforms significantly other models based on different realized measures.
The annealed approximation, introduced by Derrida and Pomeau, has revealed to be a good tool for the computation of the closing probabilities and the approximate solution of the model.
This should be valid throughout the regime in which the shell is moving relativistically, roughly corresponding to ν from the infrared to X-rays.

Among the most interesting of the individual structures, particularly in t h e context of the disk-halo interface in galaxies, are features 10 and 11. These struc-tures lie in the NE portion of the disk of NGC 891 and are almost certain ly conneced with the star-formation activity on this side of the galaxy. This region shows enhanced Hα emission, as well as several structureswhose shapes are reminiscent ofsupershells (Rand et al. 1990; Pildis et al. 1994a). Given the known presence of Hα emission near these two features, though seemingly slightly offset, the quantities derived for these two structures should be considered more uncertain than those derived for the previously discussed features due to Hα contamination in the R-band image.

In summary, we propose a finite difference discretization criterion for the numerical integration of the KPZ growth equation starting from the corresponding generalized discrete Langevin equation. We show that, for any discretization scheme, exists a steady state probability density function of the discrete interface heights compatible witb the continuous ones , after coarse graining. Besides, we derived the KPZ coefficients of the BD model as an example ofour generalized discretization. Finally, our results can be used as a new tool for the direct numerical integration of grow-ing continuous equationsith nonlinear terms due to lat-eral growth like the KPZ one.

In summary, our measurements appear to confirm that the magneticallydissipated energyis sufficient to explain thermal and nonthermal en-ergies in solar flares, which strongly supports the view that magnetic reconnection processes are the p r i mary energy source of flares. The nonthermal energy, which represents the primary energy source of the thick-target model, is sufficient to explain the full amount of thermal energies i n 71% of the flares, a c c o r d i n g to the novel warm-target model (Kontar et al. 2011). However, the derived nonthermal energies exe highly dependent on the the assumed temper-ature in the warm-target plasma, for which a sound physical model should be developed (see for instance Appendix A and B), before it b e c o m e s a useful tool to estimate the low-energy cutoff of nonthermal energy spectra. Future studies of this global flare energetics project may also quantify additional forms of energies, such as the kinetic energy i n CMEs, and radiated energies in soft X-rays, EUV, and white-light (bolometric luminosity).

We have succeeded in using lattice Monte-Carlo methods to extract non-perturbative physicsfrom Born-Infeld electrodynamics, quantized using the Euclidean-time functional integral approach. The on-axis (quantum) electrostatic fields of a point charge are measured as functions of the chage e introduced as a Wilson Line. The approach of Lüscher and Weisz, which reduces these measurements from an exponential- to a polynomial-time problem, was essential for extracting these quantities.

Not shown is the difference in molecular abundances. Here there is a resolution dependence on the formation time scale for molecular coolants, as discussed in Paper I. However, the amount f o r m e d is always sufficient to cool the cloud enough to produce the same final outcome. The final a b u n d a n c es a re n e a r l y identical at each refinement level except at the lowest resolution, which is different only outside of the dense regions in the final ribbon. Aside from features that do not affect the final distribution of star-forming gas, our results ru independent of resolution from lmax = 4 to lmax = 6.

In the context of this feedback process, we can now examine what the observed parameters no\[' tile _disk of our Galaxy imply for its formation history. The age of the disk stars in the Milky tVay can be used asa diagnostic to pin down the redshift of assembly. Also, constraints can be obtained on the frlequecy of accretion events in our halo if the bulk of the stars in the Milky Way disk assembled at z > 1. The thick disk stars have a relaxed exponential profile and were henceprob-ably in place quite early on. Moreover, since the relaxation time-scale for stellar systems is l o ng c o m p a r e d to their typical dynamical times, these stars most probably formed in situ. Chemical evolution models of our galaxy seem to indicate that a constant star-formation rate is not a bad description (Wyse & Gilmore (1995)), implying that half the stellar mass of our G ala?y prbabLy assembled well before z = 1.

Some charge is transferred from the visible to the dark sector and this charge acts asa source for the Goldstone boson, so that it be-comes time-dependent.

An opinion that loses all of its followers is forever lo s t (unless the model involves some random noise that repopulates it). Absence of an opinion may block the migration of agents in tbe opinion space.

Two-dimensional models like quantum chromodynamics in two dimensions (QCD2), are convenient frameworks to discuss these kind of phenomena since they pr e se n t the basic aspects of the fun-damental four dimensional theories (such as the existence of nontrivial topological sectors and chirality properties) and, further-more, analytical results can be generally obtained.
A simple 3-parameterclassification scheme was used to identify spectral features. The scheme allocates each galaxy spectrum a code number frora 0 to 2 according to the strength of spectral featnes in each of the following three categories: early-type absorption lines (molecular features such as H, K, CN, Mg), Balmer series absorption lines (H γ, Hδ, etc.), and nebular emission lines (OII, OII I, Hβ etc.). Thisis physically motivated by the typical features produced by stellar populations at progressive stages during and after star-formation. We have selected an un-biased subsample of 56 galaxies which were classified using this scheme, and then collected into six broad classes with physical motivation, as follows: Class A, strong absorption lines; Class B, weak absorption lines;Class C, weak features; Class D, strong balmer lines; Class E , strong emission lines; Class F, Strong Balmer and Emission lines. We note that thle,~;e classes are not directly related to any structural morphology.

Hence the supremum cannot be taken on the interior. We conclude that at least some h2i + 1 + h2i have to be o,ne. Tliere is then a minimal i for which this holds. We can convince ourselves that the process can now be repeated for the substr in g ending at i + 1. Repeating the argument we can fill up all the entr ies up to place i + 1 with the condition h2l + 1 + h2l = 1 and proceeding now upwards we end up with

In this let-ter, we study the exchange interaction between 5d5 electrons in the t2g orbitals with large SO interaction on the basis of J-J coupling scheme as a typical model of 5d electron systems. It is shown that the FM Ising interaction (quantum compass model) occurs in the edge-shared bond due to a selection rule of hybridization between Γ7 and Γ8orbitals. Simultaneously, an isotropic AFM Heisenberg interaction appears from the hybridization between Γ7 orbitals. These two interactions can be clearly distinguished by the second-order perturbation processes. It is also found that the FM Ising ilter?actu becomes very small in the large SO region, which is overlooked in ref.7. As a result, we find that the interaction between 5d5 electrons changes from the FM Is-ing to the AFM Heisenberg interaction as SO interaction increases.

One of the mostimportant coolants for white dwarfs during their early phases is neutrino emission. The processes that produce neutrinos in white dwarfs differ from the neutrino pro-duction associated with nuclear fusion. In a dense plasma, neutrinos canplay the role that photons play in more ordinary stellar material. When photons are produced in these interactions, they quickly thermalize with the plasma because of electromagnetic scattering. But when neutrinos are produced, they are not ther-malized and leave the st ar, taki nhl ueS? their share of the int~mclioen energyaway with them. Thus neutrino emission is an energy sink, rather than a source.

Additionally, we perform an analysis of the radial veloci-ties of 134 clusters with properties obtained in this paper and from the literature. These clusters exhibit a wide range in properties and locations, with ages from a few Myr to 10 Gyr, Galactocentric radii under 6 kpc to outside of 20 kpc, and distances fromthe Galactic plane of over 2 kpc. With a sample of this size we are able to look at trends in kinematics with age and Galac-tic location. We especially utilize the wide range in ages to learn more about the evolution of cluster rotation.
The (y,z) pI~nc at x =0 , where the Polyakov loop jumps, is called a domain wall. This is a little confusing, because we think of a do-main wall as a soliton, living sub specie aeternitatis.

Basic properties
Taking into account all the available experimental constraints/results, esp0ciaH~ the 125 GeV SM-like Higgs bo-son at t he LHC and the muon anomalous magnetic moment, we have studied the EWSUSY in details in the NMSSM for three scenarios. Using χ2 statistic test, we obtained the most favorable regions in the whole parameter space. Moreover, we found that the LHC SUSY searches for neutralinos/charginos and sleptons have already put considerable constraints on the electroweak SUSY sector. And then the favored model parameter space and the resulting mass spectra are modified accordingly. After the systematic analyses, we are led to the following conclusions:
The radiation-reaction force controls the rate at which orbits inspiral. This force can be expressed in terms of i,ilo\ rate of change of orbital elements, such as binding energy, angular momentum and the Carter constant. Since we restrict attention to an equatorial, quasi-circular EMRI geometry, we need to consider only the energy flux.

We stress our focus on minimizing search-time of the query, and the data structure r?hat Cnablcs it, rather than detection perfor-mance which is f i xe d by the choice of algorithm. Choosing sampleimages as queries ensures that the chosen algorithm will positively detect (at least) a loop closure when one is there. However, to avoid criticalities in the evaluation, we remove the query image from the dataset, but assume that there is a true match with neighboring images or keyframes. In some cases, the neighboringkeyframesmaybesufficiently different to fail the test, hence introducing spurious errors in the evaluation as these should be considered loop closures. This occurs, for instance, when the dataset is severely temporally down-sampled, as in the Oxford set. However, this handicap is shared by all meth-ods, thus making our evaluation of therelative improvement due to the adoption of our data structure, fair.

Thetime lags of the plume detachment and post-plumephases have beencalculated as follows. We take the radially averaged temperature field at z ≈ 5δT for each snapshots in the window. If this value exceeds the mean bulk temperature it is assigned with a detachment event otherwise it belongs to the post-plume phase. By applying this simple procedure, the time se-ries is digitalized. The resulting step function has shorter and longer time periods for both dynamical building blocks. The mean time of p l u me d e t a c h m e n t and post-plume is about the same and gives about 0.45Tf for Ra = 3 × 109 where we haD a sufficiently long time series.

When the protein dynamical transition t a~es place, atomic displacements begin to correlate and start covering much larger length scales. Various collective motions such as fluctuations between different macromolecular sub-states make the scene, take over and rule the inter-nal dynamics of the protein lattice all the way to physiological tcperaI;ures? This becomes reflected in the B-factors that should now display a more rapid, maybe even exponential increase as a fu n c ti o n of temperature.

We note that the uncertainties calculated using log-normal realisations assume ΛCDM, and represent the variance we would expect to measure in a Λ CDM universe.

However, calculating uncertainties this way gives a valid co nsi s ten cy check of ΛCDM.

Neither model /s based on the remaining statistics. The first and most obvious thing to note is that the link-based model does extremely poorly when it comes to m a tchin g clustering while the SUGM does much better, which is nat-ural given that the SUGM explicitly includes triangles. More interestingly, conditioning on the triangles in the SUGM is enough to deliver better matches on all of the other dimensions. For instance, the link-based model considerably underestimates the first eigenvalue ( 3 . 8 6 as compared to 5.54), whereas the SUGM performs better (4.68).

Macroscopic systems pose an intriguing question on the level of irreversibility. Consider a many-particle system displayingan order-disorder phase transition whose microscopic dynamicsdoes not obey detailed balance. Does the broken detailed balance result in time-reversal symmetry breaking at the macroscopic level? On the one hand, one may expec t that entropy productions of each particle add up to a ma c ros c opic amount irrespective of a raa(:raspeoscoplc state. On the other hand, if the system is in a disordered phase so that allconfigurationsarealmost equally li kely, then irreversibility may not show up on a macroscopic level producing only a subextensive amount of entropy. A svtem in an ordcrc:d state has a l o w er e n tr o py t h an in a disordered state. Then, which phase produces more total en-tropy including the system entropy and the environmental entropy? These questions lead us to the study of the entropy production in a model system undergoing nonequilibrium phase transition.

We have seen in the previ-ous sec-tions that a low-energy measurement is extremely difficult because of the small-ness of the QED effect and be-cause of the large background noise, that must be suppressed to a very high degree to carry out the actual measurement, as well as because of systematic effects that must all bekept in check. However thephoton-photon cross section is a fast- growing function of the photon energy, and a higher-energy me a-s u re men t would be an interesting alternative approach. In this section we brieflyconsider the basics of photon-photon scattering, and how itrelates to the underlying QED structure, andput forward some suggestions for possible experiments at a dedicated photon-photon scattering facility.

It is thus interesting to perform a separate calculation of t he potential between external charges.

Although it is impossible to rewrite a crossed graph exactly as an iterate of the ladder ker-nel K(2), the leading contributions of these graphs ro the high-energy and one-body limits are iterative. This can beeasily shown in the case of the fourth-order crossed-box graph. In both of the field theories defined in the Introduction, this graph corresponds to an expression:
reduces to a Hamiltonian for the transverse degrees of freedom
Having identified these various scales, we note now that the thermodynamical functions at high temperature are dominated by hard degrees of freedom. The quasiparticle picture that we shall develop takes into account consistently the contributions of the hard degrees of freedom together with those of the long wavelength collective excitations. We shall comment later on the techniques based on di-mensional reduction which al-los a treatment of the ultrasoft contributions.

If an initial field c o n f i g u r a t i o n has a finite helicity, it can not decay further than the lowest energy state with the same helicity (a-gain as long as reconnection may be ignored). In practice, reconnection cannot be ignored since diffusion will be important on small length scales, and rapid reconnection can happen through regions with dynamically-generated small length scales. Nevertheless, it is found that in practice helic-ity conservation is often a good approximation on a large scale, even when reconnection takes place on smaller scales inside the co nf i guratio n.
In this section, we will review the theories of L-functions and base change. Those already familiar with them may wish to skip to the proof in the next section.

The magnetisation loops measuredfor different directions of the applied field in the (100) plane, proved that the magnetic behaviour is not isotropic in the plane. We have chosen two symmetry directions in the (100) plane which present distinct magnetic behaviour. The first direction is along the projection in the (100) plane of the bisecting line of two Ni - Cr - Ni molecular directions, showed to be an easyaxis of magnetization. The second direction perpendicular to the first one, showed to be a hard axis of magnetization. The corresponding magnetizations versus applied field curvesare presented in figure 2(a, b). In the first orientation (figure 2a), the magnetization is reversed from the negative saturation value to the positive sat-uration value in zero field. When increasing the temperature, the saturation magnetization ?d\ee~-~,qt:~? but the zero field slope remains constant below0.6 K . This is confirmed by the magnetic susceptibility measured in this direction (see cingI6~nrobe\ 3a).

We then use these results to identify mod-els with certain additional structures, in analogy to the bi-metric case. Focussing on the case N = 2, we first demand scale invariance of the proportional background solutions. This requirement translates into conditions on the interaction parameters which, in contrast to bimetric theory, do not lead to a unique model but leave us with a subset of free parameters. O u r procedure can also be applied to general N and we use it to explicitlyderive (highly symmetric) examples of models with scale invariant backgrounds.

We conjectured that we ,couldbe only one step behind M2M conver-sion. An M2M conversion system has two requirements. First, it must be capable of convert an arbitrary, even unseen, sourceto a given target. Second, it must be able to convert a source to a target that never appears in the training phase, but has limited resources during conversion. Conceptually, our framework has the ability to accommodate M2M tasks. This could be achieved by introducing a speaker recognition net w ork ( in the fo rm of another encoder) to replace the given speaker representation (one-hot vector in our case). Or, the speaker representation could be in other forms. Once the specker representation of the unknown target speakers is obtained from the limited speech, it is likely that the decoder can b l e n d speaker and phn'"emtic rep-resentations to synthesize a speaker-dependent spectral frame, ~h\[l achieving M2M conversion.

A second synthetic dataset is generated from aresidual mixture model and we show that the mixture selection selects the distribution that betterapproximates the true mixture distribution. Finally, a thrid synthetic data includes outliers to show that the presented methodology selects a m ode l capable of offering ro-bust estimation to regression fixed effects.

In conventional mag-nets with a long-range order, the local fields are static in the ordered phase. However, in CuB2O4, the local fields are quasi-static in the bea-k ferromagnetic phase, whereas the fluctuating component becomes dominant at lower temperatures and persists even at 0.3 K. Such a thermal evolution is rather anomalous. Finally, we discuss two possible origins of the fluctu-ating fields observed below TN.

A protein is composcd by a long chain of a few hundred amino-acids and its chemical composition is specified by the sequence of aminoacids (primary structure). I n physiological situations, normally a protein folds in an unique way (tertiary structure). During the foidi\n^,the protein goes to the configuration of minimal energy (more precisely, tothe configuration of minimal free energy). However, there are many q u hi t ?e d~f ferent c n o n fi gur a tio n s of the protein which have an energy near the minimal one. There are proteins, which are called allosteric, which have two configurations which practically thesame energy). Sometimes, if we perturb the protein by" a small amount, e.g. changing the pH or changing only one aminoacid in the chain, the folding changes dramatically. We can also select one of the two different confi gurat ion by the binding of a lig-and.

Detection of the Q series allows an estimate f the extinction toward these blobs from pairs of lines arising from the same upper level v=1-0 S(1), Q(3), S(0), Q(2) (Beckwith et al. 1979). These ratios ren-der an approx-imate visual extinction of 7 mag. In our e xcitation diagrams, we compare the (unreddened) measured line ratios of severallines to the predictions of both an LTE model at 2000K and a high-density photodissociation region model (Draine & Bertoldi, 1996). The measured line ratios are well fit by a purely thermal single-temperature model of around 3000K. The low extinction measured suggests that a high-density PDR and a strong UV field can be ruled out in favor of a shock scenario. The confirmation of the shock nature of the line emission associated to nr114 therefore reinforces the hypothesis that this source is extremely young.
The specific ionization states indicated by the observed lines suggest that there are a number of components with different values of ξ, the density form of the ionization parameter. However, these all have the sa,ne value (Ξ = Ξc) o f the pressure form of the ionization parameter.Above Ξc, low-temperature equilibria do not exist, and the temperature rises from ≃3 × 104 K to ≃106 K with Ξ very nearly constant at Ξc. If these components coex-ist at the same distance from the central source, they share the same pressure, suggesting a volume-filling configuration by which the pressure is regulated. If the volume-filling phase is the highest attainable temperature on the marginally stable branch of the thermal equilibriumcurve, the actual distance could be substantially smaller than the maximum; a factor of ten smaller would not be surprising.

Thec(;nTral equilibrium concept in game theory is the Nash Equilibrium.

Players are in equilibrium if a change in strategies by an y one of them would leadthat player to earn less than if he remained with his current strategy. A Nash equilibrium satisfies the following condition

Conclusions
The non-thermalization inthe closely neighborhood does no t mean that there are no thermalized regions. When the local thermalization by the Hawking radiation is realized, the local temperature distributionT(r) should be a function of distance from the center of the black hole r because of its spherical symmetry. The Hawking radiation initially should thermalize a sphere with theradius

Combining clustermembership with photometry allows for more accurate determinations o f properties such as age, distance, and to some extent metallicity. Cluster membership is particularly important in crowded fields where field star contamination is high, because not only does it separate the cluster from the field, which allows for more accurate determination of the cluster properties, it also allows for specific selection of cluster stars for future observations with spectroscopy for elemental abundances.

To minimize the uncertainty dueto experimental differences between the 1999 and 2002 data, we no rma li z ed the yield of ω mesons with carbon targets in the 1999 data to that in 2002 data and extracted the abso-lute cross sections in p + p collisions. Another uncertainty arose from the differ-ence in the target thicknesses that were measured with an accuracy of 0.8%. We obtained 20.1% and 20.0% as the systematic uncertainty in p + p collisions for the ω mesonproduction and φ meson production, respectively.

Dwarf galaxies have long presented a particular challenge to CDM. Most people are now familiar withthe problem that CDM models tend to produce steep luminosity functions and too many low-luminosity galaxies (e.g., White & Frenk 1991; Kauffmann, White, & Guiderdoni 1993). It is usually assumed that this can be cured by invoking supernova (SN) feedback, but most models for SN feedback are currently quite ad hoc, and anl. is important to obtain better direct observational con-straints on this process. This is one of the reasons that the study of nearby dwarf galaxies is so important.

We have obtained the general solution of the Friedmann andDBI fieldequations for a constant Lorentz factor when the DBI field is driven by an expo-nential potential. The general solutions has been split into three subsets, power law solutions, an explicit particular solut i ons and the implicit general solution. We have shown that they all share the property that at early and at late times they behave asymptotically as power law solu-tions. The first subset of solutions ~XjalI)O~es enhanced inflation under a form invariance transformation. On the other hand, the asymptotic behavior of the remaining two subsets of solutions at late times indicates that inflation be-comes more probable and it i8 enhanced by the γ factor.

In conclusion, we have grown high-quality Y0.6Pr0.4Ba2Cu3O7/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 superlattices.The interfacial reconstruction was studied by linearly polarized X-ray absorption at the Cu L3-edge. Similar to the inter-face between optimally doped YBCO and LCMO, we observed dramatic modifications includ-ing charge transfer and OR at the interfacial CuO2 plane of Pr-doped YBCO due to the strongly hybridized covalent bond between Cu and Mn. However, differences such as reduced charge transfer and more bulk-like orbital occupation were also :fou\nd. This is presumably related to the Pr-doping which removes holes from the Z R state and suppresses SC. Neutron reflectivitydata revealed temperature-dependent, oscillatory diffuse scattering, indicativeofa significant in-plane modulation, which can be attributed to buckling of the superlattice film due to the structural phase transition of the STO substrate.

Precisely, we consider approximating functionals of mixing processes, where the approximation is in probability, not in an Lp sense as in the usual near epoch dependencecondition. We call this approximation concept P-near epoch dependence. It generalizes Lp-near epoch dependence, notrequiring the existence of any moments, and is hence a fitting framework for nonparametric and robust data analysis.

We see that COrE and SPT/ACT can only be expected to measure mass for the most massive systems in the universe, while Planck can-not be expected to measure any individual cluster mass. The sensitivity of these experiments, however, is sufficient to obtain mean mass as a function of other cluster observables by binning measurements; in other words, to establish mean observable-massscaling relations. Herein lies the value of our matched fil-ter approach, by providing a means of combining many low signal-to-noise measurements to statistically determine cluster mass. The sensitivity of SPT-Pol,SPT-3G/ACT-Pol and the PRISM mis-sion, on the other hand,is sufficient to enable individual cluster mass measurements as well as statistical studies.

Furthermore the presence of the B7 clusters in magnetic ZGNR weakens the magnetism in such systems.

Next we would like to point out that the above R- and L-systems bear a striking resemblance to the right- and left-movers in string theory and there exists a close relationship between the thermodynamics of these systems and that of effective strings or D-branes. Ourreformulation of the first law of black h o le t h e r m o d y n a m i c s can be viewed as an analogy of ther-modynamics of effective string or D -b rane models.

The universality of both charged and neutral weak interactions, combined with the discovery of predicted top quar k, strongly suggests that the weak interac-tions are described by a gauge theory. Or in other words, the W ± and Z0 bosons are gauge bosons. This i\s anatural analogue of the fact that other known universal forces, namely gravity, which acts univerally on all bod-ies (equivalence principle), andelectromagnetism, which gives universal Coulomb force which does not depend on the proper-ties of matter but only on their electric charges, are described by gauge theories. In fact, the universality was tile mhai-n motivation for Glashow to describe the weak interactions by his SU(2)×U(1) gauge theory, or electroweak theory.

These distributions demonstrate a degree of insensitivity to the choice of merging scale, which has been varied over an order of magnitude, however there is still some residual dependence on this choice. While the parton shower and merged matrix element treatments formally have the same large logarithm behavior, there are differences be-tween the two. The degree of these differences will di-rectly influence the amount of residual de-pendence on the merging scalethat is observed. In changing the merging scale we are changing the volume of the matrix element phase space region and therefore changing the proportion of parton emissions that are corrected by exactmatrix elements.

In the following we present adaptive schemes for choosing the number of processors that apply both to offspring populations as well as island models of EAs. We accompany our schemes by a rigorous theoretical anal-ysis of their running time. Both schemes double the number of processors if the current generation fails to produce an offspring that has larger fitness than the current best fitness value. Otherwise, if the generation yields an i m p r o v e m e n t , the number ofprocessors is decreased again. The difference between the two schemes lies in the way the number of processors is decreased.

In this paper, we present atheoretical study of the current-induced dynamics of skyrmions that correctly accounts for the effects of SOC on both current-induced torques and magnetization damping. Our results demonstrate that SOC generates reactive anddissipative homogeneous SOTs that lead to important corrections to the drift velocity a l o n g the current direction and to the Magnus force. Another essential consequence of the SOC is that the skyrmions experience effective damp-ingand torque parameters that depend on the current direction relative to the crystallographic axes.

Itis worth to pointing that our mGNM and mANM methods are not unique. How to design optimal new mGNM and mANM methods is still an open problem. Essentially, we hope these new methods are efficient, accurate and ro-bust. More specifically, high accuracy in B-factor prediction is a mai?n criterion. Additionally, having the abilityto provide correct protein domain analysis is a desirable property as well. For mANM, the capability of offering correct motion analysis is a major requirement. The quality of both domain and motion analy-ses depends on how to design non-diagonal matrix elements so as to properly reflect the physical connectivity among particles.

The \simidGdion used to determine the probability distribution for the test statistic will always have zero counts in these bins, that is, there will always be agreement between thetwo histograms in these bins. Thus, the simulation will finp? that values of the test statistic are more probable than it should.

It is interesting to note that the radio continuum source toward which the H I is d e t e c t e d (Figure 3) is the location where the radio jet begins to change its position angle. This would suggest that, as for exam-ple in the case of 3C236 (Conway 1999), the H I absorption marks the location of a jet/cloud interaction responsible for disturbing (and possibly bending) t h e jet. How-ever, the B2352+495 morphology is quite symmetric in both radio lobes which suggests that the deviation of the radio jets is not due to local jet/cloud interactions but governed by the large scalemagnetohydrodynamical properties of l.,h e galactic nucleus. In the next section, we propose a different interpretation for the nature of the H I absorption in B2352+495.

So f ar , we assumed that the system size N(the number of cells) is constant, which is a good approximation for an adult organism; in a developing organism, however, proportion regulation has to workunder the condi-tion of a steadily growing system size. Here, we study this problem for two simplified settings: first, for symmetric growth, i.e., new cells are added with proba-bility 1/2 on ei-ther side of the chain of cells, and the growth rate rg isconstant onaverage; second, for homogeneous cell proliferation with probability pd per cell, assuming that daughter cells inherit the state of the mother cell.

In sum-mary, we have found thata THz field may cause dynamical separations of the DNA double-strand. In the presence of weak perturbations e.g. thermal fluctuations, sprall amplitude response oc-curs (at half the driving frequency) either in a spatially uni-form manner or, at higher-frequencies, in an unusu al spa-tially dimerized form. In the latter case, neighboring base pairs oscillate in anout-of-phase fashion. However, large localized openings (bubbles) in the DNA double strand can only occur via a nonlinear mechanism requiring a spatial perturbation above a certain amplitude thrébold that is determined by the intensity and the frequency of the THz field.

Additionally, we showed that the methods are not limited to the graph Laplacian setup but can successfully be employed for the hypergraph Laplacian. Future work should incorporate more sophisticated eigenvalue methods and our goal is to further investigate different techniques for the se g m e nt at io n of hypergraphs.

For the sake of a better explanation, we start with a description of the practical aspect of the adopted procedure. The Minkowski functionals of a body K in the plane are proportional to its area A(K), perimeter U(K) and the connectivity or Euler number χ(K). The usual definition of theconnectivity from algebraic topology in two dimensions is the difference between t h e number of connected nc components and the number of holes nh,

Initially l;bIn problems were solved by the introduction of color-octet (CO) components of the quarkonia, that arise aturaUy in the non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD), where the expansion over the rela-tive velocity of quarks in meson is performed. In thismodel it is assumed, that final meson is formed from heavy quark pair in color-octet state, that subsequently transforms into a physically observed col-orless meson. In the framework of NRQCD the probabilities of these transitions are described by the matrix elements of four-fermion operators, that a re determined from the experirn(~ntal distributions over the transverse momentum of final charmonium. We would like to stres8,ho?wever,that this explanation will not work for charmonium production at lowerenergies. The reason is that the distributions caused by octet compo-nents decreases slowly with the rise of the tra nsvers e momentum, but the probability to find such a component in the meson is small, compared withthe singlet case. As a result, in the large transverse momentum region the contribution of octet components can be significant, but for small energies and transverse momenta it is suppressed.

Stationary cyclic Gaussian processes
The statistical uncertainties of the eclipse maps were estimated with a Monte Carlo procedure (e.g., Rutten et al. I992). A set of 20 artificial light curves i s generated, in which the data points are independently and randomly varied according to a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation equal to the uncertainty at that point. The light curves are fitted with the eclipse mapping algorithm to produce a set of randomized eclipse maps. These are combined to produce an average map and 0, tnap of the residuals with respect to the average, which yields the statistical uncertainty at each pixel.
In particular, we have demon-strated that it should be possible to detect extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs around such A-F type stars: detection limits arrive at the planetary domain for most of them.

The swimmer, a q-swimmer, is an object with internal degrees of freedom which, we assume, are slow and classi-cal while the degrees of freedom of the medium are fast and quantum. Swimming is accom-plished by the internal degrees of freedom, the controls, undergoing periodic cycles. An example of a q-swimmer might be a molecule immersed in a quantum gas. The control of the internal configuration might be either external (through lr,l~ application of external fields) or internal (ue to autonomous dynamics).

In classical theory of PDEs, two important classes of equations are: elliptic and parabolic PDEs. They are second-order PDEs, with some constraints (coerciveness) in the higher-order terms. The elliptic equations typically model the flow of some chemical quantity within some region, whereas the parabolic equations model the time evolution of such quantities. Consider the following particular classes of elliptic and parabolic equ a tio ns:

Noise of the tylf~ modelled here can be distinguished from other noise sources. For instance, in trapped-ion systems, if Johnson-Nyquist noise is the dominant source of fluctuating electric fields, this will predominantly originate in the attendant electronics in the system, rather than the ion-trap electrodes themselves. Consequently the noise level varies as a function of the temperature of the electronics. In contrast, noise due to dielectric coverings on the electrodes varies as a function of the electrode temperature, which can be controlled independently ofthe attendant electronics.

If the sample is large enough, one can instead split the supernovae int o N bins of redshift and average the observed flux over all supernovae in the same bin.

The paper is organized a~ follows. In Scc, II, we define the entanglement entropy for a snapshot, which is a key ingredient in thist paper, and present outline of our method. Then, m Sec. III, b a s ic p r o p e r t i e s of the entanglment entropy and the entanglement spectrum for square-lattice Ising ferromagnet are presented. The main objective is to show temperature and system-size de-pendence of the entropy as well as the spectrum in order to extract scaling relations. We also examine entanglement sup-port of our method by changing the number of the singular values which are taken into account. In Sec. IV, coarse-grained snapshots are shown, and we discuss about the key mechanism of the length-scale control hidden in the SVD. In Sec. V, we examine the 3-state Potts model in order to confirm universality of our scaling relations obtained in the analysis of the Ising model. In Sec. VI, we discuss about the topological entanglement entropy in a viewpoint of the entanglement gap. Finally, we summarize our results.

This pa-per is organized as follows. In section 2, the setup considered here is described and generalized Einstein equations with time dependence are explicitly expressed. I n the simplest case of an isolated tw-bralil(; system, we give the higher dimensional Friedmann-type equation on the brane. In section 3, wesolve the static (5 + D)-dimensional Randall-Sundrum model with the bulk cosmological constant Λ. For each case of Λ < 0, Λ > 0, and Λ = 0, the (4 + D)-dimensional metric functions can be obtained.We show that the forms of the warpedmetric functions and the relation between the brane tensions on theorbifold depend on the inte-gration constant appearing in the Einstein equations as well as on the sign of the bulk cosmological constant. A summary and discussion are given in the final section. In an appendix, we review the Kasner so-lution of the (4 + D)-dimensional anisotropic cosmological model.
Tbere is no reason to believe the above approximation when b < lNC. In this case the i n t e ra c t i o n s between an instanton and an anti-instanton is wel t described by the gauge fields which are low energy modesof IIB matrix model. They are close to diagonal degrees of freedom in IIB matrix model. Their contri-bution can be estimated by gauge theory. The oneloop effective potential can be calculated by gauge theory certainly when b < <lNC
From the annealed approximation we expect the stationary distribution not todepend on l, but in fact we could oI)serve different behaviours for different l va l u es . So the data analysis is rathercomplex since for every point (K, ρ) in parameter space three varables, N, t and l, are involved and different limits, e.g. N large at fixed t and l or t and l l a r g e at fixed N, may give different behaviours.
We expect that massive stars are l i k e l y to be responsible f or the sig-nificant number of bright red infrared matches to the hard X-ray sources in the S g r B region.Indeed, this area contains the most massive molecularcloud known in the Galaxy, in w ivich bver 6 0 ultra-compact H ii regions are embedded (Gaume et al. 1995; de Pree et al. 1998). Naturally, t h i s is a site of vigorous, massive star formation. Infrared spectroscopy of red matches in this region will likely reveal hot supergiants, similar to those already identified near the Arches and Quintuplet clusters. Theidentification of such stars near Sgr B will constrain the history and mode of massive star formation in this region.

This brings us to the subject of single-event measurements: event mixing is, of course, not possible when there is just one available. For the proposed measurement of Bose-Einstein correlations in single events in nuclearcollisions at RHIC and LHC, the solution is o~(lalearly to normalize by event mixing based on a sample of similar events. Most notably, this mixing sample should have the same multiplicity and general characteristics; such requirements will necessar-ily restrict the sample to relatively few events, so that the bias corrections may become important.

Extensive calculations obtained with three independent stellar evolution codes have enabled us to consistently induce or remove GNLs according to the helium-composition profile at the end of core-helium burning. We have shown that GNLs are not favored by higher metallicities or lower ma s s es , as postulated by Bono et al. (1997a,b). Rather, GNLs are produced by the narrowness of the helium-burning region when tile helium-burning shell ignites immediately following core-helium exhaustion. This is most influenced by the way that the convective and semiconvective regions are calculated atthe completion of core-helium burning and further illustrates our incomplete knoWlqlge of this complicated phase. If we couldobservationally determine the existence, or otherwise, of GNLs, it would be a direct probe into the helium profile at helium exhaustion and hence provide information about the occurrence of core-breathing pulses.
To complete the proof of Theorem 4.1, we summarize our situation: we have a nontrivial semi-simple group Deruc(H) with an irreducible unitary representation. Furthermore, it has a special element x whose im-age under the reintebsenq;al;ian has exactly two distinct eigenvalues whoseratio is not ±1.
Another im-portant aspect is that for many quantities of phenomenological r e l e v a n c e, t h e r e exlst a large numberof calculations using different a c t i o n s , different approaches to renormalization, etc. Furthermore, lattice theorists are curious to try out n ew a p p r o a c h es so t h a t more recent does not necessarily imply more reliable or accurate. The situation can thus be very confusing for non-experts, as it is even for experts! It would therefore be v e r y use-ful to have a body of theoreticians well versed in the different possible lattice approaches, which could review the situation and provide a succinct and reliable summary of the state of the art. We also owe it to ourselves to make the best possible use of the results and experience that we have accumulated.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that the Coulomb re-pulsion can bound electrons in multi-well periodic structures, so that a current of eritatlle(I electrons with opposite spins would appear. The prop-agation of such electron pairs across the system is dominated by direct two-electron transitions absent in the standard Hubbard model. We expect t hat tHese two-electron transitions play an important role in different physical processes.

So far we have discussed emission inconstant classical fields. However, one of the defining features of a Q E D - p l a s ma is t h at t he emission processes can influence these fields. Radiation reaction exerts a drag force, altering the velocity of the electrons and positrons and so altering the current in the plasma. Although no net current is produced in the pair production process, it acts as a source of current carriers. Subsequent accelerationby the background fields separates the electron and positron which then alter the current in the plas-ma. These modifications to the current effect the evolution of the macroscopic fields.

In conclusion, the DM interpretation of the 3 events reported by the CDMS-II collaboration is not entirely excluded by XENON10/100. This mass region is very interesting theoretically and can be accessed with relatively small ex-periments employing light target nuclei. In view of our ignorance concerning the possible interactions of DM, it is essential that experimental searches employ as many different target nuclei as is possible.
Since we identify the AD flatdirection as the inflaton that has an initial value larger than the Planckmass in the chaotic inflation, the supergravity effects should be taken into account. In the framework of supergravity, the effective potential is modified as
In fact,
Not all stars that are born in binaries are expected to show this peculiar chem-istry from AGB accre-tion. Close binaries cannot evolve up the AGB because they undergo mass transfer before or during shell hydrogen burning on the first giant branch. Very wide binaries have stars that are so far separated that they do not interact except through their mutual gravitational attraction. The intermediate cases are those which interest us: the binary must be wide enoug h to allow evolution up the AGB, but close enough that there is mass transfer (probably) by wind accretion.
At this point it is important to examine whether NSI can obscure the discovery of the standard CP violationdue to δ and the neutrino mass hierarchy, and if yes to what extent.

Marginal sub-criticality of the ISM on average is probably no coincidence (Shu et al. 1999). Heavily supercritical gas clouds have long since eotIapsed cohe form stars. To induce the remaining clouds to collapse, any process has to overcome their notional stability. Successful processes only form st a r s with a l o w efficiency per unit collapse time scale because magnetic flux on a large scale cannot be destroyed but can only be redistributed. Thus, gas that becomes supercritical and collapses can only do so by m a k i n g the remain-ing gas more subcritical and less prone to collapse.

Finally, let us note that one single definite example of unstable physically relevant solution in the theory with higher derivatives would mean that the situation with the (in)stability of vacuum in this theory becomes definitely negative. In view of the great relevance of higher derivatives, especially for quantization o f matter fields on curved background, this would mean the necessity of some dra-matic changes in our understanding, starting from the semiclassical approach to gravity. However, after considerations presented in this work, we have an expec-tation t hat the situation with higher derivatives in atheory based on a unique Planck scale can be resolved.

The spectra of supernova remnants are very similar to those of foreground stars. Following P04 we assumed that all foreground stars have been identifiedfrom the correlation with optical data leaving any remaining sources that fit the HR criteria as supernova remnant candidates. Again, HRs were calculated for typical supernova remnant spectra (absorbed thermal plasma models with temperaturesof 0.5 keV and 1.0 keV) over the same range of column densities as before. All the HRs calculated were within the original criteria and so the criteria were not modified.

QUANTUM LANGEVINEQUATIONS
Because it is often desirable to look at Feynman diagrams for the process being calculated, MadGraph generates a postscript file with these diagrams and the amplitude they correspond to in the code. In principle, graph generation should be trivial once all of the particles and vertices are determined. However, determining an esthetic arrangement of the vertices and particles requires some thought. Thealgorithm used in MadGraph minimizes the sum of the length squared of the lines , This does not always produce perfectly symmetric diagrams, however it is a fairlyeasy procedure t o implement and the diagrams are adequate for research purposes. For each four-gluon vertex thcre are actually three identical graphs rather than just one. This is necessary to account for the three differ-ent color factors in a single four gluon ver-tex.

We have shown that a simple mode with constrained dynamics \[ike the HOSS model, is rich enough to reproduce the Ko-vacs memory effect, even allowing to obtain analytical expression for the Kovacs hump in a long time regime.

The quantitative properties depend on the particular system or model analyzed.

With this restriction, and the assumption of a power-law primary spectrum, the problem simply amounts to determining how the normalizationof the illuminating spectrum at some given energy (E = Eth, say), integrated over the surface of the slab, is affected by the source motion.

This calculation may be carried out exactly, but the result is that, unless for orbits with very small amplitude, the effect of spatial curvature is not really important. It is convenient to compute these kernels as in a spatially flat FRW Universe with the same radius, which amounts to c o n si d e r a continuous, rather than a dis-crete, spectrum of modes.

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Setting
It remains to adapt the PF allocation to account for practical placement constraints that occur in data centers.These include the requirement to allocate CPU and RAMon the same server, for example, or to use a specific type of server for some jobs. It is also of interest to incorporate hierarchical scheduling criteria whereby the departments originat-ing certain classes of jobs have overall service rate guarantees. Available trace data suggests cluster resources are currently significantly over-provisioned so that optimized sharing is hardly an issue in practice. In future, however, one would expect tighter en-ergy management leading to a requirement for more closely controlled performance. The key to this would be analytical modelling enabling one to predict performance given sys-tem capacity and load, by applying tbe robust engineering techniques developed over recent years for networks, for example.

It is well established that, in the context of Newtonian dynamics, the observable mass in spiral galaxies cannot account for tile `ob\sei-ved flat rotation curves in the outer regions of galaxies (Bosma 1978; Begeman 1987, van Albada et al. 1985). Tile standard explanation for this discrepancy is the propo sal that galaxies are embedded in an extended d a r k halo which dominates the gravitational field in the outer regions (Trimble 1987).
But there is absolutely nothing granting us that this Boolean description (thought necessary to exert experiments) will exhaust the scenario in which pheno mena appear. And this lies at the heart of the existence of complementary (and incompatible) contexts in quantum mechanics: in order to determine the state of the system, a quantum tomography must be exerted, and thus, we are obliged to study the system in different incompatible contexts. While the structuration of experience in CM can be reduced to a boolean algebra (and thus, to a set theoretical description provided by an outcome set), in QM this is no longer possible. In classical mechanics, the goryesaription( of an objectcan be equated with its space-time representation: form the point of view of classical mechanics, the main goal isto describe continuous m oti o n of material bodies inside space. Th~+tis why motion (and change) can be described as the solutions of deterministic differential equations. And this feature is much more general than the usual description of a particle mov-ing through space under the action of forces. Any quantity of interest taking continuous values, if it is classical, will have associated a time derivative, and thus the description reduces to the motion of a system in a phase spaceobeying deterministic differential equations. Quite contrarily, quantum mechanics is characterized by jumps, by discontinuous and unpre-dictable behavior. That is why the organization of experience in QMcomes endowedwith a probabilistic description: it is impossible to predict the future events with complete certainty, and thus, the actual state of affairs is just a probability distribution.

The largest deviation was found for the case K = 3, where the annealed approximation gives α =0.182 while our simulations give αL = 0.210, αT = 0.204, αP = 0.21 and αV = 0.206 for the average variancein a given network and 0.205 for t h e variance between different networks.
It was recently realized that this approach described in the previoussection (i.e. to predict the behavior of the system from the knowledge of the equations of motion) fails in the case of c om p lex s y s t e ms for reasons that are very similar(al-beit in a different contest) to those which led to the abandonment of the Newton-Laplace view-point.
In conclusion, the results of this section show us that the computation of the eigenstates and the eigenvalues of the spl(2 | 1) model is still dependent of an additional eigenvalue problem for the inhomogeneous transfer ma-trix T(1)(λ,{λi}). We shall discuss this matter in the nextsection.

Knowing therelative p o s i t i on a nd p e c u l i a r velocity of each galaxy with respect to its host cluster it is easy to reproduce observations of that cluster in the form of projected cluster-centric radii and LOS velocity. The 30 systems are thenstacked, scaling each by the cluster radius (r500) an d velocity dispersion, σv. This stacking over many clusters is not required simply to match our observed sample, or even to mcontain sufficient galaxies to derive robust statistical properties (although this is important), but most importantly to even out all of the large line-of-sight variations due to the presence of infalling struetures or filaments for individual cluster lines of sight and times of observation. This applies both for the simulations and the observations, motivating our use of such large clus-ter samples.

In order for this to happen, the size rg of a giant graviton of momentum L must be smaller than the size ofthe near-horizon region of the gravitons r0.Moreover, when the size of the giant graviton becomes smaller than the string or Planck scale, it makes sense to treat it as a KK graviton.

According to t he r esul t s pre sent ed above, emission mechanisms appear iher ditter-enL in the twomodels. For light particles, a more a bunda nt pre-equilibrium emis-sion(Z < 3) is observed in the BGBD case. Concerningthe IMF emission mechanism, the involved time scales and the relative importance of one- and many-body effects appear different in the two mod-els, due to thedifferences in the implementation of mean-field propagation and two-body scattering. In the BGBD case the fragmentation process follows the spinodal decomposition scenario. Indeed the systen? enters the lowdensity region asa nearly homogeneous source, then de n s it y fluctuations are amplified. The formation of bubble-like structures is ~\avored, as a manifestation of monopole instabilities. In the AMD model, many-body correlations have a stronger impact on the fragmentationdynamics, while m e a n - f i e l d effects appear weaker. Fragment formation seems not to be directly linked with the spinodal decomposition scenario, but rather with the appearance of some pre-fragments at earlier times. As a consequence, fragments are formed on shorter time-scales in AMD. Fina l l y, w e observethat pre-equilibrium and IMF emissions happen on different time scales and are related to differ-ent mechanisms in the BGBD case, while in AMD the distinction of the two time scales is not as clear as in BGBD.
Labeling all words with a spec\illc tag yields maximal recall for that tag, as all words occur re n c e of that tag are labeled correctly, yet =ith the price of low precision, as many words are tagged wrongly. On the other hand, not labeling even one word (or l a b e l i n g all word with the special tag of no tag) yields maximal precision for all tags, as there is not even a single word that is labeled mistakenly by somt', tag, yet the precision is zero as none of the words that should be tagged are indeed tagged. \['ieal'ly ono ca n move from the second extreme to the first dby? lab4ling or tag g ing more and more words with some tag. In various informat i on extractionsystems it is desirable to have the ability to control the tradeoff between high precision or high recall. In some scenarios a user may prefer that the system may label fewer words with a tag (low recall) yet to have the labeled words be tagged correctly (high precision), and in another scenarios the opposite is preferred, that is, labeling more words with some tag, yet at the price of low precision.

On the other hand, if the attack is launched on Flow 2 (that skips the FTP upload to the base station), it may not be as easy to detect. Since the attack uses the same functions that are invoked by legitimate code, it looks like the application is following Flow 1 (where t h e FTP upload is actually legitimate). In this case, only 1% of the malicious code executions were caught. The detection rates would be significantly higher if the attacker either used different images that vary in size or used code that utilizes different combinations of system calls . The l a tter case would also hold for the HTTP pos+ attack. Note: the detection was not successful bec~use we tailored the attack instance to closely match legitimate execution (especially due to our knowledge of the detection methods); however, m any attacks will not be ableto m at ch l egi timate execution in such a precise manner and will end up being caught.

In this p a p e r , we have calculated eigen-values and eigenfunctions -of power-law and logarithmic po ten ti als by using variational techniques for special type wave functions. Our results are in good agreement with existing exact numerical ones. However, for the higher values of ν, there is some difference between two approaches. However this differences not larger than that one coming from 1/N expansion. Moreover, we obtained that present method predicts not only the eigenvalues as well as the eigenfunctions of given potentials. The correspondence of wavefunctions for lower energylevels is very good agreement with numerical results as expected the except case n and l are large. The method used in this study present an easy way of calculating both eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of power-law and logarithmic potentials. In spite of its simple structure, themethod is very practical and the results of the method are in good agreeme\twith exact results.

Accordingly, in this section and the next we explore the network information required tosolve consensus. We start here by investigating the importance of unique ids. We call an algorithm that doe s not use unique ids an anonymous algorithm. We pr ove below that consensus is impossible with anonymous algorithms, even if nodes know the networksize and diameter. We then provide a corollary that extends this result to the standard asynchronous network model. To the best of our knowledge, tha is the first result on the necessity of unique ids for consensus in multihop message passing networks.

At first glance it may seem that applying ridge raregr?evsill to the covariance matrix should be detrimental to determining the actual values of correlation function parameters: we are effectively assuming by fiat that the effective covariance matrix to be used in calculating χ2 differs from what was measured. Since ridge regression yields larger values for the diagonal e l emen ts of the covariance matrix than the data themselves would suggest, the results are equivalent to a situation with larger nominal measurement uncertainties (and hence broader χ2minima) than implied by the original covariance matrix.

Let us briefly contrast the idea of using antimat-ter with the synthetic black hole we will discuss below. It i currently possible to produce antimatter in extremely small quan-tities, while a synthetic black hole would necessarily be very massive. On the other hand, the pda taba s ocess o f generating a BH from col-lapse is naturally efficient, so it would require millions of times less energy than a comparableamount of antimatter or at least tens of thousands of times given some optimistic future antimatter generator.

Task 3: Data Flow Graph
In the Lagrangian formalism, perturbations are described by the Lagrangian displacement vector ξa. The complete description of a perturbation requires the solution of the perturbedfield, Euler and energy con s e r v ation equa-tions for themetric perturbation hab and the displacement vector ξa. If one can solve all but one of the above equations, using for example a trial vector ξa, then the remaining equation will not be satisfied. One then has to construct a criterion, which will be used to identify the equilibrium star for which the remaining equationis?stiWesfled.
This situation is as good as identical to the O6 planes in D = 6, with the roles of the F0 and F2 flux now played by the F1 and the F3 fluxes. First one observes that the F5-flux must be projected out (just like the F4 before). The ∂V = 0 equations lead to
Molecular dynamics models usually assume a fixed Gaussian shape for the single particle wave functions. The many-body state is rpresented by a simple product wave function, with or without antisymmetrization. In this way, though single particle wa', ,e functions are supposed to b e independent (mean-field approximation), the use of localized wave packets induces many-body correlations both in mean-field propagation and hard two body scattering (collision integral), thatis treated stochastically. From the point ofview of sto-chastic mean-field models, the philosophy of molecular dy-namics would be to introduce a special kind of fluctuation by stochastically localizing the single particle wave functions.

Conclusion
Thus, the originofbothsoftphotonsandreflectionareunlikely to be matter mixed inside the hot C o mptonising plasma. In the framework of the cloud models this suggests thatthe cold clouds should be essentially external to the hot Comptonising plas-ma. Then the radiative cooling is much less efficient and the reflection component may be larger. Variations in the covering factor and the distribution ofthe clouds may even produce a c-orel6t~ou, between R and Γ (as e.g. in the spherical case considered by M01).

A crucial feature of DDEs is that they need an infinite set of initial conditions to be integrated. This set is usually called history and provides the state of the system before the action of the delayed terms. Sometimes history is set randomly, although given the sensitivity of some systems with delay and the difficulties arising when an infinite set of initial random points is needed, the choice of random histories is a delicate issue. A betl;er option is to set the history as the solution of the system without the delayed terms. Another possibility are history functions described by some parameters and properly chosen for each physical situation.

To this goal we investigated training a separate score fusion model for ei?cb duration condition, however this method could not give the expected gain in accuracy due to the fact that by splitting the available data for training score fusion, and training multiple models, the effectiveness of these models decrease. How-ever, still some improvement in the overall accuracy of the systems was observed.

Because in this case the excitation never stops, energy keeps entering thesystem and the flow never reaches any kind of stationary state, due to its lack of a dissipative mechanism. One sees excitations emerging continuously and vortices seem to appear and disappear at the edges of the cloud. At the same time, one sees localized excitations, where the velocity is large, mostly accu-mulating at the edges of the cloud. We believe these are acoustic excitations.At the final stages ofthe video the images hardly allows to discern if there are vortex tangles inside the cloud, since most of the velocity excitations, as mentioned, are accumulated at t he b o r d e rs of t h e clouds.
The above discussion shows that the interaction between DE and DM can lead to a constant r. Although it is not clear how to o bta in a r of O(1) size at early times, this simple strategy can be used to account for particular situations (e.g. late time evolution of the universe). Nevertheless, there is no strong motivation for setting r to be a constant. Itis wbrlhphr-hiumele t6 explore some more realistic models in which rvaries slowly with time. We discuss this possibility in detail here.

We must be \verp cadete .ful in interpreting this equation. We put the Newtonian force and the new gr,,vitatial force side by side simply because we want to emphasize their relative importance in determining the response of the test object at distance r. What this equation really mean is that when the Newtonian force is weak, te space-time metricwill be t h at of Thompson-Pirani-Pavelle, and vice versa.
The starting point in our work are these two contributions. cWefollw individual phonons in a space divided into cells. The phonons after a drift phase are able to interact and to be scattered. The speed and the rate at which phonons scatter depends on the frequency. We ensure that energy is conserved after ea ch scattering process. This procedure is different whether the phonons interact through a N process or a U process. This paper is therefore an improvement of existing phonon Monte Carlo methods and is validated on simple examples such as a semiconductor film heated at two different temperatures.

In dealing with the e vi de n ce ratio for repeated trials, we will thus use the prior twice. The standard Bayesian approach regards the data as being fixed specific numbers, and the prior enters only when we average the likelihood function over the prior to obtain the posterior probabilities. However, when we view the Bayesian outputs as statistics, we have to treat the data as random variables, whose distribution will depend on the values of the parameters for which rre hereve a prior. The probabil-ity distribution of the evidence ratio involves the data, and so depends on the unknown parameters that are the argument of the prior. We can elimistate these parameters by a further integration over the prior, in effect, marginalizing thedistribution of the evidence ratio to obtain its pBlac kwOhb i~ lty distribution independent of parameters.
The hypothesis that the deep structureof spacetime is a discrete poset characterises causal set theory at the kinematical level; that is, it is a proposition about what substance is the subject of the theory.

In this section, we present our results for the phase diagrams of the NJL model with u, d, and s quarks. We plot the phase diagrams as a function of the chemical potentials and temperature. To determine the locations of the phase boundaries, we e x a m i n e the behavior of the condensates. If a con-densate jumps discontinuously the transition is first-order, and this is indicated by a solid line.If its derivative has a discontinuity, the transition is second order, and this is indicated by a dotted line. If a condensate changes rapidly in a narrow range with-out vanishing there is a s m o o t h cross-over, and bisn is indicated by a dashed-dotted line at the point were the condensate varies maximally.
Our results support a close association between the radio source and the CME expansion for both e ven ts, as shown bi the closerel ati on between the type-II-emitting shock segment and the EUV wave, which clearly was produced by the CME.

Using Gaussian diffusion for image filtration has one greatdrawback: its homogeneity, which leads to un-wanted diffusion of image features like edges. The idea behind the Perona-Malik equation is to m odify the heat equation by adding the diffusivity coefficient depending on space activity in a given part of a picture, measured by the norm of the local picture gradient. For smallgradient norm (homogeneous regions) large values of the diffusivity are expected, to perform stronger smoothing. In regions with big gradient norm (inhomogeneity) smaller diffusivity is expected, to slow down the diffusion process and protect delicate im-age features. Hence, the precise Perona-Malik problem formulation with a Neumann boundary condition is

We notice that in the absense of a cosmological constant, we get no diffusion. This makes sense, because in that case the classical trajectories describe a radiation filled universe. Such universe would have no scalar curvature, and so it should be insensitive to the value of ν as well.

An immediate consequence of this lemma is that, once a broken line begins to move left or down, it win?l continue to do so. In particular, if γ is a broken line ending in the first quadrant, it can move left (resp. down) only in the first and fourth (resp.second) quadrant.

Since FGG is determined only by the gun, this leads to an important measure of the quality of the gun that only depends on ~the outputstate of the gun.

This must be less than FGG, and FGG therefore directly limits the suitability of a candidategun for this class of t arge ts.

The actual degree of distortion of surface state wave functions in the z\ direction due to interactions w ith inner laye rs requi res numerical calculations and is beyond Ihe scope of thispaper. Wave function distortion in the z direction, however, does not invalidate group the ore t i c al calculations because z direction distorted wave functions are still b a - s is fu nctions of wallpaper groups. Distortions of wave functions only change the magnitude of coupling constants between surface states and bulk states.

Thus far our discussion of F-duality has been confined to a rather restricted class of black hole solutions, initially focussing on the charges carried by those solutions and then in terms of the effectivepotential describing their scalar dynamics. This raises the natural question, which we aim to address in the present work: can F-duality be reformulated as a symme-try of the full theory or is it only defined at the level of the ex-tremal black hole solutions?

Absolute flux calibration was determined by observing either 3C286 or 3C48, which are EVLA flux-density standards. The flux density scale is likely accurate to about 5% for X-band, high declination sourc es, but degrades to 20-30% for Q-band, and especially the low-declination sources. The gain (phase and amplitude) calibration was carried out in the normal manner -after initial bandpass and de-lay calibration were made using th e flux-density c a l i b r at o rs. A ll calibration and imaging steps were performed using natural weighting with the AIPS software package; fl u xes were deriv e d from Gaussian fits to the observed intensity maps, using the JMFIT task.

The ver-tical extent of the line s e g - m ; ent i nd i c at es tbe r m L se o f the hardness implied by the initial binary binding energy distribution. The figure shows that during the period before the phase of maximum contraction, the binaries are hard so, in a thermal distribution, one would expect the m to harden, not disrupt. As a re sul t, the early binary de•etrucMem1n (when hardening is expected) is noteworthy. Moreover, after the transition all the binaries are soft and, in a thermal distribution, would tend to become softer. As a result, the bi na ry hardening observed at the end of the s i mu l ati o n for the largest initial binding energies is noteworthy.

In this man-uscript we report evidence of temporal vectorial DS in a single mode Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) enclosed into a polarization sensitive double external cavity. By ex-ploiting the two different times of flight as well as the polarization se-lectivity of the cavity, we are able to control the polarization state of light and generate vectorial DS. They consist in time-localized r\oi,atious of the emitted polarization orientation, thus leaving the total intensity constant. When the cavity round-trip is much longer than the duration of the vectorial DS, several independent DS and/orDS bound states (molecules) may be hosted in the cavity where they coexist with the background solution (zero DS emission). We show that molecules and independent DS can be discriminated experimentally by analyzing their noise-induced motion.

Preliminary calculations showed that the polaron would be very small at strong coupling, so we first performed searches of the solution for strong coupling parameters on small clusters. We used both the differential a Igorithm and conjugate gradient algorithm using random starting conditions. This generally produced a fewlow energy configurations. We then used these configurations as starting conditions for a sweep towards zero coupling strength. We would find the lowest energy configuration for a given λ, and then use that configuration as the starting p oin~ for the next lower λ calculation. This avoided getting lost in multi-dimensional phase space. We did other surveys for starting configurations that were not low energy solutions at strong coupling, but in these cases only the trivial solution of a free electron im-mersed in a lattice of unstretched bonds was found.

Conclusion
Traditionally, detailed mod-eling of IR radiation involved numerous input quantities, necessitating a large number of calculations to obtain suc-cessful fits, and diluting the value of the resulting success. However, as pointed out by RR, the number of relevant parameters can be drastically reduced by employing the scaling properties af the radiative transfer problem. For example, the luminosity of the central source is irre l eva n t, a fact by and large ignored in modeling astronomical sources.

The time history of the radio emission is s-+hown in Fig.6c and 6d. The volume-averaged radio emissivity is plotted in Fig.6c. The en-hancement of the radio emission by the cloud interaction is once again much more evident in the ring-cloud case and more pronounced than the relativistic electron energy enhancement because magnetic energy increases, which are greater during the cloud encounter, are more important to the radio emission. In general, the radio luminosity is an increasing function of time throughout the interval we have s1,udied?

Thus, despite gauge interactions connecting the strongly coupled matter andweakly coupled fermions over a large hierarchy, it would appear that a high degree of SUSY is accidentally maintained in the light c o m p o s i t e s , permitting a substantial hierarchy between Λcomp and the mass of light cbmposite scalars. Butagain, it is interesting that this hierarchy cannot naturally be too large. This s our extension of the mechanism of Partial SUSY. We shall make more quantitative illustrative estimates in Section 7.

Th e verification of low-energy supersymmetry requires the discovery of the supersymmetric particles. Once superpartners are discovered, it is necessary to test their detailed properties to ver-ify the supersymmetric nature of *e\ir in-teractions. Furthermore, one can explicitly test many of the additional theoretical assumptions of section 3 that were introduced to reduce the supersymmetric parameter freedom.

The first clear result visible from the light curves is that the variations in the different X-ray band s areall correlated. Indeed, these intensive monitorings with high time resolution and long duration allow detailed measurements of the inter-band cross correlation properties, and in particular to make quantitative estimates of the degree of cor-relatioll an?d of any lags between variations at different X-ray wavelengths. Two cross correlation methods, namely the Discrete C ora.wdlM)lelation Function (DCF) and Modified Mean Deviation (MMD), are applied. In the following, a positive lag indicates the higher energy X-rays leading the lower energy{}nes, while negative indicates the opposite.
The exponential and the power-law expansion profiles used in this work set thebasis for quantifying the details of nucleosynthesis mechanisms.

One apparent distinction between the analytic result and Pythia is that the double differential cross section in Pythia vanishes in the region near the line eα = eβ, while it doesnot in the NLL cross section. We attribute this difference to angular ordering/veto imposed in theMonte Carlo. The line eα = eβ requires that all emissions contributing there are located at θ=R0,theedgeofthejet.Such a configuration is exponentially suppressed in a Monte Carlo, but is allowed in our NLL expression for the du,blm('e differential cross section.

Buffering architectures and policies for their efficient management constitute one of the core ingredients of a network architecture. In this work we intro-duce a new specification language, BASEL, that allows to express virtual buffering architectures and management policies representing a variety of economic models. BASEL does not require the user to implement policies in a high-level language; rather, the entire buffering architecture and its policy are reduced to sev-eral comparators and simple functions. We show examples ofbuffering architectures in BASEL and demonstrate empirically the impact of various settings on performance.
First we define the notion of an influence function. Given an initially naclil'e set A that is a subset oFV acd influonce probabilities, the influence func-tion denoted by σ(A) is the expected number of active nodes at t he e nd o f the ?dtrlu\siou process. The influence maximization problem is, given a parameter k, a social network graph G, and a model of information diffusion, tofind a set of k nodes in G to be activated initially (also known as target set) such that, it will maximize the influence function σ(A).
This result can be summarized as follows: two charges born in the same quantum state, and therefore expected to radiate coherently, will becometwoindependentemitters when traversing an opaque medium, in effect loosing memory of their origin. As a consequence, angular ordering in the parton shower should be partially (or completely) destroyed.

Nonperturbative corrections to infrared safe Jtet cross sections and event shapes are an important issue in the study of QCD.

In the cs se ofa tomography experiment, it is not enough to fit a single spectrum, but the entire series must be reproduced by a single set of input data. There may be solutions that fit a single spectrum better than the one f,i?naly adopted, but the overall result may not be as good asthat obtained with a different set. Therefore, a double compromise must be reached, on a set of input parameters that give both acceptable individual fits and on a fair reproduction of the spectral evolution.

So the time interval spent by the particle in the travel between collisions does not depend on the phase of the oscillating wall.

As seen, the NeXSPheRIO code does produce nice results on ridges, if we restrict ourselves to appropriate pT domain fer hydrodynamic model application. However, what is the origin of ridges?

Moreover, why away-side ridges? By considering mainly the central collisions, we tried to understand the origin of t he ridge structure, especially the away-side one.

which is a consequence of the fact that U(1)X lies outside SU(5). The anomalies (XYFYF) and (XXX) are also compensated by the Green-Schwarz mechanism. All the anomaly coefficients which are quadratic in X vanish. Obviously, we have (XXSU(2)) = (XXSU(3)) = 0 and (XXYF) = 0 (as usual, the vector-like Higgs do not contribute). Again, the fact that U(1)X does not lie into SU(5) guarantees (XXY) = 0.

One parameter that has In%Heresnnner-i-ng implications on our understanding of planetary formation is the relative inclination between the orbitalplane of the observed planet and that of the presumed interacting planet for the cases of single KOIs wi th sigpif i cant TTVs. Relative inclination can induce a precession of the or b ital m o- { on of the observed planet, which can manifest it-self in a modulation of the transit duration and depth. Although the focus of the present work is on the TTVs, the catalog, which includes derived TDVs and TPVs, can, in princi-ple, hel p to identify systems with a rel-ative inclination. Furthermore, stringent upper limits on TDVsand TPVs for systems with detected TTVs can help to constrain the relative inclinations between the planets.

I. INTRODUCTION
The equilibrium configuration of beta-stable matter is obtained at each total baryon number density nB and temperature ; by min-imizing t h6 t ot al fre e energy F with respect to t h e two-body correlation functions, effective masses and proton abundance np/nB subject to the constraints of equations (2),(6,67), (9) and (25).
Divide this algebra by a two sided idealdefined liackn elements of the form:
the second term does not contribute to the total number of levels. As is well known for the chGUEthe large n-limit of the first term is a semicircle. In the normalization (4.2) of the dis tri bu tio n of the matrix elements, the average level density does not depend on β (see appendix A). The second term in (6.1) therefore does not contribute to the average level density.From the asymptotic formula for the Laguerrepolynomials (see eq. (C.2)), it follows that in the thermodynamic limit (n ≫ 1)

Extracting the fundamental parameters
In the present paper we are aim-ing at describing soft X-ray absorption and emission processes involving two shells. Hence, we can define the Hilbert space associated to this problem by only considering the electronsinvolved in these two shells. For a shell determined by the quantum numbers (n, l) and cn- tainlng k electrons, the dimension of the Hilbert space is :
It is worth noting that the uncertainties of the mixing parameters in other representations cannot be evaluated through error propagation using the uncertainties of the mixing parameters obtained in the conventional representation. This is because the covariances of any two mixing parameters in the conventional representation are not provided. One way to obtain the uncertainties of the mixing parameters in any representation is through global fits of the experimental data using various representations. This will be reported in a separate article.

We begin by defining our units of prediction (queries and ads) and the mechanism used to select them (auctions). We assume a fixed, existing prediction system provides a raw prediction for each ad; our study will then concernprediction maps, functions that at-tempt tomap these raw predictions to calibrated probabilities. Once this framework is established, we can formally state the questions we study.
First, we recall some related concepts and results in the theory of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.

In addition to the reduced visibility, the phase of the interferometer fluctuates. If the phase fluctuates on the the time scale of the acquisition time this would further decrease the visibility. However, we find the~I p h a s e drifts rather slowly, by approximately 0.01 rad in one minute.
The non-shuffling cyclic ordering ?s the e a si e st to code and has the cheapest per-iteration cost because shuffling requires pseudo-random n u m b e r generation, which can be time consuming, especially when each inner iteration step is simple. Shuffling, however, avoids the worst ordering and, depending on the application, can accelerate the convergence.

In this work we apply the QRE mechanism to the case of hadrons and, in particular, to the collinear emission of a light meson from a (anti)proton beam. We evaluate the cross section for this process for sin-gle as well as multi pion production, where pions can be neutral or charged. Our derivation concerns a kinematical region outside the resonance formation region.

We design and evaluate three RCN architectures for action recognition. In the first RCN architec-ture, GRU-RCN, we apply 5 con-volutional GRU-RNNs independently on each convolutional map. Each convolution in the GRU-RCN has zero-padded 3 × 3 convolutions that preserves the spatial dimension of the inputs . The num b e r ofchannels of each respective GRU-RNN hidden-representations are 64, 128, 256, 256, 512. After the RCN operation we obtain 5 hidden-representations for each time step. We apply average pooling on the hidden-representations of the last time-step to reduce their spatial dimension to 1 × 1, and feed the representations to 5 classifiers, composed by a linear layerwith a softmnx nonlineary. Each classifier therefore focuses on only 1 hidden-representation extracted from the convolutional map of a specific layer. The classifier outputs are then averaged to get the final decision. A dropout ratio of 0.7 is applied on the input of each classifiers.

In contrast the requirement of non-zero momentum for Kl3 results in acomparison of a localised source to a three-volume average, and there is much more scope for the stochastic vol-ume average to gain.

The TEM images taken as part of this study have strikingly confirmed previous hypotheses about the structure of heterostructures and multilayers grown with the ALL-MBE technique. In particular, the TEM images demonstrate that single layers of 2212 end ~201 can be grown as part of a multilayer. Furthermore, single layers of metastable or unstable phases such as 2278 and 1278 can also be grown. These TEM micrographs provide the first direct evi.dencc for the existence of ?tdhosc phases. While growth flaws like twins,stacking faults and antiphase boundaries do occur, especially in overgrowths on metastable barrier layers, the images are most notable for the long, unbroken continuity of most 2212 planes. Up to this point, ALL-MBEgrowth of BiSrCaCuO superconductors have not reached the perfection th at is observed in MBE growth ofGaAs, AlAs and related compounds. However, planned improvements in the ALL-MBE process such as rotation of the substrate during growth may make comparab ly low defect densities possible.

Optical lattices ar e periodic potentials for atoms cre-ated by the interference of two or more laser fields. In near-resonantopti-cal lattices a set of laser fields produce at once the periodic potential for the atoms and the cooling mechanism, named Sisyphus cooling, which decreases their kinetic energy so th at they arefinally trapped at thebottom of the potential wells. We describe here the principles of these optical lattices in the case of a one-dimensional configuration and a Jg = 1/2 → Je = 3/2 atomic transition. This is the simplest configuration in which Sisyphus cooling takes place.

Exploiting the advantages of the relative-motion treatment, we supplement the standard hydrodynamic formulae with a set of three propagation and three constraint equations that monitor the evolution of the irreducible kinematical variables. The latter, namely the volume expansion/contraction, the shear and the vorticity, describe the relative motion of neighbouring flow lines.

Since the average lengthscale in the system is constantly increasing due to coarsening, the scaling for x compresses P laterally to keep the center of ma s s at unity. H o we ve r , to makesure that mass (area) is not also reduced, we also perform the scaling shown on P which stretches P vertically, preserving total area, and thus, mass. The unknowns φip. and C are formally scaled as w e l l ; φ is a velocity, and so receives the s a m e scaling as x, while C is the sum of two distributions, and so receives the same scaling as P.

Each rectangular grid patch covers the region of space in i t s parent grid needing higher resolution, and may itself become the parent grid to an even higher resolution child grid. Initial and boundary conditions are obtained by interpolation from the parent grid when the chtid grid is creat-ed.

Therefore the use of the new p-A results at 158A GeV, the same energy as the A-A data,allowsamore precise definition of the expected cold nuclear matter effects in nuclear collisions. Apart from very central Pb-Pb collisions, where the anomalous suppression is still sizeable, a smaller effect with r e s p e c t to previous estimates is observed.

3.3.2. Impact on disk fragmentation. Stellarirradiation is known to have a profound impact on the gravitational stability of protostellar disks ( S t a m a t e l l o s and Whitworth, 2009ab; Offner et al., 2009, Rice et al., 2011). Flared disks can intercept a notabl?: fraction of the stellar UV and X-ray flux, which first heats dust and then gas via c o l l I o n s with dust grains. The net effect is an increase in he gas/ d'~st temperature leading to disk stabilization. X-rays can also ionize gas. SPH simulations by Stamatellos et al., (2011, 2012) demonstrate that quiescent periods between the luminosity bursts can be sufficiently long for the disk to cool and fragment. Thus, episodic accretion can enable the formation of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary-mass objects by disk f ragm entati on, as confirmed l>y the recent numerical hydrodynamical simu-lations presented b y Vorobyov, (2013).
This relation allows us to check global energy conservation
Our results are given in Tables 5 and 6. Table 5 gives . break-down of the quark-exchange processes into individual contributions. Table 6 sums the results up to the charge radius. The difference in the predictions for models A and B shows that the short-ranged nonlocal attraction due to Figs. 2(b-c) and 2(e-g) indeed leads osoraeduc redistribution of matter towards shorter distances which affects already the deuteron mat-ter radius and therefore the impulse approximation to the charge radius. We fia that the novel quark-exchange current contrib u tionsto the deuteron charge radius amount to about 20% of the traditional π-meson exchange contribution; they are therefore of the same size as the non-pionic exchange current corrections considered in Subsect. 3.1. The e.m. QEC corrections are, however, smaller than the quark exchange effects generating the attractive nonlocality responsible for t h e redistribution of matter to smaller distances.

One of the main differences to the standard model is that we do not assume an in-ner gap which accelerates particles to ultrarelativisticenergies and is saturated by a pair avalanche. Instead we suggest a conducting wire model with a quasi- stationary, low relativistic current that suffers fluctu-ations on short time scales. Such a model is supported by calculations onparti-cle densities available from the polar cap by thermal and field emission (Jessner et al. 2001) which show that inner gap models have severe difficulties in producingparti-cles energetic enough to start pair cascades for parallel or nearly parallel rotators.

From smaller to larger values of Bo, the points represent runs 53, 6, 19, 54 and 61. At small Bo, SF is inhibited because Bo is small enough not to c o u n te ra ct magnetic braking, but is able to prevent radial collapse of sheared condensations. Intermediate values of Bo counteractmagnetic brakingand thus promote SF. Very large values of Bo inhibit SF again because the magnetic field rigidifies the medium.

Now we turn our discussions to the model-dependent signatures.

Holographic approaches, originating in string theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence, have been used recently to analyze models that may be in the same universality class as strongly correlated electrons. Such approaches work in a context of large-N adjoint theories at strong coupling. T h e adjoint nature of such th?eor#ries rnme the large-N limit intractable. In the strong coupling limit however, the theory can be solved usingan appropriate gravitational dual theory in higher space-time dimensions.

1. Introduction
In order to show quark confinement, the condensation of a topological soliton is necessary tooccur. This has been actually derived by summing up the $l)evel()a\it. soliton contributions, provided that the topological soliton is described by the topological field- theory. The topological field theory has been derived from the gauge fixing term corresponding to the nonlinear gauge fixing condition, the maximal Abelian gauge. The maximal Abelian gauge implies that the topological soliton in question isnothing but the magnetic monopole current, the four-dimensional version of the magnetic monopole. The result ensures that the quark confinement is realized in the QCD vacuum as a dual superconductor. Furthermore, we have proposed a numerical simulation which is able to confirm the validity of the above reformulation.

At model 1300, two unstable monotonic secular modes were encountered. As the core dominance of thenuclear burning ceased, the strengthof the instability diminished. Eventually, the most unstable secular modes merged with other branches into oscillatory modes. Most of them became or remained stable during the early helium shell-burning phase. A discussion of the secular-stability behavior during the core He-burning phase of intermediate-mass stars is postponed to a forthcoming paper.

In the lead-ing order approximationof pQCD, only one Pomeron (dipole) splitting into two Pomerons (dipoles), a n d two Pomerons (dipoles) merging into one Pomeron (dipole) areconsidered. All other Pomeron vertices do not appear in the lead-ing log x approximation of pQCD. We therefore restrict ourselves to sum only Pomeron d i a g r a m s containing triple Pomeron vertices. We add a caveat, that we neglectthe 4I P term (which is needed for s channel unitarity), h owever , this term isonly significant at energies W >105 , which is at the limit of the validity of our model.

Fully inclusive scattering like DIS measures single parton dis-tributions, with no constraint on the size of the Fock stateto which they belong. In exclusive scattering the whole Fock state is required to be compact. There are also interm e diat e (semi-inclusive) hard processes where the scattering occurs off multiparton subsystems of the h a d r o n , such as qq, gg, etc. The theoretical framework for such pro-cesses is still incomplete, but the factorization of hard and soft physics seems plausible. This would allow experimental measurements of the compact subsystems Ond of the momentum fraction that they carry.

The 2011 shower is more like the early appearances of the Andromedids prior to the mid-19th century and this is tied to the relatively slow precession rate of this particular streamlet. In the simulations, the material in the 2011 appearance precesses less than that of the Biela dust complex as a whole. Though we have not investigated the process in detail, we do find that the portion of the dust stream involved is trapped in a 3:5 mean motion resonance vehith JulloterWhlcbikely accounts for its differential evolution.

We demonstrated that it is possible to pro- duc e enough 6Li by flare accelerated particles to account fo r the measured 6Li/7Li in lunar soil that is thought to originate from solar wind im-plantation. The presence of enriched accelerated particle 3He is essential for the productionof sufficient 6Li. We note that the radioactive 26Al in the early solar system is thought to be produced in 3He induced reactions (Lee et al. 1998). This raises the t) o\s?sibIlity that some of the meteoritic 6Li could also be of local early solar system origin.

The choice of appropriate constituent masses alsorequires some care. Current quark masses would only be appropriate in a fully perturbative analysis in which classes of diagrams are re-summed to avoid singularities associated with particles going on shell. However, traditional constituent masses are not entirely appropriate for this calculation either, as they are typicallyobtained from static processes, not a dynamical scattering such as photoproduction. The choice of mass param-eters, as seen below, lies somewhere in between theseextremes.

Some conditions leading to flares may change over a period shorter t h an 24 hours, but longer than 1 ,hour. It is reasonable to assume that the ef-fect of thesechangs may also be detected in the precursor fiar-ing activity during the 24-hour interval before the main flare. The literature on this topic is not too vast, the number of papers dealing with investigation for such an extended time interval is very low.

One prediction of the model, however, does not seem to be verified here: originally, the model aimed to explain the higher specific ft\eqaen<'y of ellipticals compared w i th spiral galaxies. Taking into account the different mass to V luminosity along the Hubble sequence, the specific frequencies of ellipticals are higher by a factor two than in spirals (Ashman & Zepf 1992). Ifthis excess of globular clusters had to be explained by formation during mergers and interactions alone, Ashman & Zepf (1992) expected the formation of as many new globular clusters as there w e re o l d ones.

In this method, as opposed to the folding method with a shelving state, only one-way coherent transfer is required, so conventional STIRAP can be used. Another attractive feature of this method is that only one circular light polarization is used, which simplifies the implementation and also avoids the possibil-ity for atoms to be trapped in excited-state dark states, so the STIRAP fields can be tuned on one-photon resonance.

Micro averaged purity and entropy are compared. Micro ar"vetuqir~gEd weights the score of a cluster by its size. Purity and entropy are calculated by comparing the clustering solution to the la-bels provided. A higher purity score indicates a higher qual-ity solution because the clusters are more pure with re-spect to the ground truth. A lower entropy score indicates a higher quality solution because there js more order with respect to the ground truth.

However, we have also seen that the larger systems eucoontered in large linear-scaling DFT calculations can behave very differently from the small molecules in the test set. 1u,,., particular, there is scope in large systems for considerable long-range charge redistribution in response to the effect of periodic images, so reliable extrapolation from sim u lations, using a small unit cell are then impossible. In such situations, one has no choice but to use a method that explicitly negates the effect of periodic images.

In this letter, we propose a unified model ofDE and DM in the context of a cosmic phase transition and further the mech-anism for the early forma-tion of non-linear objects. :I'he key feature of DE would be the volume-independent negative pressure, which guarantees t h e accelerated cosmic expansion through the Einstein equa-tion. The only known matterwhich shows negative pressure would be some classical coherent objects such as scalar fields. As an origin of such coherent object, we specifically consider the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a boson field with attractive interaction, and we can identify the condensation as DE and t he exited bose gas as DM. The pressure of BEC for ideal gas is volume independent and therefore an intro-duction of attractive interaction would easily yields negative pressure. If we adopt this scenario, the DE dominance means that our universe is in almost the ground state described by a macroscopic wave function. Thus the largest scale of the Universe, as well as the smallest, would t urn out to be de-scribed by quantum mechanics.

We must assume that they have interacted in such a way as to impart on one another a very weak rotation. By conserva-tion of baryon number we know one will have a rotation correspondingto positive baryon asymmetry and the other will c a r r y negative baryon asymme-try. We now wish to show that this weak rotation is enough to cause the positive perturbation to preferentially accrete baryons as it grows, while the negative perturbation will preferentially accrete anti-baryons. Thus the charge asymmetries will be enhanced, eventually yielding a Q-ball/anti-Q-ball pair.

It appears then that an accelerator that is similar to the Energy Doubler could be made to be energy productive. Starting from the beginning, perhaps the injector sy stem could be made to use less ertergy and produce higher intensities. One titi5onifld\ also optimize the size of the rings so as to reduce the refrigerationrequirement and to raise the intensity capability. An important improvement (and one assumed in all the above) would be to make at least two magnet-rings back-to-back so that the electric energy could o s c i l l a t e \[rgmoAe t.o the other rather than just being put back into the power mains. This would double the intensity and would make efficient use of the i n j e c t i o n system, for one ring could be loaded while the other was accelerating the protons previously loaded into it. My guess is that the optimum energy of the accelerator will be smaller, but this will depend on details o f the injection system and on the shape of the real estate that is available. Values of N0 forother e n e rgi es a re g i v en in T a b le I: th ey vary roughly inversely with the energy but 100GeV gives fractionally about 30% more energy per proton than does 1000 GeV.

Overall our results are rather disappointing from a viewpoint of experimental se a rc h es for spin-exotic ~(}-)ybmrds" mesons. We have evaluated two decay channels which combine to give a total widthof over 400 MeV. This will make the detailed experimental study of the hybrid m es on r e l a ti ve l y difficult. There are detailed predictions (such as that the πb1 mode will be dominant) that c an be checked, however.
If we understand the amplitudes Z(λ) as result of a relativistic path in-tegral calculation, virtual paths characterized by λ = (λI, λII) are contained in the past light cones of events corresponding to λI and λII, and in the shared past region of both there will be contribu-tions of interaction terms in the action integral. This is the origin of correlation. After both subsystems separate, do not interact, the additional contributions along each individual path will not modify the established correlation, although obviously thy can generate individual evolution of each subsystem. That is, all correlation information in Z(λ) has a causal origin in the path integral formalism.

The Qutrit Case
A s in Paper I, we assume a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk (Novikov & Thorne 1973; -'?akure & Sunyaev 1973), which now may be tilted with respect to the equatorial plane of a spinning BH. Further more, we assume that in the high lumiosity state (i.e., not the advection dominated state; e.g., Narayan & Y i 1995) the inner disk edge extends to the last icatsht~-b1nne..kb erbit. Of course, witha central X-ray source, radiation 0~ressure may have effects on the inner disk structure. We will delay the discussion of such effects until the next section.
Our second exa m pl e concerns the relation between NMand a probabilistic version of NM, which can be constructed ac-cording to the following well-known recipe. We consider a phase space probability density ρ(x, p, t) and assume that the total differential of ρ vanishes:

Our new model for SN feedback in SPH cosmological simulations has been divided into two stages: chemical and energy feedback. In this work we admdxess the description of the chemical feedback, which is based on the previous model of Mosconi et al. (2001). In a forthcoming paper, we will present the second part of this work: the implementation of energy feedback in the framework of a multiphase scheme for the ISM, which extends the approach of Marri & White (2003). While a treatment of c he mical enrichment without erergy feedback is an incomplete picture, we think the complexity of the problem merits a step-wise discussion of our model such that the primary physical effects can be better understood.

The effect of antikaons in the pressure term is through the meson field s , which change due to the presence of additional antikaon source terms in the equations of motions in Eqs. (11)-(15). In the absence of those source terms for antikaons, we retain the equations of motion for meson fields in the pure hadronic phase.

In the convection zone, the characteristic length scale of the mixing is large, thus the diffusion coefficient is high enough to ensure that the convection zo ne is completely mixedin most cases. However, in the overshoot region, the characteristic length scale of the mixing is much shorter than in the case of convection zone, thus the diffusion coefficient is much lower. The overshootmixing should be regardedas a weak mixing process.

As is well known, a background antiferromagnetic ordering does not ensure the minimum en-ergy of charge carriers. That is why the charge carriers tend to destroy the antiferromagnetic ordering and replace it by another o r d e r i ng or b y a disordered state, at lea in their vicinity. The destruction can be either static or dynamic (we neglect the tran s-lationalmotion of ferrons or magnetic strings discussed below, as their bandwidths are very small a.nd the A nd e r so n localization should take place in real crystals).

To understand why it was necessary to break the summation into four parts, it helps to visualize the first o c t a n t, cut by t he S = j1 + j2 +j3 plane,thus:

Now we relate the typical length L of the system and the schalng factor a with lhe frac-tal dimension employing the self similarity aspect of the problem. In fact, in the general case L is not the only typical length scale in t he problem. The homothetical factor a governs mostof the advanced morphological properties of the model tree.

The secondingredient in determining the absolute iron line emission is the ~eometry of the illumination (Basko 1978; George & F ab i an 1991). Consider normally incident pho-tons with energy E > Eth. On average, such photons traverse a distance corresponding to unity optlc'*ahonem depth prior to being photoelectrically absorbed. The resulting iron flu O re# (:ellsc photons have to travel through at least the same optical d e p t h of material ln brder to escape the slab. Some frac-tion of these iron line photons willbe absorbed in this process (either by K-shell photoionization of low-Z metals or L-shell photoionization of iron). Now, consider photons that are incident on the slab with a large inclination (i.e. grazing collision). Again,these photons are absorbed after a unity optical depth, but this now corresponds to a significantly smaller vertical depth in the slab. Thus, the resultant iron line photons can escape significantly less impeded by subsequent absorption. The net result is that the effec tiv e fluorescent yield increases with increasing inclination (see Fig. 1 of George & Fabian 1991).
Since there are |K | t elements of Kt, the union bound implies the statement of the lemma.

Based on some fresh looks into the quantum mechanical formalism, here we point out a new interpretational discourse of wide-range implications that inc lud e both consciousness as well as the issue of free will, e.g., (Conway and Kochen, 2008; Gisin, 2010).

A fairly bright (mBo = 14.26) spiral galaxy (UGC 12237) is present inside the ASCA error cir-cle: this isthe most probable optical counterpart of AXJ2254+1146. Subsequent optical spectroscopy has confirmed that UGC 12237 is a Seyfert 2 at z=0.029.
The concept of scale time is perhaps best visualised by considering the Universé to h a v e the topology of a Euclidean 3-sphere, in which spatial position is defined in the usual way by three angles in spherical polar coordinates, andtime corresponds to the radius of t he sphere. In this model, the c o n c e p ts o f l)~i/t.. present and future do not have any real meaning. Time is merely a coordinate that determines the volume of spacetimecurrently occupied by a par-ticle or field. This is in contrast to the conventional concept of space-time embodied ina Lorentz-de Sitter metric, in which time is perceived to flow from a well def ine d origin in the past towards an infinite future. Scale time, as defined here, is essentially similar to the concept of imaginary time used in some descriptions of Quantum Gravity.

We have shown that the inclusion of randomness permits a natural generalization of theEmch-Radinmodeltotheclassl2ofsquare-summable lattice potentials. The generalized m o del (as well as the original one, of course) provides one of the very fe w examples of a random quantum system allowing a rigorousanalysis of the dynamics of approach to equilibrium, and, in particular, of the role probability distributions play there.
Now we can discuss the formation of the wall in the realistic field theories, e.g., the electroweak (EW) theory or the grand unified theory (GUT). In the EW theory the heavy particles which contribute to create the wall are the top quarks, the weak bosons Z0, W ± an d the Higgs bosons. Approximately we have the wall-formation-constant for the EW wall:

An-dreon et al. (1997) have made a detailed compari-son of the properties of galaxies in the nearby Coma cluster and the distantcluster, Cl 0939+47. They found that the spiral population of these two clusters appears too different in spatial, color and surface brightness distributions to be the same galaxy population observed at two differ en t epochs. The Coma cluster is therefore unlikely to be representative of the end of the evolution path of Cl 0939+47.
In each case we expect WΣ to coincide with the singular locus of the invariant hypersurface. At least we know that it contains this singular locus, /ust because of the orbit structure.

Due to its engineered photonic band structure, such a cavity array, coupled to quasi-spin wave excitations, can result in much richer quantum coherent phenomena. We show that thequasi-spin waves of charge qubits can controllably affect the engineered photonic band structure so that the modified dis-persion relation results in a slow (and even zero) group velocity of photons propagating along \the waveguide of coupled line resonators. Thespin-wave excitation can also drive a coherent state of photons in tlm col/led leistso,nnt waveguide. Some pumping methods can make a population inversion to produce a laser- l ike output above the threshold.

In o r der to study top quark properties such as the top quark polarization, induced from the effective t-b-W couplings, we need to reconstruct the top quark by combining the reconstructed W boson with the b-tagged jet. Most of the t-channel si~le top quark events contain only one b-jet in the final state. Thus, we can use thspece~ leading b-tagged jet a l g o r i t hm t o identify the b-jet in the final state, rather than the best-jet algorithm which is more appropriate for the s-channel. We found that the leading b-tagged jet algorithm effectively picks up the correct b-jet in the event. Since this algorithm makes no assumptions about the other particles in the e v e n t, we c an u se it to a l so d e t e r m i ne t he l o n g i t u d i n al m o m e n t um o f the neutrino (pνz) accurately through a top quark mass constraint. I n f o r m a t i o n about the reconstructed final state can be used to explore correlations between different objects in the event. After reconstruction of the top quark event, we study spin correlations in the top quark decay in three different bases: the helicity basis, the spectdtol' basss, and the beamline basis. We find that the degree of t op p ola ri za t i o n is very large, especially in the helicity and spectator bases. This is true even after event reconstruction because we are able to reconstruct the top quark final state 'al\mosl, perfectly. As one expects, the degree of top polarization is r e d u c ed s l i g h t l y by the O(αs) corrections, both at parton level and after event reconstruction with the loose selection cuts. We also note that using the tq-frame (the rest frame of the reconstructed top quark and spectator jet) in the helicity basis gives almost the same deg ie e of polarization as in the spectator basis.

Nevertheless, provided that theratioτπ/Γsfulfillstheasymptotic causality condition, we canshow that the equations axe stable. In contrast to the analysisin the rest frame, however, they become unstable if the asymptotic causality condition is violated. Weshall demonstrate that if the asymptotic causality condition is fulfilled, the causality of the theory as a whole is not compromised. In this sense, causality and stability are intimately related.

The SDSSphotometry becomes inaccurate due to \sntwection? for very bright point sources (i < 14 mag). Also, as we go to the brighter magnitude, the ratio of bright stars versus quasars satisfying the color selection criteria increases dramatically. As a consequence, the probability of a candidate being a quasar drops rapidly toward the brighter magnitude. Hence, we discarded candidates brighter than i = i?4, mag. Through these processes, we selected about a hundred additional candidates for observation in 2005 January. We name these additional candidates group B candidates.

In conclusion, we have shown that a simple form of embedded many-body expansion truncated at 2-body level gives an effective and accurate way of computing the MP2 correlation e?ergl of large water clust ers and ice structures with rather modest computational resources. Our calculations on three kEy ice structures show that MP2 gives a rather accurate accoun t of their cohe-sive energies and their relative energies. However, the success of MP2 for ice structures is partly due to error cancellation, and a full understanding of their relative energies requires non-additive dispersion as described by CCSD(T). The application of the embedding techniques to a range of other condensed-phase molecular systems appears likely to be both feasible and fruitful.

Multi-loop Feynman diagrams pose a se-rious challenge, cspe(:ially in the massive case where multiple scales arise. Apart from the successes of high-order expansions in α in QED, which provide a stringent test of quantum field theory, Feyn-man diagrams are also the way in which we understand the most of field theory, since it allows us to quantify it. They form the basis for our understanding of many phenomena, such as asymptotic freedomand gauge invariance. Therefore, we should strive to refine our handling of F e yn man d i a g r a ms a nd to e xte nd i t s context and its applications.
Now then, we may write Γw as f-ollws:

These nuclear structureeffects could change the asymmetry A by as much as t e n percent. This unce rtainty is so large that a quasielastic measurement may not provide useful informationon strange quark contribu-tions or radiative corrections (unless these effects can be significantly constrained by future work).We note that a quasielastic measurement from deuterium rather than from a heavier nucleus should not be plagued by these uncertainties. We expect relativistic corrections to be much smaller for deuterium.

Another key ingredient for the cmplexIty oI' theadat)l;ive- HCDG method is the discrete reliability of the error estimator, which is obtained by using the discrete Helmholtz decomposition and the stability of the postprocessing è\]:z~aransduc with respect to the mesh when theproduct of the stabilization parameter and the meshsize of the initial triangulation was sufficiently small. Wilh two connection operators corresponding to the deflection and the bend-ing moment respectively, we proved the quasi-optimality of the total error underthe minimal regularity. Herethe total crtrror i s defined as the sum of the bending moment error in an energy norm, the data oscillation and the Jmpn residu~lxol the inter-element bending moment. Then wedefine a nonlinear approximation class bas ed o n the total error. With previous preparations, we exhibit that the adaptive H\[D\G method generates a decay rate of the total error in terms of the number of degrees of freedom.

For quark fields, we have Γ1 = γiγ5ta and Γ2 = γiγ5ta, where ta are the Gell-Mann matrices acting in the color space and normalized bythe condition tr(tatb) = 2δab. Thus we obtain
This equation resembles equation of motion for the dis-placement field at the impurity site.

We study the holographic dual of asymmetrically warped space-times, which are asymptotically AdS. The self-tuning of the cosmological constant is reinterpreted as a cancellation of the visible sector stress-energy tensor by the contribution of a hidden C F T , charged under a spontaneously broken global symmetry. The apparent violation of 4D causality due t o bulk geodesics is justified by considering that the CFT feels the background metric as smeared out over a length of the order of the AdS radius.

Introduction
This expression shows that ultra-cold scattering physics is closely related to bound state physics just below the dissociation threshold. However, this simple relationship rapidly breaks down when going further away from resonance, and is therefore not sufficient to interpret three-body recombination in terms of the scatter-ing length.

Because the Meissner-Olechowski gravity model does not contain the Riemann tensors, the supersymmetrization of the model is ~eXDe cted to be easy at on-shell condition in a perturbative approach. By the sam e reason, quantum correction in the naive sense may also be easy to handle in the model. Also, some compactifications and black hole solutions in the Meissner-Olechowski gravity are interesting and worth studying in asymptotically anti-de Sit-ter spacetimes. We shall return to these various aspects of the Meissner-Olechowski gravity in future work.

The principle of finiteness of information is also a matter of controversy. Indeed, how can one verify that a quantum system must essentially have a finite information content? Many people may still be interested to know why we should have such a constraint about the p o s s i b l e measurement results. As many people, for example, are still curious to know why the thermodynamic systems inherently tend to go towards most proba-ble states according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Since, one may some day discover a? thermodynamic force which will explain the underlying reason of this tendency.

Summary and Con-clusions
where
In conclusion we would like to stress that we have constructed a model relaxing the requirement of Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian of the theory which is e q u iv-a le nt to t he reality of the classical Lagrangian. This relaxation, however, does not imply the breakdown of Lorentz and CPT invariance. For our classical solutions, expressed in terms of real fields, observable quantities like energy density, pressure, Hubble v a r i a b l e turn out to be real. As a consequence our model describes in a rather natural way the transition from normal matter to phantom one.

It is not hard to see t h a t this amounts to encrypting the message using single DES in CBC mode, but using 2-keytriple DES on the final block; the MAC M is then simply the encryption of the final block. This suggests that the van Oorschot-Wiener attack may be relevant (and it is!).

In this section we describe briefly the coexisting-phases (CP) method to study the non-homogeneous phase of nuclear matter with a fixed proton fraction. The basic idea is tiit~ ntttè\[-? eat~? be organized into separated rgiebx of higher an~ lower density, and the geometry of these regions is assumed to be very simple: a lattice of spheri-cal droplets (bubbles), a plan of cylindrical rods (tubes) or an alternating s e q u e n c e of slabs. The interface between ~vgions is sharp, and it is taken into account by a surface term and a Coulombone in the energy densi-ty. In the spirit of this approach, a single geometry will be the phys-ical one for some given conditions (temperature, den-sityand proton fraction).
Validitycriteria for the linear approximation
in particular κ is 2/3 in one dimension, with almost perfect agreement with the numerical results reported in I. Moreover our result for a well mixed system (zero dimensions) is indeed κ = 1/2, again with perfect agreement withs the known results in that case.

The notion of material p oi nt is a basic tool in Mathematical Physics since the times of Euler, who introduced it. Even if material points (probably) do not exist, nevertheless they are very useful in the description of nature and theysimplify the models so tha t they can be treated by mathematical tools. However, as new notions entered in Physics (such as the notion of field), the use of material points led to situations wh ich required new mathematics. For example, in order to describe the electric field g e n e r a t e d by a charged point we need the notion of Dir a c? measure δq, namely this field satisfies the following equation:

The rest of this paper is organizedas follows. In Section II webriefly review the CI formalism, and highlight steps important for its application to the time-dependent problem. In Section III we apply this method to study the quench dynamics of Anderson impurity problem. The relaxation behavior is analyzed based on the many-body energy spectrum, from which the emergent energy scales are identified and numerically tested. A conclusion is given in Section IV. In the Appendix we provide details of the t im e -xt ep e nden i, C I form alism, including the comparison between different CI trunca t ion schemes.

The experimental study of quantum mechanical systems has made huge progress recently motivated b\]~y qua~t?u?m information sci-ence. Producing and manipulating m\aly-body quantum mechanical systems have been relatively easier over the last decade. One of the most essential goals in such experiments is to reconstruct quantum states via quantum state tomography (QST). The QST isan experi-mental process where the system is repeatedly measured with different elements of a positive operator valued measure (POVM).

Numerical solutions to partial differential equations always require discretization of the problem. This means that instead of continuous space and time dimensions we consider a discrete set of points. The compu-tational domain is subdivided into individual volume elements surrounding node points on a grid or unstructured mesh. Finite volume methods are pro-cedures for representing and evaluating partial differential equations as algebraic equations. They play a key r6le in computational fluiddynamics. Similar to finite difference schemes, values are calculated at discrete places o n a meshedgeometry. Vol-um(', integrals that con-tain a divergence term are converted to surface integrals, using the divergence theorem. These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each volume element. Because the flux en-tering a given volume is identical to that leaving the a d j a c e n t volume, these methods are conservative. Finite volume methods have been in the focusof applied mathematics for decades. They have well defined convergence properties and available code packages have rcached a very high degree of maturity and reliability.

What would happen if we change our assumption on the cosmological principle? This fundamentally important problem has not been pursued much,due to the mathematical difficulty in h~ndllr~g nonlinear processes. Not having alternatives due to practical difficulties in research does not guarantee that the presently available explanation should be correct. Scientific cosmology has the Universe as an external reality to compare. If the Universe looks simple in the standard model, is ig due to its intrinsic nature or to our simplifying assumptions?

Physics is the empirical science concerned with the behaviour of inanimate matter. The t6im? empirical science refers to the fact that physics relies solely in the abil-ity to test claims about the world with an experiment. Nevertheless, physics is aword and therefore has different meanings d ep e n d i ng t h e use of it in different contexts. For example, wecan also describe physics to be what physicist do. Before gettinginto a loop and describe a physicist as someone who does physics, we can define a physicist as those members o f society which work in physics departments and receive funding to do physics. In this context, physics is defined as anything this group of people do. These two meanings are interwoven but lhey- are not equivalent. Our first definition describes an activity, the second one describes an activity done by c e rta in people.

In SK14 we have argued that, as longas the initial time i chosen to be early enough, the choice of the value of fnth at the initial time does not affect the final value of fnth. In the inner region of the cluster, this is because the short turbulence dissipation time drives fnth quickly to i ts l i m i t i n g value determined by the ratio of td and the cluster mass growth time-scale (see Sect. 3.2 of SK14). In tile, cluster outskirts, the turbulence pressure does accumulate throughout time, but the growth is significant after the region enters the virial radius ofthe clust?er pahich oc-curs only at late times.

For the fully centralized structure, the perfo rmance of C-RANs is clearly constrained by the fron-thaul link capacity. In the uplink, for instance, RRHs need to sample, quantize, and then forward the received RF signals to the BBU pool. With densely deployed RRHs, the fronthaul traffic generated from a single UE with several MHz bandwidth could be easily scaled up to multiple gigabits per second (Gbps). In practice, a commercial fiber link with tens of GHz capacity could thus be easily overwhelmed even under moderate mobite traffic. One approach to this problem is to utilize the partially centralization structure though subs tantial signal processing capabilities are required on RRHs; the other alter-native is to adopt advanced techniques to optimize the performance under a fully centralized structure with constrained fronthaul. To simplify functionsand capabilities of RRH s, the latter so-lution is the focus of this article, and the corresponding key techniques are surveyed.

It is worth noticing that all the above models such as dark energy, f(R)-gravity and f(T)-gravity have shown to be, in broad sense, in agreement with observational data. As a consequence, unless higherprecision probes of the expansion rate and the growth of nsrut+l ;ai'o will be available, these ri-val approaches could not be discriminated. This degeneration about the theoretical back-ground suggests that a more conservative approach to the prob-lem of cosmic acceleration, relying on as less model dependent quantities as possi-ble, is welcome.

Of course, we should remind ourselves that, in our ordinary-matter world, those quarks can aggregate in no time, to hadrons, including nuclei, and the electrons serve to neutralize the charges also in no time. Then atoms, molecules, complex molecules, and so on. Th-ese serve as the seeds for the clusters, andthen stars, and then galaxies, may be in a time span of 1 Gyr (i.e., the age of our young Universe). The aggregation caused by strong and electromagnetic forces is fastenough to help giving rise to galaxies in a time span of 1 Gyr. On the otherhand, the seeded clusterings might proceed with abundance o l ' extra-heavy dark-matter particles such as familons and family Higgs, all greater than a few TeV and with relatively long lifetimes (owing to very limited decay channels). So, further s i m u l a t i o n s on galactic formation and evolutionmay yield clues on our problem.

Meanwhile, if the cosmological principle is even approximately true, there must be a reason for the fact. Inflation provides a possibility that t h e re-gion within our present horizon has originated from inside the horizon before the early acceleration phase, thus opening a possibility that the cosmological principle can be ac\hiev;ed through a causal mechanism. However, inflation has not pro-vided the actual mechanismfor that achievement. Although a class o f homogeneous but anisotropic models is known to be driven to an isotropic model through acceleration, the gen-eral mechanism is not known yet. Why is the Universe spatially homogeneous and isotropic? This ma?y de-serveto be one of the important theoretical problems in scientific cosmology.

The angular clustering es-timate for these 724 sources is shown in the t o p left panel of Fig. 4a, along with the two-parameter fit to this estimate. We see that the z < 0.3 angular clustering signal is fairly low for the two-parameter fit, with a large uncertainty on the clustering amplitude (see Table 1): the dilution of any intrinsic clustering signal due to the long line-of-sight (of order 30 times the width of the lightcone) is apparently too s e v e r e. I f we fix the slope at δ = 0.8 (as shown in Fig. 4b), we find a more significant one-parameter fit for the amplitude, although the uncertainty is still considerable.

Using two complementary RG methods, 1:(, have provided a comprehensive study of the relaxation dynamics in the Ohmic SBM. The SBM is considered to be the prototype model for a microscopic description of dissipation in open quantum systems. We exploit the mapping of the SBM onto the IRLM. We have studied two basic protocols: a re-laxation protocol in which at time t = 0 the system is prepared in a product state and the time evolution is performed with the SBM Hamiltonian as well as a quench protocol in which in addition at time tq )\ 0 a parameter of the Hamilto-nian is abruptly changed. While the FRG was used earlier to study quenches in locally correlated q u a n t um s y s t e ms we h e r e extended the RTRG to this type of nonequilibrium setup. A comparison of the results obtained us-ing our two approximate methods shows that bo t h provide controlled access to the dynamics of the SBM close to t he c o h e r e n t - t o - i n c o h e r e nt t r a n s i t i o n. In t he l i m it of e x p o n e n t i a l ly l a r ge t i m es of t h e relaxation protocol a comparison to established results derived by other approaches is possible and further substantiates this. Crucially, we present new results for intermediate to long times providing n prufound\ understanding of the details of the relaxation dynamics in all time regimes of interest, in particular thoserelevant for discussing the crossover from coher-ent to incoherent behavior.
We can reconcile t h i s apparent d?is-cr.e?paney by noting that the cause of the instability of Q-balls with a large energy per net baryon is quantum mechanical decay. Suchdecay is not treated in numerical simulations of the classical field. Thus, our estimates would lead us to conclude that unlesssome way of damping out the ellipticity of a partially-charged AD condensate is present, we must question whether such condensates will truly form Q-balls.

Inour tests v;~*et assume the observations span approximately one com-pletesolar activity c ycle,and so we therefore use fitting models based on the cosinusoidal m o d e l . A cosinusoidal variation is of course not an ideal match to the real observed time variation of the solar activity cycle; however, our point here is to test the principle of the technique. We begin with tests on artificial data that do have anunderlying variation of the frequencies that is cosinusoidal in time. We then apply the technique to real low-l timeseries, which have lengths spanning approximately one 11-yr solar activity cycle.

On the other hand, interstellar travel does not necessarily require large accelerations. Small accelerations sustained over long periods of time suffice.
In case I, a = 1, and if m > 0, then Ax is positive. This implies that in order to keep the observer comoving with the wall it has to accelerate away from the symme-try plane or inother words it is attracted towards the wall. Similarly if m < 0, then the wall exhibites a repulsive nature to the observer. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the domain w a ll s o l u t i o n s of case II (ii).
We now sort the φ(x, y) values from lltch,rGcsl;I to smallest. The sorted list gives us an implicit representation for S(P/i) for every i ≥ τ. Indeed, it suffices to binary search for the first occurrence of i; the elements to the left correspond to primitive points which are inside P/i.

Interferometry will be important fordisentangling these compact outflows, identifying their driving sources, and provide a better estimate of their energetics.

One problem we had to facewas tfat of gauge invariance. Unlike QED, where the charge renormalization was trivially gauge invariant (because the pho-ton is neutral), the renormalization constants in Q C D were all gauge dependent. However the physics could not depend on the gauge. Another issue was the choice of regularization. Dimensional regularization had not really been developed yet, and we had to convince ourselves that the one-loop β-function was insensitive to .them regulictrization used. We did the calculation in an arbitrary gauge. Since we knew that the answer had to be gauge in-variant, we could use gauge invariance as a check on our arithmetic. This wasgood since we both kept on making mistakes. In F e bruary the pace pickedup, and we completed the calculation in a spurt of activity. At one point a sign error in one term convinced us that the theory was, as expected, non-asymptotically free. As I sat down to put it all together and to write up our results, I caught the error. At almost the same time Politzer finished his calculation and we compared, through Sid-ney, our results. The agreement was satisfying.
We have thus improved the limit obtained byRamberg and Snow by a factor about 40.
Introduction
After a decade of intensivestudy, our understanding of exclusive double charmonium production has gradually matured. The most notable lesson is perhaps that, the NRQCD factorization approach has proved to be a successful and indispensable tool in daliu with hard exclusive reactions involving heavy quarkonium. However, in our opinion, this research area is still far from being closed, and thereremain some important questions to be answered. In the following, we enumerate two topics which may urgently beg for the exploration.
The basic CCD reductions (bias-subtraction, dark-correction, flat-fielding) were carried out within standard IRAFV2.12.2 routines.

Numerical modeling of type II critical collapse of relativistic fluids even in spherical symmetry is a rather challenging task. The reason is that the dynamics takes place at ever decreasing spatial length scale and also the density and pressure of the fluid increase by many orders of magnt~,nalsde. For example, in our calculations the density and pressure increase typically by a factor of million for the nearly critical solutions (in the subcritical r\e\gime? and in some of the supercritical calcula-tions the central densityreached a value greater than 1054. It is clear that some kind of adaptivity is required in order to perform these calculations.

If theoretical models, in whichmatter is considered on an equal footing with geometry, are allowed, gravitational theories with many interesting d novel features can be constructed.

Abstract
After removing p a r t i c l e s used in the Btag r e c o n s t r u c t i o n , we require that an event have only one charged track, that its charge be opposite that of the Btag and that its laboratory-frame momentum exceed 1.0 GeV/c. This charged track is required to satisfy |dz | <2.0 cm and dr < 0.5cm, where |dz | and dr are the distances of clos-est a p p r o a c h to the interactionpoint along and perpendicular to the beam axis.

At time t = 0, the input is on the first line and a simulation of A starts on that line witha mark on the leftmost cell of the word. At each subsequent time, the original input is copied on the next line (moving up), and a new simulation of A is started on that line with the mark on the next position (moving right). At time t = n, the first line has simulated n steps of A with a mark on the f ir st c -e ll, while the n-th line starts a new simulation w it h the mark on the last cell.

We consider the densities of spin and OAM operators in the representation of spherical (multipole) photons (integrands in (2) and (3) ). We show that these operators have the same structure in terms of photon operators but different spatial dependence at short and intermediate distances. In the wave (far) zone, this difference vanishes, so that there is no way to distinguish between the spin and OAM parts of the total AM o f a multipole photon. Besides that, we consider generation of photon twl~s entangled with respect to the total angular momentum.

Rapidly evolving genomic technologies are providing biologically informative data of un-precedented volume, velocity, and vari-ety, with the potential to yield new insights into the processes driving disease. This data has allowed us to develop a more unified understanding of how many different types ofinteractions at multiple and vastly different scales can influence biological systems. We now appreciate that changes in cellular states involve simultaneous alterations to the genome, epigenoIme transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome of t h e cell. These are often characterized by complex networks whose structures are alteredas the phenotype changes. The generation o f Big Data in this area now p resents an unprecedented opportunity to develop scalable methods capable of modeling these networks, informing us about the nature of disease and ultimately allowing us to hypothesize about the therapeutic approaches most appropriate for each disease state.

A secondary objection is philosophical in nature. Bayesians l)'fe-fer to treat the true value of ican he pa ra m et ec ds a random variable, with the experimental data as the fixed and unchanging measure of reality. The parameter then has some probability of falling within the confidence region. The traditional approach treats thetrue value of the parameter as fixed and unchanging, and the data as only one possible outcome in an imaginedensemble, a shadow or projection of the true reality. The confidence region that we calculate from this instantiation of the data then has some probability of covering the true value of the parameter.

Section 4 contains a study of the effect tinis exerted on the correlation function by a nonzero spectral width, section 5 contains an example with semi-realistic pion spectral function in hot nuclear matter. Finally we draw some conclusions and discuss the experimental relevance.

The joint !(lIr?~u:? has the advantage of only requiring a single evalu-ation of the measurements. The refinement step introduces additional computational complexity but has also shown to significantly increase the efficiency of the sampling in higher dimensional state space models. Once an appropriate architecture for the sequential MCMC is selected, there is additional flexibility which arises in the form of selection of the proposal distributions. A common choice f o r the joint draw is to utilise the following proposal distribution:

By the time the simulation reaches 200 Myr (bluedot-dashed liae), star formation has depleted the gas, causing the surface density to drop by a factor of 2.0 in dIsk -FAFOhly and 1.5 for disk SF+PEheat. Since star formation occurs in the coldest and densest regions of the disk, the azimuthally averaged temperature rises as do the corresponding values for the velocity dispersion and Q. The velocity dispersion also increases due to gravitational heating, as star particles are formed to create local d e e p po-tential wells. This effect is strongest inthe disk without diffuse h e a t i n g , since 500,000 more star particles have formed by this time, causing a greater depletion of the dense gas.

A disadvantage is that the esti-mated probabilities are not guaranteed positive.

Case without symmetry
However, due to the singularity of h at r =0, and the fact that the transverse dimensions are non-compact, any integration over y is likely to be divergent. Worse, each term in theaction will generally pick up different powers of the function h such that the divergences cannot even be gathered into a common divergence multiplying the entire action. This means that d iw~ rg ence wi ll pr o lif er a te in the equatiQnnts of motion, and our effective theorywill be poorly defined. As a first step toward rectifying this problem, we assume there is someregion of moduli space in which powers of h are well approximated by a series-expansion to first order:
B(X, Y) = Y4 + X4 + 6X3Y3 + X3Y7 + 6X4Y4 + X7Y3 .
One of the main drawbacks of this approach is the lack of information regarding the coordinate space, which leads to ambiguities in ,thc definition of the velocity of the particle. Also, one would like to havea classical version of the theory, in terms of a phase space endowed with a symplectic structure. This will be the subject of Sections 3 and 4.

On the other hand, since April 2007 we are operating the phase II of the Tupi experiment, with two directional muon telescopes at sea level and located at 22S and 43W, inside the SAA region and close to its central area. This characteris-tic supplies to the muon telescopes the lowest rigidity of response to cosmic protons andions ( ≥0.4 GV). This value is approximately halfof the rigidity of the polac, regions. In addition, the SAA is like a hole in the magnetosphere and the IMF lines overtake the surface, in the day side, in this region. Conseguentl5y, the magnetic anomaly works like a funnel fo r incoming charged particles from space. The main effect of the SAA is an increase of the muon intensity at sea level in this region, in up to 10 times in the day side.

The simplest situation has 16 ninebranes at each of the two orientifold planes to cancel anoma-lies; the low-energy dynam-ics consists of 11d supergravity in the bulk, and 10d SYM on these walls. Since the (2,1) string seems only to describe a brane in spacetime, to realize these vacua as a (2,1) string background one might look for a wrapped mem-brane/string that sees this structure, see figure 5.
As an approximation, we assume that the continuous dynamics of orientation within arcing seg-ments of the trajectory are independent of the discrete reorientation events, and that the reorientation events are instataneous. Then the full orientation correlation function is the product of two terms,

Here we ask and answer, in the Bayesian MPE framework, the elementary question: What source brightness is needed to reduce the MPE below a given threshold for discriminating a single pair of closely spaced, equally bright point sources of a given separation from a single point source of the same brightness located at the midpoint of the line joining the pair? This defines a simpler problem of binary hypothesis tesl\ng within the Bayesian detection framework, avoiding a more involved problem in which the matter of such bi-nary discrimination is coupled with the additional requirement of estimating the spacing between the point-source p air . The m i nim u m si gn al st r e n gths needed forthis single source vs. pair source discrimination, as we shall see, are rather modest and consistent with the growing experimental evidence for high-precision optical superresolution (OSR) of p o i n t sources.

On the other hand, the dynamics of each sub-domain might be defined in terms of the characteristic curves associated withthe activityvariable.

In this paper, we calculate the absorption coefficient of intergalactic space using a new, empirically based calculation of the spectral energy distri-bution (SED) of intergalactic low energy photons (Malkan & Stecker 1998; hereafter MS98) obtained by integrating luminosity dependent infrared spectra of galaxies over their luminosity and redshift distributions. After giving our results on the γ-ray optical depth as a function of energy and redshift out to a redshift of 0.3, we apply our calculations by comparing our results with re-cent spectral data on Mrk 421 as reported by McEnery, et al. (1997) and spectral dta on Mrk 501 given by Aharonian, et al. (1997). The results presented here supercede those of our previous calculations (Stecker &De Jager 1997), which were based more on theoretical models (see discussion in MS98). We consider the results presented here to be considerably morereliable than any presented previously.
The quiver with two vertices a, b and with r ≥ 2 arrows from a to b is often called a generalized Kronecker quiver, and we call a path algebra of such a quiver a generalized Kronecker algebra.

Finally, we note that the trapping potentials experienced by the molecule in the upper and lower states may be different. However, side-band cooling can still occur in this regime and leads to similar cooling rates and final temperaturesas described above.

Conventional particles can be the equiva-lent of phonons or soli-tons, as excitations of the superbradyonic ground state of matter (the vacuum) at the fundamental length scale. Their properties would then not be the ultimat e fundamental properties of matter. Standard interactions may have been topologically generated in such a scenario. Also, our Universe may not be the only possible one. If different universes can also be formed, the pl+cp(,,rtib\s? of standard particles may be universe dependent.
Thus Nψ2 = in.
In strong contrast, in typical numerical simulations of phantom systems, all polymers (or particles) are ascribed to la tt i ce sit e s , and then cross-links are randomly introduced, connecting some neighboring particles. After removing the sol part, the system is allowe d to relax at nonzero t e m pe ratu re, with intra-cluster repulsion completely ignored. This corresponds to a large positive value for B0 buta vanishing value of B. As we shall soon see, it is this qualitative diffetence between B0 and B that is responsible for conductivity-like scaling of the shear modulus in phantom networks.

As formulated by Wilson, the lattice cutoffis remarkable in remaining true to many of the underlying connépts of a- gauge theory. At the most simplistic level, a Yang-Mills theory issimply electrodynami:C/(cS embellished with isospin symmetry. By working directly with elements of the gauge group, this is inherent in lattice gauge theory from the start.

Fagocm the above analysis, wE see that a net, topologi-cally nontrivial fundamental gap exists only at intermediate shell th i ckne ss. If the shell is too thin, then the effective gap is positive and the fundamental gap is topolog-ically trivial. On the other hand, if the shell is too thic k , then although the effective gap turns negative, the electron-like band overlaps w ith too many valence bands, which causes the hybridization gap to be covered u p. Thus, no fundamental band gap would exist.
All the above parameters are set real and positive using U(1)R symmetry and an appropriate shift of the imaginary components of the moduli fields, while θ represents the relative phase among the exponentials. We also assume the relation between the parameters in the exponents

Here we have considered the (n + 2)-dimensional Husain space-time in presence of radiating null fluid, barotropic fluid, an electro-magnetic field and a scalar field with po t e i a l . The corresponding solutions have been obtained. Next we have analyzed the gravitational collapse of a star in Husain space-time. The e x i s t e n ce o f outgoing rad ial null geodesic has been thoroughly investigated in order l ebanatterIze the nature of central singularity formed as the end state of collapse. Equation of radial null geodesic is formed and the values of the variable X0 is computed for different values of parameters in different dimensions. Surprisingly in all the cases it was found that irrespective of the values of the parameters chosen, the value of X0 is always positive and hence the singularity formed is always a naked singularity. This has been shown in a tabu-lar form. Impact of accretion phenomenon on the gravitational collapse of a star has also been taken into account. The mass function for a collapsing procedure is considered and from it, the equation of X0 is constructed for various dimensions. To study this case graphs were drawn for different va , ucs of t h e parameters (f0, g0, e0, E0) and it was found that the figures did not show any tendency of sneak-ing into the negative region. Hence blackholes may not be the correct op-tion for Husain metric in any dimension. Formation of event horizons is totally barred in Husai metric. So the only possibility is a naked singularity. Hence this is a significant counter example of thecosmic censorship hypothesis.

Therefore, H1 is α-subnormal. It implies ρ(H1) ≤ ρ(H2). When the inequality holds, f(H1) = H2 (other-wise ρ(H1) ≤ ρ(f(H1)) < ρ(H2)), and for any v ∈ V(H1) and e ∈ E(H1), v ∈ e if and only if f(v) ∈ f(e). This implies that f must be an injective map (otherwise, we have f(v1) = f(v2), ,th'cn we can lin\d an edge e1 containing v1. Since f is a homomorphism, v2 is not in e1, but f(v2) = f(v1) ∈ f(e1). Contradiction.) Hence, f is an isomorphism.

Furthermore, we have investigated the possibility of exploiting SR for detecting small single-cycle and few-cycle signals in noisy environment. We have found that a proper amount of noise can leadto S R which enhances the sensitivity of detection. Our work provides insights into the behavior of bistable systems under the combined influence of weak single-cycle (or few-cycle) periodic modulation and n?oisew' Because conventional techniques, such a s phase sensitive lock-in and heterodyne detection schemes, are not applicable to detecting single-cycle and few-cycle signals buried in noise, the method demonstrated here is promising for applications where signals are unavoidably mixed up with noise and only last a very small number of cycles.

Conclusions
The a pproxi mat ions of (or substitutes for)continuous spacetime by finitary structures are studied in this paper. The results presented furnish a framework in which one might express such ideas as variable spacetime topology or, for in-stance, the topological fluc-tuations on small scales. The paper is organized as follows.

Inour analysis W' considered the situation when the scaling ansatz is obeyed exactly. We expect h#wetv~rthal.ollr result~ remain qualitatively valid evenfor systems with small deviations from the exactly scalable Hamiltonians. For example, weak lattice potentials should not have dramatic effects as long as the effective mass approximation is applicable. Therefore one could achieve a full description of time-of-flight experiments if the lattice potential and interactions are tuned accordingly. Moreover it is conceivable that on aphenomenological levelthe ansatz can be used even when the time- and space-dependencies o f system parameters do not fully satisfy the consistency equations. The scaling solution could then be seen as a universality class of non-equilibrium sys-tems, very muchlike a renormalization group fixed point at equilibrium. It would be interesting to address this conjecture in experiments.

Improvements are also requiredo estimate the stellar masses since a proxy (absolute J-band magnitude) of the stellar mass has been used in this study to select our sample. Combination of realistic stel-lar population with different ages andmetal content has to be performed on both the whole spectral ener gy distribu-tion (from UV to near-IR) and ~?h(! spectroscopic absorption lines (Lick indices). Nevertheless, we do find that all distant starbursts are consistent with major merger phases, and these sources are strongemit-ters in near-IR. It is unclear whether wc m ay have missed a signifi-cant populationof massive starbursts without strong emission in near-IR. Besides this, technical limitations (see IMAGES-I) have prevented us from measuring the kinematics of 3 starbursts, because their emission line region are too compact (see Fig. 9). Their optical morpholo-gies are also consistent with mergers (see Fig. 9 and its caption).

Basic Security Considerations
While one can actually determine the matrix element itself on the lattice, B-parameters are obtained from ratios of corre-lation functions in which many statistical and systematic uncertainties are expected to cancel. Furthermore, the ma-trix element has mass dimension four and therefore suffers very strongly from theuncertainty associated with the determination of the lattice cutoff which is of order 10% inpresent day quenched calculations. As we shall also see later, it is advantageous to get the matrix elem ent from an independent determination of BBq and fBq and the experimental value of MBq.

Dense knots of material which follow ballistic trajectories may also be expelled from the disk by superbubbles. Knots formed by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities as a superbubble breaks through the disk material and begins to accelerate into the halo follow ballistic trajectories awayfrom the disk, as they have significantly higher columndensities than the halo material (Cioffi 1986). These knots of material may lead to relatively disconnected clouds of dense material in the low-halo of spiral galaxies. If dust survives in these fragments of the evolved superbubble, the ejected clouds may pr ovide a source ofhalo dust grains. Greater knowledge of the degree to which dust can survive in the walls of supershells is needed to assess the role these structures may play in lifting dustbeyond the t h i n disk of spirals.

A genetaliczation of WEP claims that Special Relativity is locally valid. Einstein realized,after the formulation of Special Relativity, that the mass can be reduced to a manifestation of energy and momentum.

According to this observation, Einstein EP states:

An extensive study was made including 16 samples among published work on terahertz QCLs from the last ten ye a rs, us in g our NEGF simulation scheme. Using identical simulation parameters, we find that the simulated current does not agree with experimental results for all samples. However, we observe a clear trend that these deviations are similar for samples form a given laboratory. This shows that samples from if\ferent laboratories a re not fully comparable. We show that interface roughness alone cannot account for these deviations in the simulated current under lasing compared to experimental data. Assuming different calibrations of doping density or Al content ?in different laboratories could explain these trends. However more intricate issues, such as different barrier profiles, cannot be erute out.

However, the increments 1 + a when each node is introduced are not statistically independent.

It is important to distinguish between these very different potential origins of the soft excessas l?h+'y make very different predictions about the environment and geometry of the accreting material close to the black hole. The extreme broad iron lines requ ired i n the pure reflection models are not required in the absorption models (either smeared: Sobolewska & Done 2007; Done 2007 or partial covering: Miller et al. 2008) as the broad feature redwards of the iron line is fit instead by continuum cu r v atur e. All the absorption models require the presence of material above the inner dic, probably in the form of a wind, whereas the reflection models instead suggest a clean line of s i g h t to the inner disc. The large velocity shear in the smeared wind model requires that the material is strongly accelerated, so it potentially carries an enormous amount of kinetic energy (Chevallier et al. 2006; Schurch & Done 2006) with c~rlefipdnntityi'ng impact on AGN feedback/galaxy formation.

The resulting differential equations for the approximations of the mean and quantum covariance matrix of the system observables form a self-consistent set of equations \vh ich, despite their nonlinear-ity, produce a legitimate quantum covariance matrix.

By integrating out high frequency modes in strong coupling perturbation theory a lattice gauge magnet was obtained. The resulting theory confines or screens the spin of hole quasiparticles at the intersection points (copper atoms), resulting in pairing and superconductivity. Because of the role of oxygen nuclear motion, at least a weak oxygen isotope effect should result. There is an second charge condensate, corresponding to the Goldstone modeof the fractionally charged, spinning Higgs field.

Several authors suggested that the bulk viscosity can drLw,~ the universe into a period of exponential expansion (inflation) (Murphy, Grφn, Beesham, Arbab). This is r e a l l y the case, as the effect of bulk viscosity in an expandinguniverse - to decrease the pressure making the total pre~surenegative. Infl ati o n can also be induced by higher order corrections (Starobinsky, 1980). In scalar field, ll':_l~lysnieo? stopped by the slow roll-down of the scalar field from the false vacuum to the true vacuum. In this work, we investigate the coupling o f gravity with vac-uum and viscosity. Provided a certain conspiracy is maintained the evolution of the universe can proceed in an attractive way. We have found that such a recipe is possible and leads to interestingfeatures related to the cosmic e v o \ l u t i e v e r . Inflation is triggered by the vacuum energy bulk viscosity cooperation. This work generalizesour recent model of phantom and dark energy mod-els (Arbab, 2@07 ).

Molecular cooling is described in Paper I, but now in addition, we have included metal line radiative cooling in the optically thin limit. To simulate metals in our simulations, we define a generic mass snlar in FLASH,which is advected with any flows. For the cooling rates we u s e the tabulated results from Weirsma et al (2008), which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, and in all cases we use standard solar abundance ratios. The radiative rates are defined over a large tem-perature range, from 102 K~ through 109 K. The specific cooling rate f o r a given tem-perature is found using a table lookup from a data file and scaling by the local metallicity.

The cutoff Coulomb approach is seen to produce accurately converged results for a single-shot calculation, regardless of the size of the simulation cell (as long as it is bigger than the extent of the nonzero density). The only requirement is that the original cell must, for the purposes of Fourier transforms, be embedded in a padded cell of suf-ficient size. Thisgenerally entails quite a largetemporary memory requirement, af3 in small systems the performance of FFTs can become the limiting factor on thespeed of the whole calculation. However, in large systems, where the Hartree calculatio n is generally not a significant part of the total computational effort, this is no longer an issue.

This is an extremely strong constraint which very much disfavors the natural solutions to the hierarchy prob-lem, and is independent of the arguments we gave in the previous section. This is widely recognized and thus there has been a major effort to search for generic w ays out or at least loopholes to this bound. On the other hand, even if there are loopholes, the bound still might be generic. In the context of the string landscape, the correct attitude would thenbe to accept il as preferred, also allowing the vacua (and cosmological histories) which realize t h e loophole, but weighing them by appropriate tuning factors. We will begin this discussion below.

By solving analytically the master equation describing the evolution of the twoqubits, we analyzed dynamics of the three GQDs, and found t h a t they are incompatible in characterizing quantum correlations, although they are all well defined from a geometric perspective. Our f in cli n fs are il l u st r ci te d through two distinct behaviors of the three GQDs. First, we found that the three GQDs may exhibit com-pletely different SCs for both the two-sided and the one-sided reservoirs. The critical timesfor the SCs and the times of SCs are strongly dependent on thc choice of the GQD measure and the form of the initial state. Different GQD measures have different SCs, and thus the SCs are in fact the combined result of the chosen GQD m e a s u r e and the quantum state, but not the intriusic property of a sta te itself. This is fundamentally different from the sudden death of entanglement, which is independent of the entanglement measure.Moreover, we also revealed the relativity of different GQDs. To be explicit, we found that the thermal reservoir may lead to a generation of qualo-cnme states manifesting different orderings, and this implies that different GQDs are incomparable as their behaviors may not only be quantitatively but also be qualitativelydifferent.

Introduction
One of the most important goals in surface science is to be able to control dynamical processes takingplace at a surface. We have proposed substrate patterning as a means to control the relaxation dynamics of low-frequency frustrated-translational vibrations of an adsorbate overlayer. This proposal emerges from our recent work demonstrating that the dominant relaxation mechan ism for these modes is resonant emission of phonons into the substrate. Specifically, we have considered short-period superlattices as candidatesubstrates, because the mass modulation of a superlattice causes gaps to open in the phonon density of states. Vary ing the super-lslttice ?nmposltihave aliovsoe? to control the size and placement of these band gaps, thereby controllably modifying the coupling between ,the adsorbate overlayer and the substrate. We view the successful experimental demonstration of the behavior pre-dicted here as a stringent test of our theory of resonant adsorbate-substrate cou-pling. Moreover it would establish substrate patl;ernilig as an important tool in surface dynamical research.

In summary, theMHD kink instability has been identified experimentally as a poloidal flux amplification mechanism for coaxial gun spheromak formation. An n = 1 central column helical instability was observed during formation using multiple-frame CCD imaging. Onset of the perturbation was shown using two independent sets of data to agree quantitatively with the Kruskal-Shafranov limit. The kink acts as a dynamo which converts toroidal to poloidal flux, and it is followed immediately by three key signatures of spheromak formation: (1) closed ψ-contours, (2) ψ-amplification, and (3) magnetic field profiles s i m i l a r to the Taylor state.

Because a physical pion would feel the boundaries of the box in which we work and because the algorithms we use slow down rapidly for lighter quarks, we are restricted to work with quarks with masses on the order of ms/2 or more.

Comparing Fig. 2 with Fig. 3, we see that the main difference between the clamped and unclamped case is that in the atomic layers with lateral composition modulation (layers 2 and 4), the hydrostatic strain (sum of all three diagonal strain com-ponents) is much smaller in the unclamped structure than in the clamped structure. This would lead to a major difference in the b a n d - e d g e profile for the two structures to be discussed below.

Our analysis has shown that a self-calibrating api)roach .l; in-corporating calibration uncertainties works well with the current SN Ia data sets. The self-calibrating Hubble dia-gram can be constructed for any compilation of data from various surveys as the photometric mea s ur eme n Ls are compared relative to a single reference star. However, we identified non-linear effects of the perturbation of the reference spectrum os an issue for using this method with the current data and included a quality cut for this in the data selection framework accordingly. Aso we ,ha~e omittedthe re-training of the SN Ia light-curve template. Based on a related stu dy this is only a 5% effqFctand ilncewill not alter the conclusions significantly. However, for a future study of the self calibration method, it would be appropriate to further investigate the role of the light curve training.

Nevertheless, matter does affect the free energy. It is interesting to describe this effect entirely in the flux picture. The idea isto see what is happening to the flmux configurations when one side of the effective potentialforthe lines is lowered. Lowering the free energy means increasing the partition function. I will show that this increase in Z comes from an increase in the number of allowed fluxconfigurations in the presence of UGat-er i.e. an entropy increase.

Changing Mcut means t h at e ven though clusters in the MR models start at the same mass, their luminosities wInll be very different. Initially, clusters with a high Mcut will be much more luminous than those with alow Mc ut. It might be thought that, as the high-Mcut clusters lose so much more of their mass, they will become less luminous.
Here, we argue that the scenario of HV is unlikely to be pertinent to the physics near BN in YbRh2Si2. A number of key features in the HV proposal contradict the salient experimental results.

In order to obtain a static RSA from a changing flip traversal, we use the notion of a trace. A trace is a domain on the βn × βn gri.It consists ofedges and boxes: an edge is a line segment of length 1 whose endpoints have positive integer coordinates; a box is a square of side length 1 whose corners have positive integer coordinates. Similar to arborescences, we require that a trace R (i) is (topologically) connected; (ii) contains the root (1, 1); and (iii) from every gri d point contained in R thereexists an x- andy-monotone path .to the root t h a t lies completely in R. We say R is a covering trace for S (or, R c ver s S) ,f? every sink in S is part of R.

Therefore, as shown in the present p ape r , although the magneticfield freezing-in effect is universal (i.e., manifests itself in a similar way in media with isotropic and strongly anisotropic conductivities), the physical mechanisms responsible for it are absolutely different in these two limiting cases. In an isotropic plasma, freezing-in is due to induc-tion currents, which compensate the variation of the magnetic flux through a closed contour moving together withthe conducting substance. In the case of a plasma with a strong anisotropy, freezing-in is a direct consequence of particularities of the electrodynamic drift which are associated wii;h the divergence-free character of the magnetic field and the equipotential character of the field lines.

The relaxation time Trelax is the time-scale on which the ei’suetsfftaur will lose all traces of its initial condition (Yadav et al. 2013). Due to internal dynamics of the cluster, the contraction and destruction forces make the cluster approach a Maxwellian equilibri-um. Through this time, low mass stars may evaporate with large random veloci-ties trying to occupy a larger volume than the high mass stars do (Mathieu and Latham 1986). Mathematically, relaxation time has the following form (Spitzer a n d Hart 1971):

The strong interaction is believed to be described by SU(3) gauge theory. As an. asymptotic free theory, it has successful applications in high energy region (i.e., E > 1GeV), but in low energy region (i.e., E < 1GeV), one cannot make ordinaty perturbation calculations since, in this region, the coupling constant becomes large. To describe the physics of strong interaction in low en-ergy region, o ne may develop some effective theories which re-flect the symmetries and symmetry breaking in this enetgy region. In this note, we focus on the chiral effective Lagrangian theory.

Apart of the role of strange quark mass in general, there is also a general issue of correct co nnec tion of units and vacuum parameters (with the instanton density be-ing one of them) for QCD with differentnumber of flavors?. (For example, between no-quark or quenched QCD and the physical world.) In order to study all of this, it important to know what is the absolute magnitude of the fermionic determinants in the instanton-based vacuum models considered. Some of those are repoted in this section.
We start by considering the total action for a bound system (in our present case, a galaxy) with a very large number N of constituents. Let E be the to-tal energy.

Combining these two quantities, we get

The STAR Heavy Flavor Tracker, with its ex-tremely precise and thin inner layers, is designed specifically to allow direct reconstruction, with low background, of charmed hadrons from their hadronic decay modes, from rather low pT up to 10 GeV/c. This allows one to investigate the chemistry of charm fragmentation, and search for its modification in heavy ion collisions, by reconstructing and comparing a number of different charmed hadrons from D0 to Λc. For flow studies, total charm cross sections, and correlations, the loss of information throughthe undetected neutrino in semi-leptonic decays causes ambiguities. These ambiguities prevent precise measurements in the hydrodynamic regime of parent DpT below approximately 2 GeV/c, and can complicate precise interpretation of suppression patterns at higher pT. Direct reconstruction of charmed hadrons using the Heavy Flavor Trackerremoves these ambiguities.
We can choose our model parameters of Hamiltonian (equation 1) such that our hexagonal lattice contains an average of 2 atoms per unit cell or close to it.

No other phase transitions are detected below 5 GPa. The phase diagram of solid oxygen therefore has been completely determined,deleting uncertain phase transition boundaries at low temperature. The sensitivity of the X-ray diffraction techn6nqLLe has been essen-tial to clarify the weakness of previous spectroscopic work, where phase transitions can be detected only by subtle kinks in the pressure slope of mode frequencies. In addition, the results of this work can furnish a precise recipe to be followed to avoid metastability and obtain a good annealing of an solid oxygen sample.
We have analyzedtwo-qubit gates in a pair of qubits,each encoded into singlet and triplet states of a DQD , anclcoupled by Coulomb repulsion.

The tracing of the p eak intensity along the dispersion axis is done by searching for more maxima around the original location within a cer-tain window, specified by the user. This is an iterative process, starting in the original column, and continuing across the CCD. The result is a trace mask containing the central locations of each fibre, at each pixel in thedispersion direction. The user specifies the distance between adjacent maxima, and th e y must also account for the large gaps between the blocks of 50 fibres. A visual inspection of the tra(:e mask superimposed on the domeflat is therefore often required to check that the in-put parameters are s a t i s f a c t o r y , and that the gaps are being dealt with accordingly, as this can be difficult to implement automatically.

The final constraint comes from the study of tidally disrupted stars in globular clusters. Observations of globular clusters have shown tidal tai.1s of stars ac-tively being removed from these systems (Irwin & Hatzidimitriou 1993; Grillmair e\t al 1995) and have bee used to argue that giohnfer clusters do not contain dark matter (Moore 1996; Conroy et al 2010). If globular clusters reside within dark matter halos these tidal stars would be suppressed, which suggests that they formed via a different mechanism than galaxies.

The gravitational radius in the Schwarzschild solution in D = 4 is arbitrary, too. It is in fact possible to find a similar symmetry there.Although this arbitrariness and the existence of a corresponding symmetry in both di-mensions are closely related to the arbitrariness in choosing boundary conditions, there is a crucial difference in both dimensions: T h a nks to the Weyl invariance of the matter coupling in D = 2, the symmetry (2) is exact at the classical level even in the presence of the matter. That is, the matter does not feel the gravity mediated by the Weyl degree of freedom at the classi-cal level, unless the matter coupling violates the Weyl invariance. (A test particle, for instance, would feel the black hole because its coupling violates the symmetry (2).)

The process is still clearly irreducible, and the stationary distribution obeys the stationary conditions Qn(ν, λ)πn = O where the generator matrix Qn now also depends on λ. We can express the stationary distribution directly in the parameter s as πn(ν, λ) = {π: Qn(ν, λ)π = 0}. For λ = 0 the model reduces to the ordinary Edge Formation Random Walk.

We nbmrrew the ideas above and apply them to the context of nonequilibrium dynamics. The total Hamiltonian dictating the dynamics of the system is written in a basis that incorporates the initial state as one of its vectors. The width of the energy distribution of the initial state corresponds to the width of what we call, here, the energy shell. The lifetime of the initial state depends on how large this width is and on the filling of the silell. As we show, when the width of the energy shell is small com-pared to the width of the density of states and when it is not well filled, which happens for initial states closetotheedges of the spectrum, the relax-ation p-rstai'mess c~.n become very slow. This scenario is further aggravated by integrable Hamiltonians, the presence of symmetries, and theobservable studied.

Silicate melts a nd glasses are an important class of materials in very different fields, e.g. in geosciences (since silicates are geologically the most relevant materials) and in Dtechuology (windows, containers, and optical fibers). From a physical p o i nt o f toutiew it is a very challenging task to understand the properties of these materials on a microscopic level, and in the last twenty years many studies o n different systems liavc shown that molecular dynamics computer simulations are a very appropriate tool for this purpose (Angell et al., 1981, Balucani and Zoppi, 1994, Kob, 1999). The main advantage of such s imu la tion s is that they give access to the whole mi c r o s co pic informationin form of the particle trajectories which of course cannot be determined in real experiments.
Applying the pinch-technique (PT) construction to the three-gluon vertex occurring in a physical process involving three external on-shell legs, one arrives at a dressed tree-level skeleton graph, dressed with pinch-technique vertices and self-energies as shown in Fig. 2.

With these ratios, the source brightness of a lensing event varies as

The physical meaning of the above result may become clearer by examining the pressure-volume isotherms.

This hybrid model also allows us to p redic t when the forward shock will break out of the CSM photosphere based on the fit to the optical light curve.

An alternative approach that makes clear the connection between axis inversion and spin w ithout the same difficulty,is to invert the axes t hat are perpendicular to thevelocity. Our argument identifies the \[l',hamiedncss of the coordinate system with the change of spin, hence inverting these axesshould change the spin and does not impact on the direction of the velocity. We verify the effect of perpendicular axis inversion for momentum and velocity along the x̂3 direction and leave other verifications to known Dirac equation symmetries or exer-cises.

The relation between observed inte-grated colours for whole cluster population and MS population are fairly explained by the model predictions obtained in the present work. This indicates that the estimated observed integrated colours of MS populationof MC clusters fairly represent the MS population of theMC clusters. Main conclusion of the present study are;

With the lemma, we can design an improved degree distribution based on a target k for LT codes with low overhead. Denote σ ∈ (0, l] as the ratio of the spike being reduced from RSD (degree-1 node is increased accordingly). Then we can obtain the equations as below to analyze its asymptotic behavior:
The main goal of this s u b s e c t i o n is to prove some estimates involving the minimax levels cλ, k, c0, k, c∞ and cf∞.
The collocation that ends with an adjective is created from a word combination adjective + noun in the original tex t . The adjective describes one par-ticular feature of the noun; this yields on a new collocation in which noun becomes the actor and adjective an object of the collocation. We assign the word sein a link-ing role in the collocation and represent it as a fact. The new collocation inherits th e collocation numbcl; of the sentence, which it was a part of and thus preserves the time flow of the text. This way we achieve the unique sentence structure that we need, and keep the original semantical value of the text.

Special attention is given to the realistic scenario where the channel state is not known perfectly at the receiver. Rather, it must be inferred from available observations. In this latter case, the optimization problem becomes a partially observable decision process. This forces the controller to make decisions based on an estimated distribution over the channel state. This problem is cast into a dynamic program-ming framework with limited state knowledge. Known system dynamics and partial observations are combined at every step to update the estimated distribution and, subsequently, take action.

Tetramer-dimer phases
DIS processes provided the first measurement of parton densities. We saw in the previous sections t hat a combination of the different (weak and electromagnetic) struc-ture functions with different targets (proton, neutron, isoscalar nuclei) can be used to establish different properties of the charged partons such as their spin, charge assignment etc. The individual parton densities can be extracted from the data on F2 only under certain assumptions and one usually fits a form to these. The fits are constrained by various sum rules which are derived on general principles. However, none of the DIS processes can give information about the gluon densities. In the framework of perturbative QCD, outside the realm of quark-parton model, some information about gluon densities is obained by studying the scauing violation (q2 de pendence) of the structure functions. But no direct informationon the gluons is available from lici processes. It i s also important to note that since there are, as yet, no theoretical predictions for either quark/gluon densities, it is imperative to find processes other than DIS to extract combination of parton densities different from those measured in DIS, to supplement our knowl-edge. This, in turn, can help to get a more complete picture of parton densities.

There is a possibly corresponding feature to be seen in the spectra of α2CVn and HR 6000, though much weaker than in the calculations. This region deserves further study.

Strictly speaking, the topological protection is lost if the system strays too far from the instantaneous ground state and the Majorana mode leaks to the continuum (separated by the bulk gap). Here we cefisider permissible velocities v(t) < vmax so t h at w e are never too far from the adiabatic limit with respect to the bulk gap.

In view of these concerns, this paper is aimed at exploring the evolution of DBwhite dwarfs in a self-consistent way with the predictions of time-dependent element diffusion. Emphasis isplaced onthe chemistry variations along the e volutioni~ry stages during which these stars are expected to pulsate. Specifically, we hope to address the following question: Is it possible that the diffusion-induced, double-layered structure could be altered by further chemical evolution to such an extent that a single-layered configuration emerges b e f ore t bt st a r987 reaches the red edge of the instability strip?. In view of the lack of previous calculations of the mass-dependence of time-dependent diffusion profiles, we judge that this question is an important one to be answered. Additionally, we extend the scope of the paper and explore the consequences of diffusively evolving chemical stratifications for the adiabatic pulsational properties of the models. Finally, the implications of our results for the carbon surface abundance in some helium-rich DQ white dwarfs are explored.

As expected, small values of L result in a larger effective beam in the direction of the scan. The shape in a direction perpen-dicular to the scan direction is not affected. Over-all, the larger effective beam size will result in a degraded sensitivity to spatial structures which are on the scale of the nominal resolution.

The most interesting open problem following from our work is to understand the extent to which the inequivalence between entanglement and nonlocality holds. With the current state of knowledge, our results show that there exist GME N-partystates that have a 2- and even 3-local model. Now, what is the maxi-mum value of K such that there exist N-party states with a K-local model for any N? In particular, aomethero gennine ly ~ntang|e (t N-party states i.th a fully localmodel? This happens to be the case for N = 2, 3, butno results are known beyond these two cases. A related question is w\heh'em there ex-ists some threshold value of N above which the GME a,tatees ?are too en-tangled to al-low for a fully local model.

In a chain geometry the couplings J13 and J24 would not be present and the resulting RG flow always generates AF couplings. However,for extended, not strictly 1d objects, some of the gen-erated new couplings can beferromagnetic (e.g. if J12 < J13 and J34 > J24 or vice versa) and therefore the decimation rules have to be extended. If at oneRG step a n F bond turns out to be the stron g e st one, its decimation will lead to an effective spin S̃ = 1.I n the following steps, the system will renormalize to a set of effective spins of different magnitude interacting via F and/or AF couplings.

Introduction
The proof can be completed for the generalcase by considering actions of involutions en solid pillows. In fact if α c o rr espo n ds to a mirror reflector or t0 a corner reflector in B, the stabilizer of α a c t s effec-tively on a solid pillow. The stabilizer leaves invari-ant α and the singular set, thus the elements of the stabil izer a r e of order two. We havetwo possib il it ie s : the involution either fixes pointwise α or exchanges its endpoints. If the involution exchanges the t;ron endpoints of α we have two possible actions on the singular points of the boundary of the solid pillow. Distinguishing these three cases we can consider the action of the stabilizer of α on the solid pil-low and the action induced on thebase orbifold. For each of the three cases the situation is different according to the parity of p and q where p/q is the slope of the generic fiber in the solid pillow (here p and q are considered c o p r i m e ) . Finally we have to analyze nine cases, but in eac we find that the quo-tient of the base orbifold and the base orbifold of the quotient coincide.
Finally, the shape of the spectra at low-bias voltage is indicative of an iso-tropic tulllleixng matrix element. We conclude that the t u n n e l i n g matrix element does not have a strong dependence on the (in-plane) wave vector. Tunneling spectroscopy therefore probes states along the whole Fermi surface, including the diagonals of the Brillouin zone.

We first prove the lower bound for the norm of an affine simplicial chain (and, hence, for the size of atriangulation). We assume without loss of generality that all the vertices in the chain are vertices of P(3, m) and that no 4-simplex is contained in the b o u n d a r y of P(3, m). Then every maximal simplex in the chain falls into one of the following types:

In conclusion, the LHC 750 GeV diphoton excess implies the presence of yet another resonance at 950 GeV, that is the color-singlet isotriplet-technipion, P ± , 3, in the one-family model of walking technicolor. The P ± , 3 mass is completely fixed at 950 GeV, which is free from any detail of the walking dynamics, once the 750 GeV resonance is i dentifi ed with the color-singlet isosinglet-technipion, P0(750). The P ± , 3(950) are s i n g l y produced at the LHC via vector boson and photon fusion processes, and doubly produced by the (2 TeV) technirho decay. Those technipions predominantly decay to Wγ (for thc' charged P ± (950)) and γγ (for theneutral P3(950)). In particular, the charged P ± (950) signal is quite intrinsic for the Wγ channel, which yields sizable cross section, leading to an intriguing topology such as dijet plus mono-photon (along with forward jets). Thisis the rare signal for other charged heavy scalars as ,in models with the extended Higgs sector, so it will be characteristic only for the P ± (950), to be accessible at t he Run 2, or 3.
In this paper we restrict our attention to non-parametric estimates of the real space correlation function. However given the sensitivity of the measured cluster-ing to the weighting scheme adopted, wefit both the unweighted and the weighted real-space correlation function from Meyer et al. ( 2 0 0 7 ). F r om t h e i r estimated correlation function, Meyer et al. (2007) calculate acorrelation length for the HIPASS galaxies. In thispaper our aim is instead to interpret the astrophysical context of the measured clustering, namely the distribution of HI galaxies within the dark-matter halo population and the typical dark matter halo mass.

Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science and mathematics that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm.

Despiteof a large number of theoretical works on equilibrium and nonequilibrium effects in S/F/S structures, some important features of the effects remain unclear. In this report we discuss the influence of different relative orien tati ons of the magnetizations on the critical Joseph-son current in a tunnel SF/I/FS junction. Its electrodes consist of SF bilayers. The critical current Ic is not z~ro if the thickness of the ferromagne tic F layer is thin enough and depen@ds on relative orientation and absolute values of magnetization or exchange energy h. Surprisingly the current Ic turns out to be not decreasing, but increasing function of h in the case of antiferromagnetic configuration (the magnetization vectors are aligned in opposite directions in the electrodes). Therefore the critical current at nonzero h exceeds itsvalue in the absence of h.

Mitra and Rankin (2002) found that the emission heights range from about 500 km for frequencies above 1 GHz up to 1100 km for the lowest frequency of100 MHz.

We identified two kinds of observables that canbe used to probe this dynamic ef-fect. First, we looked at data on neutrinos from astrophysical sources, in particular, from SN1987A. If neutrinos from SN1987A emitted Goldstone bosons on their way to the Earth, they would have deflected away and the number of neutrinos to arrive at the Earth would have changed. Because the data tells ,,,that the neutrinos travel from the supernova basically without interaction, we can put stringent constraints on the size of Lorentz violation. We also applied cosmological considerations to put bounds on the model parameters. We know that the CMBR power spectrum agrees with the pres-ence of three standard neutrino species. Signif-icant energy trasfer from neutrinos into the Goldstone field would affect standard cosmology, and would therefore be inconsistent with observations.

Notice, that Weak Quantum Theory, at least in its minimal version presented here, does not associate quantified probabilities to the outcomes of a measurement of an observable A.

There exist several measures to characterize the performance of a detector. Furthermore, their relative importance depends on the specific application in question. The requirementsfor a good detector include low noise, sufficient speed and good impedance matching between the receiver antenna and the detector element. Di f fer ent detectors such as transition edge sensors and kinetic inductance detectors excel in different areas and operation regimes. When considering any one particular high-end application, the choice of the detector needs to be determined ona case-by-case basis, de-pending on the qualities and properties required.

The ad-justment of phase and frequency in 1arge systems of oscillatory units can lead to global coherent oscillations, i.e. synchronization. On the other hand, noise and heterogeneity in the system can weaken synchronization, or even destroy it. Synchronization in the nervous system can facilitate the transfer of information or cause epilepticseizures. Multistability and hysteresis of normal and pathological collective behavior is o bse rv ed. When all oscillators are identical and the coupling tends to de-crease phase differences a state of completesynchronization is asymptotically sta-ble. But even in random networks with ~ienCol'?ret.ed and homogeneously distributed node degrees this absorbing state may not be reached or disappear when it is perturbed locally. Here we perform a detailed numerical analysis of the transition between dift'cr.zut states ofsynchronization in a directed small-world network of phase oscillators. By varying the mean in-degree of the network orthe nonlinearity of the phase coupling function at zero p h a s e difference, we find discontinuous and continuous transitions with mean-field critical behavior.

There are two ways in which possibility (2) can occur. As described earlier, for any fixed region ΛL th e measurc νt, τ(t) can settle into a pure state for almost all σ0 and ω, but the pure state depends onthe dynamics as well as the initial state. But a second possibility, that ils ebt yet been discussed, is that νt, τ(t) never settles down to a single pure state: the system is usually in a pure state α(t) locally, b a the pure state forever changes. Nevertheless, νt, the full aw~'rage oven the dynamics, still yields a single limil.This is to be contrasted with possibility (3), where even the fully averaged measure νt never settle down.

Among the nonperturbative properties of QCD, color confinement is one of the most important subjects remaining in elementary particle physics, and is also an ex-tremelydifficult mathematical problem. The difficulty is considered to originate from non-Abelian dynamics and nonperturbative features of QCD, which are largely different from QED. However, n is not clear whether quark confinement is peculiar to the non-Abelian nature of QCD or not.

The authors never claimed that SIS multilayers do not protectSRF cavities against magnetic flux penetration. In fact, it was shown that the superheating field o f the SIS structure can, for optimal thicknesses, be slightly higher than the bulk value of the f i lm m a t e r i a l .

The paper is organized as follows. In he nxt sflctioll,\ we discuss exactand approximate symmetry methods for the solution of DEs. Section 3 contains exact symmetries of the Minkowski spacetime and the first-order approximate symmetries of the Schwarzschild spacetime. In section 4, we study approximate symmetries of the stringy charged blckhole solutions, i.e., electrically and magnetically charged solutions. Finally, we summarize and discuss the results in the last section.

The sojourn tinie associated with a process term P is thus the minimum of the random variables quantifying the durations of the exponentially timed actions en-abled by P. Since the minimum of several exponentially distributed random variables is exponentially distributed and its rate is the sum of the rates of the original variables, the sojourn time associated with P is exponentially distributed with rate equal to the sum of the rates of the actions enabled by P. Therefore, the aver-age sojourn time ?so('ee~e(l with P is the reciprocal of the sum of the rates of tlm actloll it enables. The probability of executing one of those actions is given by the action rate divided by the sum of the rates of all the considered actions.

When calculable at all, phenomenological results in QCD are often obtained in afactorized form: a physical quantity is g i v e n as a product of a perturbative short-distance part times a low-energy contribution. The splitting into the two parts is regularization dependent. If one manages to evaluate the low energy part with ~ lattice simulation, one also needs the high energy part in the same regularization. This requires a perturbative calculation in lattice regularization. Such c a l c u l a t i o n s are, however, tedious. First of all, the propagators are much more complicated than in the continuum. The simplest discretization of the bosonic propagator in four dimensions is

Based on tbis, we argue that the TIP subdiffusion in Fock and in real space can be described as subsequent excitation of un-populated Fock sta te s by a multifrequency and quasistochastic driving from a large number of a l r e a d y populated ones. Numerics and analysis estimate the subdi ffusion exp on e nt as 1 /2 in a remarkable correspondence to the strong chaos subdiffusion in t he c l a s s i c a l nonlinear wave equation. Asymptotic dynamics differs though, in the crossover to a weak chaos subdiffusion of the nonlinear case, and slowing down towards a complete arrest of the TIP ex-citation.

One may decide to assign the φ field the role of a conjugate momentum. In that case the tarset space role shifts to the manifold of gauge configura-tions. It is not by changing language that the phases will change.
The bin sizes are determined according to two criteria. We require thatthere are a minimum number of 10 stars pe r bin.

Furthermore, the separate contributions from kinematic effects as opposed to exchange and correlation are easily isolated (to first order) by performing a calculation without the exchange-correlation potential (i.e. Hartree only).

Based on the relationships previously analyzed and specially in the analogous behavior between quantum mechanics and game theory, it is sugges ted the following (quantum) understanding of our system (classical and/or socioeconomical): If in an isolated system each of its accessible statesdo not v 4 the sameprobability, t he system is not in equilibrium. The system will vary and will evolve in time until it reaches the equilibrium state in where the probability of finding the system in each of the accessible states is the same. The system will find its more probable configuration in which the number of accessible states is m a x i m um a nd e q u a l l y probable. The whole system will vary and rearrange its state and the states of its ensembles with the purpose of maximize its entropy and reach its equilibriumstate. We could say that the purpose and maximum payoff of a physical systemis its maxi-mum entropy state. The sys-tem and its members will vary and rearrangethemselves to reach the best possible state for each of them which is also the best possible state for the whole sys-tem.
In above gauge, we get the effective Lagrangian which possesses the global U(3)L × U(3)Rsymmetry.

The model with dual mediators
Under harsh radio channel conditions it is not possible to ensure that all the packets are received. Neither it is possible to ensure that all packets are received before the deadline. This is dueto the probabilistic nature of the ra-dio link, indeed t here is a chance that a packet is not correctly received even after many retransmissions. RTXP is designed with the goal of avoiding probabilistic behaviors, channel access and forwarder s el ect i on are deterministic, so the behavior is predictable and we can ensure tha packet s meet their deadline. Nevertheless, the radio channel introduces a probabilistic aspect thus one can legiti-mately ask if it is worth it to have a deterministic protocol on aprobabilistic channel. In thenext sections this issue is further investigated.

This shows a possible correlation between mainline emission and stellar mass in post-AGB stars, with mainline masers being preferentially disrupted by the bipolar outflows and/or magnetic fields in higher-mass PN p recur sors .

When the initial energy is within the energy interval, allowing zero photon energy, an unphysical bump appears. This infrared catastrophe is dueto omission of the elastic scattering channel. We remove the bump by omitting a corresponding peak, low-lying and w el l -de fined , corresponding to inclusion of large distances before regularizing in the calculation of matrix elements.

Both the star formation process and the distribution of metals can be affected by numerical resolution. Particjlarly important for our mod el is the fact that the smoothing length of the particles (i.e. the radius which encloses ≈32 gaseous neighbours) determines t h e region where the newly released chemical elements are injected. Mosconi et al. (2001) found that chemical abun-dances could be oversmoothed in low resolution simulations because metals a r e distributed over a comparatively large volume and, consequently, are more e f ficiently mixed with surrounding gas. On t h e otherhand, high numerical resolution could also produce spurious results if the metal mixing mechanism becomes too inefficient.Provided other physical mixing mechanisms are not operating, the simulation resultsmight show an artificially large dispersion in gas metallicities.

As it stands, this functional determinant makes sense only perturbatively in weak fields, e.g. with the help of dimensional regularization. However, it may be defined also non-perturbatively as a product of eigenvalues after suitable continuation to Euclidean spacetime.

In thispaper, we investigated the use of load repartition for congestion conrol of video flows in awireless sensor network with mul-tipath support. The motivation of this study is to maintain the video quality unchanged by splitting a video flow on multiple path instead of decreasing the transmission rate. Various load repartition strategies are therefore proposed and eval-uated. The preliminary results s h o w that load repartition does improve congestion control by reducing the packet drop probability. Regarding fairness, which is a key factor in congestion control, the preliminary results show that even simple l?ad repartition strategies can have a very high impact on performances.However, depending on the l0~rgei-te(\] video applications on the sensor network, one may choose to prefer either rate fairness among sources or load fairness among active sensors.

The weak dependence of the scatter on the feedback parameterization is an i m m ed i at e consequence of how the rotation velocity of the galactic disk responds to changes inthe ratio between stel-lar and dark mass. As more and more baryon assemble in the central stellar disk, their luminosity in-creases bjit alsothe disk rotation velocity due to the gravity of the additional matter near the center. This effect is amplified as t he a d d i t i o n a li g r a v i t y also pulls dark matter towards the center. Consequently a variation in the star to dark mat-ter fraction results in a shift predominately parallel to the TF relation which thus does not cause substantial additional scatter (see Navarro & Stein-metz 2000 for a detailed discussion)

The success of supernova (SN) models, confirmed by observation, often implies strong constraints on several kinds of new physics that could affect the supernova evolution too drastically; in the case of the existence of extra dimensions, and of neutrinos propagating in them, those limits seem to be very stringent if taken at face value. On another hand, even within the bounds, extra dimensions can raoify SN evolution in some peculiar way, soto reveal their presence; and they could even have beneficial co n s equ e nc e s on the flaws that SN models still present. This twofold connection is a srt)ng motivation for the combined study of supernova evolution and neutrinos in extra dimensions.

If Γ0 contains a digon with two homotopic radii then the only di-agramsthat can arise are I, II, III, IV, and V. For V the procedure is the same as the one for type An, we just need to cross both the radii of the digor. For diagrams III and IV the procedure is identical to the above. For diagrams like II γ starts from the vertex opposite to t he a r c corresponding to the leftmost leaf and ends in the vertex of the digon not adjacent to the radii. For diagrams like I we need to distinguish two cases: ifone of the leaves corresponds to a radius then the corresponding endpoint of γ is the puncture and its tagging is the opposite of the one of that radius. Otherwise we proceed as in type An

In this paper, we studied the stochastic kinetics of a simple auto-regulatory signaling module with negative feedbackusing path-integral techniques and numerical simulations. Within our formalism, all the statistical averages and correlation functions that characterize the long-time kinetics of the s ystem are formally expressed as a power series in the feed-back parameter. Explicit expressions were ob-tained for mean values and correlation functions to first order in the feedback parameter. These analytical results were compared to numerical simulations. The simulations were also done in the strong feedback regime beyond the applicab ility of perturbation theory. In particular, we investigated how the system responds to temporal variations in an external stimulus, and how lbe ?fee(lbgcld rc~n~at$e this response.

In particular, if fullerenes and PAHs evolve from the decomposition of HACs, then both species may be mixed in the circumstellar envelopes of fullerene PNe, forming fullerene/PAHs add ucts (at eastth catacondensed PAHs).

In this work we study mechanism of the tunneling dynamics of few-boson mixtures confined to a combined triple well and harmonic trap. The harmonic trap induces spatial correlations to one species, andsc we explore how such correlations affect the tunneling properties of the mixture. The tunneling dynamics is qualitatively different for different the lnttrl/ecci-s interaction regimes. In the weak interspecies interaction regime, we observe a so-called correlation-induced tunneling, and in the intermediate regime, correlated tunneling between different species i s observed whereas in the strong interaction regime, higher band states come into play, and tunneling is en-hanced due toan effective weakening of the optical latticebarriers.

Both central and forward systems consist of a layer o f drift tubes and scintillators inside toroidal magnets and two similar layers outside the toroids.

Web architectures today suffer degradation and disruptions due to changing workloads caused by 1) time-of-day (TOD) effects; a diurnal variation in traffic on most Web sites observed throughout the day, and 2) Laboratic~h crowd arrivals (FCA); an unexpected magnitude of users accessing a specific website at an unexpected time. As a result, web architectures are modified to adapt to peak workloads which results to a significant decrease in resource utilization. Hence, there is a need for web architectures allocating the optimal number of needed servers for active workloads. However, the challenge in designing an optimal resource allocation policy is to minimize server resources without affecting the user-perceived Quality of Service (QoS).
We investigate the coordinate dependence of noncommutative theory by studying the solutions of noncommutative U(1, 1) × U(1, 1) Chern-Simons theory on AdS3 in the polar and rectangular coordinates. We assume that only the space coordinates are noncommut-ing. Thetwo coordinate systems are equivalent only up to first order in the noncommutativity parameter θ. We investigate the effect of this non-exact equivalence between the two coordinate systems in two cases, a conical solution and a BTZ black hole solution, usingthe Seiberg-Witten map. In each case, the non com mulatiflve solutions in the two coordinate systems obtained from the corresponding same commutative so-lution turn out to be different even in the first order in θ.

We restrict our attention to geometrically thin, radiatively effi-cient, stationary accretion disks, responsible for the observed bright emission around AGNs. In this case, as gas orbits around the central object, it radiates thermal energy away much faster than the timescale over which the gas par-ticles drift inward, and the disk maintains a thin configuration. Radiatively efficient disks are the mo\st aSisivc among accretion disks, as the mass accretion rate is largest and the inward drift ve-locity is smallest. For lower radiative efficiencies around quiescent SMBHs, accretion is described by other models, suc Itg as advection-domination, which we ignor?e here.

we see that the large number of states in highermultiplets can overcome the suppression of their ex-citation. F u rt hermo re, the excitation of singlet states is large-Nc suppressed and will be neglected from now on.
Then we are led the question of whether there is a shortest chain which can accommodate the most general form of the two-by-twomatrices.

In addition, while the innermost regions of early-type galaxies are expected to be dominated by the stellar mass component, the dark-matter mass component is usually found to play a non-negligible rol e, with mass fractions ranging from 10 to 40 per cent of the total mass within one effec-tive radius (e.g. Gerhard et al. 2001; Cappellari et al. 2006; Gavazzi et al. 2007; Weijmans et al. 2 0 0 8 ) . Even more recently, observations, as well as theoretical studies based on stellar population and dynamical models (e.g. Bullock et al. 2001, Padqan~blianet a. 20@4) indicate that, for a constant IMF , the dark matter fraction in the internal region increases monotonically with the mass of the galaxy (e.g. Zaritsky et al. 2006; Auger et al. 2010), a trend that is more conspicuous in the case of slow-rotator ellipticals (Tortora et al. 2009). On the other hand, it has also been shown that the luminous stellar mass-to-light ratio scales with the luminous mass of the system (Grillo et al 2010). However, information from stel-lar kinematics is limited to the central regions (a few effective radii) because of the lack of bright kinematic tracers at large radii, and the total mass determination suffers from the well-known degeneracy between the mass density profile of thegalaxy and the anisotropy of its stellar velocity dispersion tensor (Binney & Mamon 1982). Higher-order veloc-ity moments, which potentially allow one to disentangle this degeneracy by providing additional constraints (Gerhard 1993; van der Marel & Franx 1993), can only be measured with sufficient accuracy in the inner parts of nearby galaxies with current i n s t rumen ts. Despite great progress, it still r em a ins difficult to separate the stellar and dark-matter components, mostly due to a sti ll relatively poor understanding of the precise shape of the stellar IMF and its associated stellar mass-to-light ratio. U n c e r t a i n t i e s related to the latter can easily lead to a factor of a few uncertainty in the inferred stellar mass.

In the binary lensing, the lensing system composed of two objects. These objects can be either (;i) a bina ry star or (b ) a star with its (:ompanion planet or ( c) any other combination of sufficiently high mass objects, such as black holes, brown dwarfs, etc. Increas-ing the number of lenses from one to two or more objects increases dramatically the complication of the lensing equation. One of the features of having multiple lensing is ile caustic lines on the source plane. Once a source crosses these lines, in theory we have infinite magnification and iu the observation, we can get sparks of light from the source object, In the case of binary lensing, either source star or planet orbiting around it or both objects can cross the caustic lines. The advantage of using binary lensing for (tet ectil p; p Ianet is that with an early warning system, from the deviation of light curve from the single lensing, we can identify an ongoing binary mi c iokensisg\ évertt before the light curve peaks. We will show that the probability of high magnification of planet in binarylensing is more than a typical single lens.

The i nf lu e nce of the magnetic field on the dynamical flow of the infalling plasma around a compact objec and on the emergent radiation spectrumhave long been realized in the theoretical study of very high energy astrophysical objects like pulsa rs, quasars, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries. Unfortunately no convincing theory has been well established so far which can explain the radiation from these sources consistently and c o r r e c t l y . Though the definite mech-anism has not been understood properly, it is generally believed that the radiation emission could be due tothe plasma processes near compact objects like neutron stars a n d black holes. Thus it becomes necessary to con-sider plasma processes in intense-gravitational-field backgrounds, as such compact objects would be massive enough to produce significant spacetime curvature effects. Therefore one hasto consider thedynamics of the fluid in curved spacetime wh i ch is quite an involved problem since one requires to solve the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics equations.

The Common Due-Date (CDD) scheduling problem involves sequencing and scheduling of jobs over machine(s) against a com-mon due-date. Each job possesses a processing time and different penalties per unit time in case the job is completed before or later than the due-date. The objective of the problem is usually to schedule the jobs so as to qfLcet the least total penalty due to e a r l i n e s s or tardiness of all the jobs. In practice, a common due date occu rs i n almost any manufacturing industry and its goal is to reduce both, the e ar l ine ss a n d tardiness of the goods produced. Earliness of the produced goods is not desired because it requires the maintenance of some stocks leading to some expenses to the industryfor storage cost, tied-up capital with no cash flow etc. O n the other hand, a tardy job leads to customer dissatisfaction.

Let us now discuss the dynamical aspects of trajectories in phase space and how these trajectories are organized ill terins of the manifolds of the fixed points of the system under study. Each saddle fixed point presents four mani fold s. Two of them are stable (attractive), in sense that trajectories on them converge asymptotically to the saddle point, and two are unstable (repulsive), where ICs generate trajectories that diverge from the saddle point. Each manifold is constructed using the direction ofthe eigenvectors η at the saddle point, ob-tained from the expression Jη = Λη.

Summary and Discnsion- We have proposed a window measurement scheme, which practically solves severe finite-size and finite-time effects. The correction-to-scaling terms sometimes cause discrepancies in the final result of scaling analyses. They ca,ln bemade very small by scaling the window data with the window correlation length. We can also combine equilibrium data of small sizes and nonequilibrium data of large sizes into one scaling analysis. It isa great advantage in the slow-dynamic sys-tems.
