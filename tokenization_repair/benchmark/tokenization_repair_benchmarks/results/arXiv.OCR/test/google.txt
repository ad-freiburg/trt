§ 2. The groupoid approach
This method to calculate the dark energy density is wrong. In this method, at the location of the observer, the sum of the vacuum temperature due to the matter and radiation at different locations is adopted.As shown already previously, this sort of sum of the vacuum temperature due to the matter and radiation is nonsense. With the above equation, the numerical result of α is about 1.2. As expected, it does not agree with the astronomical observations.

Every pure expression can be seen as a pr.opegaton and ev-ery propagator as a catcher. It follows that every expression can be seen as a catcher, so that the decoration (2) could be avoid-ed; however we often use it for clarity.
The form of the perturbation
We have shown that dust (specifically its morphology and amount) is linked with the properties of the radio source associated with the g?alax~. W(; can summarize our conclusions as follows:
where Nc is the color f  actor of the Feynman diagram and FS its symmetry factor. We note that within this approximation there is no interference effect between thegauge and contact amplitudes.
From the above proposition, we deduce that homogeneity and parallelizability are preserved under equivariant blowing up:
where F is an arbitrary continuous function on Q. Note that in the proof given above we need not continuity of these functions.

Thus, the quantum linear dynamics of  two-level system is equivalent to the classical dynamics of two coupled classical oscillators. This means that one can associate to two coupled classical oscillators the two-dimensional Hilbert space of states which formally is equivalent to the artificial spin-1/2 states.

There are many experimental instances in which this question makes sense because time seems to acquire an observable character. For example, we can think of the time of arrival of a particle in a detector, the t i m e of occurence of a specific event, or the tunneling time of a particle under the influ-ence of a potential barr?ier.
Our main aim in this paper is to propose a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm for finding polynomial roots, where we present a benchmark implementation of quantum non-unitary eigenvalue calculation scheme for polynomials.

Our analysis is consistent with the aforementioned results and goes well beyond them.Under reasonable assumptions, we not only determine the form of the relevant condensates generated by dynamical breaking for arbitrary d andG, but .find that for each type (complex, real, or pseudoreal) of representation of G carried by the fermions, the chiral symmetries of the massless Lagrangian,as well as the residual symmetries after dynamical breaking, exactly follow the pat-tern of Bott periodicity as the dimension changes. The consequences Vn.'this for the topological features of the low-energy effective theory of the Goldstone boson degrees of freedom are considered, including an analysis of the interpretation of baryons as topological solitons.
Several experimental results presented by other authors seem to show that odd/odd charge splits reach lower minimal excitation energy than the even/even charge splits do. However the presented cases correspond to odd/odd charge splits more asymmetric than the even/even charges splits. Therefore those results may be inter-preted by the Coulomb effect hypothesis. After this hypothesis the more asymmetric charge split will reach the lower minimal deformation energy. Moreover, there are case of even/even charge splits with higher minimal excitation energy than the odd/odd charge splits, but they also correspond to more asymmetric charge splits. Is short Coulomb effect seems to overshadow even-odd effects on minimal value of excita-tion energy.

The MD=rsiTDDPT simulation above leads to crucial insights into the exciton dynamics. However, it does not capture quantum properties of the vibrational environment such as zero-point fluctuations. At zero temperature all the atoms in the MD simulation are completely frozen. Moreover, similarly to an infinite-temperature model, a t long times of the quantum dynamical simulation the exciton is evenly distributed among all molecules, as we will see below. In order to obtain a more realistic description, we modify the stochastic simulation by introducing quantum jumps derived from the zero-point (zp)fluctuations of the modes in the vibrational environment. We refer to this corrected version of t h e MD propagation as QJC -MD.

Neutrinos are produced and detected as one of the three active neutrino flavors, which propa-gate as a super pos it ion o f all 4 mass eigenstates. A 4-by-4 unitary matrix U transforms between the flavor and mass eigenstate bases. In general, four flavor neutrino osc i ll a fion s are affected by 6 mixing angles and three CP violating phases. We make some assumptions to reduce the number of free parameters and sim-plify the analysis. We assume the neutrino masses to be hierarchical, with the heaviest mass eigenstate mostly sterile. We assume the sterile neutrino is a mixture of the 2 heaviest states only. We can then write the mixing m a t r i x as

The presence of a fault appears if making a minor local change, called a remedy, in the polinseq removes the errors that led to its identification without leading to any new errors. Judging the latter is by no means easy. Local changes to a polinseq may involve (i) the insertion of novel instruction to a polinseq, (ii) H OSPtrh(; removal of existing instructions from the polinseq,ad (iii) the modification of existing instructions within the polinseq. Each of these steps are instruction level modifications.
They first look for potential suffixes by searching for frequent word-final substrings. Then, they look for potentially morphologically related pairs, i.e., pairs that end in potential suffixes and share the left substring preceding those suffixes. Finally, they look, among those pairs, for those whose semantic vectors (computed using latent seman-tic analysis) are significantly correlated. In short, the idea behind the semantic component of their model is that words that tend to co-occur with the same set of words, within a certain window of text, are likely to be semanticallycor related words.

The proposed l)roto eoi is more efficient than an intuitive solution, that performs quantum teleportation and quantum remote ces t:lil roT separately in two distinct entanglements of quantum state. It should be noted that in the proposed protocol, Alice can only perform the rotation operator under  Z axis, and Bob can only teleport a single particle. How to dLe?sigl, a protocol for Alice to perform an arbitrary operator and Bob to teleport various quantum states is a promis-ing future research.

The interaction of planetary nebulae (PNs) with the interstellar medium (ISM) was first discussed by Gurzadyan (1969). Smith (1976) used the thin shell model to analyze the evolution of a spherically symmetric expanding PN shell moving through the ISM (see also Isaacman 197g,). On the observational side, only a few PNs showed interaction with the ISM (hereafter refereed t o as interacting PNs) until the last decade. With better observational imaging instruments (CCD amA)rO the field interacting PNs became more popular (e.g., Borkowski, " \ ['ks vetun ov, & Harrington 1993; Ja-coby & Van de Steene 1995; Tweedy, Martos & Noriega-Crespo 1995; Hollis et al. 1996; Zucker & Soker 1997). Borkowski, Sarazin & Soker (1990;hereafter BTreS} discuss the potential in using interacting PNs to probe the ISM, and list many interacting and p onss bly \iirter sc t ir lg; PNs. This lJst was extended in the review article by Tweedy (1995) and in the atlas of interacting PNs (Tweedy & Kwitter 1996). Tweedy with several collaborators has been leading the observational research in the field (e.g., Tweedy & Kwitter 1994a,b; Tweedy & Napiwotzki 1994). Other studies are in progress, and preliminary results were presented in the conference (e.g. Kerber et al. 2000; Dopita et al. 2000 ).
The acceleration of coordinate axes that are fixed in the laboratory frame, rel-ative to the ob-server co-moving with the test particle, is simply the opposite o f the test particle acceleration, since the laboratory frame is non-accelerating. Similarly, the relative ve-locity to the same observer of an ob-ject fixed in the laboratory frame is the opposite of the test particle velocity as observed from the laboratbrs 1"ralne. This results in an angular velocity of Thomas precession of the laboratory frame coordinate axes seen by the testparticle co-moving observer of

Several remarks are in order: to begin with, at least Eor the surfaces considered in this paper, the PFA becomes a well defined and controlled approximation scheme: the leading corrections are small when |∂αψ | ≪1 or, in other words, when the curved surface is almost parallel to the plane. Higher order corrections will be negligible when, in addition to this condition, the scale of variation of the shape of the surface is much larger than the local distance between surfaces. It is also clear that the corrections to PFA only contains local information about the geometry of the surface, and does not include correlations between different points of the surface.

Introduction
This work serves as a valuable learning experience and stepping stone to prepare HEP experiments for the next-generation Xeon-Phi-based supercomputers such as Cori. These new machines will be b u i l t with the KNL generation of Xeon Phi, though, which has significant design updates with respect to the KNC architecture used for these results. In particular,the difficulties with the tight memory constraints will be relaxed thanks to the increased memory capacity of the BNL cards. Also, the I/O implementation will likely change because the KNL cards are self-hosted and can write directly to hard disks op shared file systems. Houever, the parallel I/O mechanisms used in these results will still be the preferable way to save event data, so the overall scheme may look similar. New stadies will need to be performed w h e n the new Xeon Phi cards become available.
In the models we consider, every object has a type from a finite alphabet and a pose from a \[inite but large pose space. While classical language models generate sentences us~ing\ a, single deriva-tion, the grammars we consider generate scenes using multiple derivations. These derivations can be unrelated or Liley can share sub-derivations. This allows for very general descriptions of scenes.

We quantify this trap loss me c hai\ sm fr o?mmeaau re m e n tc oif the trapping times in an IP-type electrostatic trap with either a zero field or an offset field at the center, under otherwise identical conditions. Moreover, we measured the trapping times for three isotopologues of ammonia, namely 14NH3, 14ND3 and 15ND3. Th-ese molecules have subtle dif-ferences in their energy level structure, resulting in different probabilities for nonadiabatic transitions. Contrary to the theoretical expectations, the results demonstrate the enormous importance of trap losses due to nonadiabatic transitions even at the present 30 mK temperatures.

Abstract
Finally, for the pairwise statistics with lags, the KL-divergence for both the TC-RBM and the Dirichlet-VMM is low, very close to the one for the train data, whereas for the VMM it is considerably higher. This suggests that our pro-posed methods respect the short or-der statistics of the musical genre and are better than tile VMM in capturing the statistical regularities of the data through time.

Analysis of Majorana Neutrinos
For each setting of the spins of the colliding protons the differential cross-section in θl is controlled by the independent parameters D0, 1, 2, each of which contains infermat?ion about the parton distributions. To isolate information on the polarised d i s t ribu t ions, it is necessary to form asymmetries, either by reversing the spin direction of one of the protons with the other being unpolarised (single-spin asymmetries), or reversing the spin di-rection of one of the protons, the other being polarised (double-spin asymmetries).
Despite apparent similarities between the AIC and BIC, they answer different questions, as they are derived based on different assumptions. AIC tries to select a model that most adequately describes reality (in the form of the data under examination). This means that in fact the model being a real description of the data is never considered. On ~il contrary, BIC tries to find the true model among the set of candidates. Because BIC is more stringent, it has a tendency o; underfit, whil-e AIC,- as a more liberal method, is inclined towards overfitting. This leads sometimes to pointing different models by the two criteria, which happens rarely, but is due to the fact that they try to satisfy different conditions.

Generally, we can expect two competing rates. First is the characteristic root e l o n g a t i o n rate, directed downwards and secondis the evapotranspiration rate directed upwards. The latter can be divided into the transpiration and evaporation components. It is clear that the root elongation rate would ultimately depend on the evaporation conditions as water serves as a major limiting factor in its growth. At low humidity conditions, we expect the evapotranspiration rate to be faster, thus the developmjnt of the evaporation f r o n t , zsup also occurs fast. When this happens, the evaporating front, zsup, eventually catches up with the root tip and quickly exposes a large portion of the taLal root system to a (tiv zone. The appear-ance of the dry zone certainly decreases water absorption rates.
we let Dn, r denote the smallest positive integer such that Dn, rXn, r(x) has rational integer coefficients.
In this paper we report on our measurements of the meridional motions of the magnetic elements. We find variations in the strength and structure of the meridional flow that may help to explain in general how the polar fields are modulated and in particular how they were modulated during cycle 23. These variations may have contributed to the production of the weak axial dipole moment during cycle 23 which, in turn, caused the s m a l l a m p l i t u d e for cycle 24.

The analysis of the emergence of a classical behavior in a quantum system is a subject of interest not only from the conceptual but also from theapplicative point of view.Indeed, for the correct behavior of any quantum device it is surely relevant to understand under which conditions genuine quantum effects, like interference or entanglement, are reduced or cancelled.

In this work we take seriously the last possibility, and investigate the idea of introducing a modified MPP to predict the SM Higgs boson U?sx? from the requirement that our vacuum has only barely survived early cosmology (call it metastability MPP). We shall ask if there should be reasons that M PP ideas might after all lead to metastability MPP. Further we shall ask, phenomenologically, whether such a metastability MPP fits the data.
It appears that most of the remaining disagreements between ΛCDM predictions and observations could be (:dex\p~/u,e\dh by a lack of details in the Amodeling o f complex processes at the smallest scales. These are hard to control in numericai simulations. Hopefully, the increasing computingpower will soon allow onetoacilicvemore ac-curate numerical simulations and test if these discrepancies still remain. It is important to ee~.larak that no disagreement is left clau the broad, large scale description of the Universe, while the independent observations have flourished in the last few years,giving increased confidence in the validity of the ΛCDM paradigm.

This section will attend the intricate problem of learning the LDAG structure from a set of data. This poses some obvious problems due to the extremely vast model space as well as some additional not so obvious problems due to the f l e x i b i l i t y of the models. We introduce a structural learning mKtho that utilizes a non-reversible Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method combined with greedy hill climbing. Such a combination of a stochastic and a deterministic algorlthrn provides solid performance with a i'e souabe time complexity. A Bayesianscore is used to evaluate the appropriateness of an LDAG given a set of observed data. In order to prevent overfitting, we impose a prior distribution that allows us to balance the ability of an LDAG to match the available learning data with its complexity. We begin with some additional notations.

We fol-lowed a similar procedure to study the influence of recency and semantic context. In the case of tag recency, we calculated the days elapsed since the last use of i by u. In the case of the semantic context, we determined the tag co-occurrence value between i and the tags already assigned to the currently tagged resource r (i.e., t h e second component of the activation equation). Then, as in the case of tag frequency, we pooled together the tags of all users with the same recency or semantic context values and calculated the tag reuse probability for both factors.

In a distributed setting, any type of non-local resource that can be created by a quantum operation must also be consumed in order to perform the operation. Fora bipartite quantum operation, there are three such resources: aharedentangle ment E and classical communication in the Alice→Bob and Bob→Alice directions, which we shall denote ?by C → and C← respecuvely. We shall use the subscripts R and C to de-note, respectively, the minimum of the corresponding resource required to perform a quantum operation and the capacity of the operation corresponding to this resource. The entangling capacity is the maximum amount of entanglement that the operation can create. The classical capacity, in a given direction, is the maximum amount of clas-sical information that the operation can be used to send in that direction.

Our main focus is in distinguishing the possible phases of each model by us-ing the present experimental data both from the LHC and from dark matter experiments.

Suppose now that the beam is misaligned with the optical axis. Such misalignment can be introduced by slightly tilting one of the interferometer mirrors. The paths resulting from such n1isaleignments a?re rpmcs' eu?téd as red lines in Fig. 1. Let the transverse coordinates with respect to each aligned, unflded path, be written as x ( within the plane of the interferometer) and y (out of this plane). As can be seen i K J Fig. 1(c) and its inset, the effect of aDove prism along the path that includes mirror A is to reflect the mode in x around the optical axis, as well as to reverse the transverse momentum in that direction, kx, while leaving y and ky unchanged. Notice that the longer path length and extra inl;ernl reflection introduced by this prism will give an extra phase to thc photon. We compensate for this phase by putting other Dove prisms in the other two arms of the interferometer to r e b a l a n c e the path lengths,but weor\]\ieff\tthese at right angles to the first, so? that they act as parity operators in the y direction (i.e., out of the interferometer plane). This way, the paths resulting from mirror deflections in the interferometer plane will be essentially unchanged by these prisms, whereas out-of-plane deflections would be reflected about the op-tical axis. As we will now see, the insertion of the prisms changes the stability of the interferometer to mirror tilts.

It iscon-siderably more unc er tain i f the environments of quasars depend on their op-tical or radio luminosities, or on redshift. Early studies claimed that radio-loud quasars were located in richer en-vironments than radio-quiet quasars (e.g. Yee & Green 1984, 1987; Ellingson, Green & Yee 1991), but these findings have been contested in a number of recent papers (e.g. Fisher, Bahcall & Kirhakos 1996; McLure & Dunlop 2001; Wol\d-- et al 2001). Most studies have not found an~ relation between the optical luminosity of a quasar and its clustering (Brown, Boyle & Webster 2001; Finn, Impey & Hooper 2001), but there have been a number of papers claiming te existence of a correlation between radio luminosity and environment (e.g. Wold et al 2001; Finn, Impey & Hooper 2001). The studies of Yee & Green (1987) andEllingson, Yee & Green (1991) found th at high-redshift, radio-loud quasars were located in richer environments than low-redshift, radio-loud quasars, but more recent analyses (e.g. Wold et al 2001) fail to find any trend with redshift.

In summary, our results demonstrate that RIXS scattering from metallic Fe1.087Te exhibits theoretically predicted properties which can be understood in terms of the same Fermi threshold physics which influences absorption and photoemission lineshapes. In the fluorescence regime, we have identified an energy scale which appears to reflect material properties related to lattice vibrations. Our observations are significant because they constitute the first quantitative analysis of high-resolution RIXS in a metallic system. Future theoretical and experimental work using high resolution RIXS will help clar-ify the relative roles of Fermi liquid parameters including electron-hole pair lifetimes, momentum trans-fer, and exchange phenomena in determining how a photon scatters from a metal near an X-ray absorption edge.

This shows that the failure in reproducing an el;rnal classifica tio n may indicatea genuinely more complicated organization within the system, in addition to the lack of data or algorithmic mistakes. Besides developing sophisticated algorithms to deal with real systems, we should therefore keep in mind that some observed discrepancies may go beyond the standard classification and carry impo\rtant information about the system under study. Th-ese results warn us against the use of the no-tion of ground truth. Indeed, it may happen that what we consider as the ground truth is just one of the possible reference points, rather than some absolute truth. U n de r st a n d i ng t he i n for mat i on employed to define the so-called ground truth is therefore crucial in order to perform a proper comparison between external classification and automatically retrieved communities.

We suggest that part of the reason for this consistent shortcoming of the entire class of QMD-like models may be found in the fact that the model is effectively classical, since the equations of motion f \o. the wve packet parameters have been derived by a standard variational principle. The resulting description is then the dynamics of the wavepac k et centroids and tile inherent quantum fluctuations are neglected. The presence of quantum f l u c t u a t i o n s is signaled by the fact that the wave packets are not energy eigenstates. This basic feature sc nerlly causes the cc,e\ttla,tl(>u' value of the Hamiltonian to fluctuate in the course of time.

Both these statistics are minimized when θ0 is the maximum likelihood estimator of θ given x. Thus for B1 to be satisfied it suffices that the maximum likelihood est\imator of θ is well-defined and strictly monotone in x. B2 is satisfied when there exists a θ such that L(θ, x) is an asymmetric function of x. By definition, B3 is satisfied if there ex-ists an x0 such that L(θ, x) is :Increasing when x < x0 and decreasing when x > x0. This is guaranteed if Pθ has a monotone likelihood r-a(;la.

We were interested in three questions concerning the perturbations marks distributions. The first two questions are related to the tails and the symmetry of the data distribution. The third ques-tion is related to a more delicate problem. It is a well known fact that the perturbations locations follow an uniform distribution in K. Nevertheless, muchfew is known about the spatial distribution of the perturbations marks, except that they are highly dependent on their corresponding locations. So, the third question to be formulated is the following : do the dis-tributions of the perturbations marks exhibit a n y patten depending on the perturbation location ?

Each of the operon evolution models present a mechanism and fits a biological rationale to the observation that operons/gene blocks exist i extant tax COLa. Howcver these models do not readily allow us to quantify the changes between either operons/gene block or between different organisms. Moreover, more hsn one model can generally be applied to a chosen gene block and set of taxa. Therefore, there is a need to create a universally applicable method for charting gene block evolution. Having such a method on hand can help determine the specific evolutionary trajectory of any ,glprteu? gene block.

Similarly, a virtual link is called alternating, if along a branch of the link over-crossing always follow after under-crossing and under-crossing always follow after over-crossing. By switching some overpasses and underpasses, a virtual link diagram uch that its blunted Gauss diagram is orientable, can be made alternating. Vice versa, if, by switching some overpasses and underpasses, a virtual link diagram can be made alternating, its blunted Gauss dia-gram is orientable.

Our experimental tests show that for many test proteins, we only need to generate five different contact maps for a single protein in order to yield a contact map with much bet-ter accuracy than the first one and those generated by two popular EC analysis methods PSICOV a n d Evfold. This is especially true when the protein family under prediction has a small number of sequence homologs. This paper focuses on how to generate diverse M-best contact maps, but does not study how to re-rank them. A possible way to do so is that we may conduct protein folding simulation using each predicted contact map and then select the one resulting in the best protein 3D models according to some atom-level energy functions or model quality assessment methods.

We present an alternative approach to this experiment based on the average electric polarizability of a collection of molecules in response to an electromagnetic wave, an intrinsic property of the gas that depends on the electron cloud around the molecules. We show how the polarizability can be found from the intensity versus pressure data in the output of a Michelson interferometer. We updated the usual experiment apparatus by adding two sensors to the Michelson interferometer, an apertured light sen-sor on the output of the interferometer and a pressure sensor to the vacuum cell, in order to measure the output intensity as a function of pressure. Finally, we show how the refractive index of air can then be calculatne from tile polarizability for a given pressure and temperature.

Note that the pairing generated by the Gale-Shapley algorithm is male optimal, i.e., every man is paired with his highest ranked feasible partner, and female-pessimal, i.e., each female is paired with her lowest ranked feasible partner. It would be the reverse, of course, if the roles of male and female participants in the algorithm were interchanged.

Proof Since G has involutive coinverse, every standard solution ju is antiunitary. If all the quantum dimensions of ni)eCtral irreducibles u had subexponential growth, the associated Ju would be antiunitary by Theorem 4.8., hence the invariant state would be a trace by Theorem 3.1.
We first studied the p h o t o - induced r i n g - o p e n i n g process of the oxirane molecule. Through a ground state scan along the rc'activeC(~O angle of an oxirane molecule followed by TDDFT calculations (vertical excitations), a profile of several low-lying adiabatic excited state curves on which the excited state driven reaction may be car-ried can be constructed. However, these adiabatic excited state curves ranked by energies do not give us very much knowledge on how the reaction will proceed. We stress that the reaction process can be made much clearer if the excited state potential energy curves are labelled according to their excitation character instead of their energies. We demonstrated that the transition vectors of these low-lying excitations are dominated by the f i r s t NTO electron-hole pair (NTO1), and therefore the transition origins of NTO1 can be used to represent the character of these excitations. Based on this approach, we have successfully located several special geometrical points along the scanned CCO coordinate where the transition origins of two adiabatic excited state curves switch. By reconnecting the adiabatic excited state energy points (calculated by TDDFT) based on transition origins instead of energetic order-ing, we are then able to depict how the excited state-driven ring-opening process can proceed. This picture is u\s{l,('llldm with the previous excited state molecular dynamics study that found that the population of the 1(n,3pz) state facilitates the ring-opening process, while the population of 1(n,3s) state does not. We have demonstrated that the 1(n,3pz) state exhibits a monotonically-decreasing energy curve along the widening CCO angle, leading to a ring-opening reaction. For more complicated reactions with sev-eral coordinates involved and geometry strongly distor~ed,more geometries may be used, e.g. those from an excited state scan and molecular dynamics simulation, to help identify the photo-driven reaction pathways of interest. A promising future direction could be to apply this methodology to larger molecules with much more complex reaction pathways.
Once each of the calibration parameters is determined and the conversion from ADC counts to photoelectrons is well defined, the calibration with muon ring can be carried out.

It is obviously that to find a pair of points with a minimum distance between them is a difficult and massive operation. Therefore, construction of a cluster on just found pair is unprofitable. It is necessary to process a large number of minimal pairs. However, because of this after processing of the next pair and after unification of two clusters, some of the next pairs will already exist in the joint cluster. Thus the num-ber of united clusters will be significantly less than the number of selected pairs. The nu m ber of simultaneously processed pairs is set up by user. Of course, it will be easier to finish the clusterisation process in the first pass, but in this case a lot of minimal pairs willbe not  used because they are in another cluster and computational re-source will be wasted.

Integrating out the mediators at the scale Λ generates what we call SMχ EFT,containing only χ and the whole SM field content as its degrees of freedom. Many explicit realizations for LUV exist in the literature, and they can all be matched onto the SMχ EFT at the cutoff scale Λ. The regime of validity of this EFT extends all the way down to the EWSB scale, where the heavy EW states (W, Z, h and t-quark) have to be integrated out and the residual gauge symmetry is SU(3)c × U(1)em. For this reason we employ a d i f f . r e - nt E FT i f b e l ow t in E W SB s c a l e, with ou ly a SU(3)c × U(1)em gauge symmetry and 5 quark flavors, which we call EMSMχ EFT (where EMSM stands for SM with only electromagnetic interactions). In the remaining part of this Section we give a basis of independent operators for both EFTs up to mass dimension 6, as well as a prescription for how to match SMχ EFT onto EMSMχ EFT at the EWSB scale.

SUMMARY
One of the goals that we have in mind in the present paper is to investigate the conditions under which a scenario with positive curvature may mimican accelerating flat universe at low redshifts. This idea allows us to determinate the exact contribution of the scalar field Q (together with the curvature term) that gives rise to an effective cosmological constant term. In this way we obtain an effective cosmo-logical scenario l;hat coincides with the accepted ΛCDM model.
We also note a false positive (a pedestrian being de-tected as  anomaly) in the last image of column (b). Upon further investigation, this false positive was due to the fact that the cells in the region of the pedestrian had minimal or no activity during the training phase. Consequently any foreground object entering this zone during testing was considered as anomalous, irrespective of the observed features.

The Fock space we adopt to descr ibe the matter fields provides a simple platform to describe matter coupled to either finite (discrete) or continuous gauge groups, including truncated ones. In particular, we require that the internal degrees of freedom of the fermions provide a sufficient number of s t a t e s torealiz+, the smallest faithful representation of the considered group already at the single-particle level: the single-particle Hilbert space associated to a matter site must have dimension equal to that of the de-sired representation of the gauge group, usually the fundamental ,,ne.

Future work will include more complex tasks and signals, better modeling of the teacher, and improved processing techniques.

Our purpose of this paper is to elucidate the relation between the set of homoclinic points and the set of recurrence points, and to know the existence of the chain recurrence points. In the both themes, we want to maintain the volume-preserving (or symplectic) dynamics, but to drop the genericity assumption. Since the symplectic diffeomorphisms are automatically volume-preserving, our results in the paper is applicable to the symplectic dynamics ae well.
Fortunately, the transitional case occurs only for a very small spatial region, and can usu-ally be safely ignored. In these proceedings we have simply transferred from the adiabatic to the nonadiabatic regimes, skipping the transitional regime altogether.

In this work we apply nuclear EDF to a study of the formation and evolu-tion of cluster states in nuclei. The framework of nuclear EDFs and the role of spatial localization of the i n d i v i d u a l single-nucleon states is re-viewed in section II. Section III presents an analysis of the role of deformation and pronounced level degeneracy on the formation of clusters, and includes a number of examples of cluster structures in ex-cited states. Cluster phenomena and molecular bond in neutron-rich nuclei are discussed in section IV, and section V contains a short summary and conclusion of the present study.
Note that since 1 < a0 there are no singularities in the foregoing expressions. From the conditions a0 > 1 and y < 1 one observes that Py0 and Pφ0 are both positive while σ0 may be positive, negative or zero. Fig. 1 displays σ0 in terms of a0 and y We observe that for δ > 1 there exists regions that σ0 becomes positive. This is seen clearly in Fig. 1. Also in the interval on which σ0 ≥ 0 the weak and strong energy conditions are satisfied.

ABSTRACT: Since 1988, the United Nations, through the Programme on Space Applications, is supporting the establishment and operation of regional Centres for Space Science and Technology Ednca~it,n /n Africa, Asia and the Pacific, L at i n America and the Caribbean, and Western Asia. Simultaneously, education curricula have been developed for remote sensing and geographic information system, satellite communications, satel-lite meteorology and glob i 3l climate, and space and atmospheric science. The paper reviews briefly these developments and highlights the most recent updated education curricula in the four disciplines that are made available in 2002, in the six official languages of the United Nations, for implementation at the regional Centres and beyond.
§ 0. INTRODUCTION
Binning is essential in the case of spectroscopic observations of the stellar kinematics. In fact a mmimum S/N is required for a reliable and unbiased extraction of kinematical information from the spectra (e.g., Rix & White 1992; van der Marel & Franx 1993; Kuijken & Merrifield 1993). For this reason bin-ning is invariably used to analyze onc-dmensional (1D, og., long slit) spectroscopic observations. New developments with Integral l)'~e\]d Spectroscopy (IFS; eg.,n OASIS on CFHT,SAURON on WHT, VIMOS on VLT, GMOS on Gemini) require methods to perform spa-tial binning of spectra in two dimensions (2D) too.

In the next phase, we select for every virtual address α ∈ {0, 1} two landmark nodes xα · 0, xα · 1 from the connected sub-network Gα. Here α · 0 and α · 1 is the extension of α by symbol 0 or 1, respectively. Landmark node xα · 0 is one of the nodes of network Gα that has maximum ω-distance to xα in sub-network Gα, and landmark node xα · 1 is one of the nodes of network Gα that has maximum ω-distance to xα · 0 in sub-network Gα. A node u of Gα whose ω-distance to xα · 0 is les~ than or equal to the ω - distance between u and xα · 1 gets virtual address α · 0. It gets virtual address α · 1, if the distance between u and xα · 0 is greater than the distance between u and xα · 1.

where pr and pθ stand for the canonically conjugated momenta of r and φ0 respectively. Besides, we have assumed that the level of reference for the potential energy is z = 0, and the constant value of gravity is denoted by g. As the coordinate θ does not explicitly appear in H, θ I \ s a hidden variable and from the equations of motion we deduce that pθ is a constant of the motion. Physically this is clear because there are only two forces acting on the particle, one bcln9 gravity and the other the force of reaction exerted by the surface which is perpendicular to the surface. Thus, both forces are located in the vertical plane formed by the OZ axis rd *hc posJion vector of the particle, and therefore the momentum of these forces is always horizontal and hence the vertical component of the angular momentum 16 conserved. In other words pθ is a constant. In consequence, we define l,he effective radial potential energy U(r)for this problem as

The Introduction
We are interested in whether matchings are sta-ble,and whether there exist stable matchings given a particular matching game G. In general, a matching is stable if no subset of agents has any incentive to reorganize and form new matchings amongst themselves. We distinguish between three standard stabil-ity concepts which commonly appear in the matching literature. The first, setwise stability, is the most general and encompasses the other two (coex vise stability and pairwise stab'ility). Unless otherwise noted, the stability concept used in this paper is setwise stability, whi,ch we interchangeably refer to as set stability.

A further result of A92b is that, in order for shocks to exist, the curvature of the x1 orbits at apocenter must exceed a certain quantity, or in other words, the orbits that are elongated along the bar should be sufficiently peaked or have loops at their apocenters. Furthermore, in order for the shock loci lo be offset towards the leading side of the bar, the x2 orbits must not only exist, but also have a sufficient extent.

Conclusions
Anecdotal evidence and visual examination of some galaxies suggest that chaotic gas inflows often result in mis-alignments of newly formed stellar disks with previous stellar disk/non-spherical bulges, and t h e orbital planes of infalling satellite stellar or gas clumps do not always have a fixed orientation. These processes cumulatively may be thought to create s t e l l a r distributions in the central regions that are dynamically hot, which, in turn, provides conditions that are unfavorable to secular fomation o? stellar bars. We check if this indeed is the case.

The three ready brain components are zero at tob, and thereafter receive current from the corresponding component in the first row of eq. 2. That current is due to the physiolog-ical interaction that occurs when the observer interacts ( e .g. , visually) with the apparatus.
From the flavor pre-analysis to dark matter scenarios
Comparative data, while an integral and powerful tool in evolutionary biology, sometimes holds only limited information about the evolutionary process.

In this section we consider the dispersion phenomenon in a 2 - d i m porous medium domain, which is ob-tained by intersecting a 3-dim uniaxial porous medium with a plane that is parallel t(> the\ uniaxial axis. In the resulting 2-dim porous medium domain, there are two mirror lines, which are perpendicular to endt other. By these symmetry el-ements, it is easy to recognize the dihedral point symmetry group D2, which is one of ten 2-dim point symme-try subgroups ol' O(2).
From there, the problem becomes the classical Lyapounov-Levy-Feller Theorem. And we have the following conclusion :

One distinguishes different β-decay transitions also by thetr forbiddenness, or the degree of suppression of the quantum mechanical amplitude that describes the process. This sup-pression is determined by factors of three small q~nand,titIne~: R/λ, vN and αZ, which are the ratio of the nuclear radius and the de Broglie wavelength of the leptons, the velocity of the decaying nucleon in units of c, and the fine-structure constant times tha? charge of the daughter nucleus, respectively. Factors of R/λ come from the leptons carrying away orbital angular momentum (corresponding to higher order terms in the multipole expansion of the lepton wave functions). The quantities vN and αZ originate from relativistic and Coulomb effects, respectively.

We observed V2275 Cyg beginning on HJD2452930.61 (2003 Oct 18) with the 1.8-m Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT). This was 790 days after maximum light. Observations continued the next night starting at HJD2452931.59. The CCD was binned 2×2 providing a scale of 0.4 arcsec/pixel. V-band exposures were 120 seconds wl\th 30 second readout time covering about 10 hours over the two nights. The resulting images were bias subtracted and fl~t-fi('.ldedand intrunlnental C,A),magnltd?e. were measured using aperture photometry. Three comparison stars near the nova (Figure 1) were also measured and their positions ,is\ted in Table 1. Approximate V-band magnitudes for the stars were estimated from zero-point and air mass coefficients measured at the VATT o,n earlier r u n s with standard magnitude errors estimated to be ±0.05 mag.

Only in some galaxies there is some kinematics evidence that (part of) the H i may have be?enaccreted recently. Fore 'xample,- in the galaxies NGC 802 (Sadler et al. 2000) and NGC 855 (Walsh et al. 1990), part of the H i is in a polar ring-like structure.

We are able to reproduce here all the above mentioned ef?\cts with a classical model for an extended object, regardless of the soliton dynamics. In the next scction we show that a simple classical model exhibits the same behavior as the soliton. It can be trapped and reflected by an attractive well. The system will also show chaotic behavior.

In addition, to remove the dependence on choice of the reference fiber, the Dehn twists are thought of as elements of the mapping class of an abstract surface S. This requires the choice oNSf an identification diffeomorphism and induces an equiv-alence relation on the set of mapping class group factorizations: global conjugation. It is defined as

In this experiment, as in our previous experiment and the flight experience, room-temperature annealing increases the CTI of the CCDs.

If φ(x; y) is a formula, then we let φopp(y; x) denote the opposite formula: φopp(y; x) = φ(x; y), but the roles of variables and parameters are reversed. Hence a φ-type over A is a type in variable x and a φopp-type over A i s a type in variable y.

The response of the coronal magnetic ?tc1? to the photospheric activity patterns can be diagnosed in a simple way by calculating extrapolated potential-field source-surface (PFSS, Altschuler and Newkirk 1969, Schatten et al. 1969) models using the NSO and WSO synoptic maps as lower boundary conditions. Low in the corona, the magnetic field is sufficiently dominant over the plasma forces that a force-free field approximation is generally applicable. More-over, for large-scale coronal structure the effects of force-free electric currents, which are inversely proportional to length scale, may be neglected. A potential-field model for the corona must satisfy,

In this variational principle, the specific variables to hold f i x e d depend on the first law. The appropriate area to hold fixed is that of the apparent horizon, which is determined by the spatial geometry alone (unlike the event horizon, which is a global spacetime property). The apparent hoiizc,n generally lies in-side the event horizon, and coincides w i t h it for a static or stationary spacetime.

This result is useful in the approximate computation of multi-ple integrals over S. Together with further results of this paper it allows us to give error bounds of the cubatures of the form of a conical combination of the values of an integrand at some points of S. These error bounds depend on th ?,e second order differential of the function involved.
Tunka-Rex is a digital radio array for the detection of air showers in Siberia. Besides determining the precision and overall benefit of a radio detector in com-bination with an air-Cherenkov detector, its goal is to determine the absolute scale of radio emission. Therefore, we performed an absolute calibration with a commercially available reference source, reaching an accuracy for an individual amplitude measurement of 22%, including 18% uncertainty on the absolute scale. The same reference source was also used by LOPES and LOFAR. These three experiments now have a consistent amplitude calibration. Comparing the measured amplitudes to the predictions of the simulation code CoREAS, we find agreement within the uncertainties. Therefore, Tunka-Rex confirms the applicability of CoREAS for the simulation of absolute amplitudes of radio emission by air show-ers. It also provides a measure of the absolute scale ofsu radio amplitudes in its frequency band.
We observed Fairall 9 with the Suzaku X-ray Telescope. The 168 ksec run started on 2007 June7 at 3:34:52 (TT). The data were taken using the XIS and HXD detectors, using the XIS pointing position. The three XIS CCD cameras (XIS0, XIS1,and XIS3) cover C.2-12.0 keV while the HXD/PIN covers lhe 100-0#.0 keV band. The XIS data were taken in both 3x3 and 5x5 binning models. Exposures made us-ing the 3x3 mode lasted 150 ksec while the 5x5 exposures lasted approximately 18.5 ksec. The HXD/PIN detector ran in default mode with an exposure time of approximately 136.5 ksec.

As all faces have 1)ositivc circulation in clockwise direction,the total sum remains nonzero.

Since, circulation of this face is 2UTi, contribution from this component will surpass the total sum of all the subtrees where C passes through.
We express our gratitude to the invited speakers Jetty Kleijn and CosimoLaneve for their very interesting talks. The first talk presents similarities and differences between Petri nets and membrane systems, and how to enhance the Petri nets in order to faithfully model the dynamics of the bi-ological phenomena represented by membrane systems and reaction systems. The second talk deals with reversibility in massive concurrent systems; reversible structures for massive concurrent systems are intro-duced and stud-ied, and an equivalence on computations that abstracts away from the order of causally independent reductions is defined.

Conclusion
Astronomers in both camps can take heart in the fact that there are many more bright lenses waiting to be discov-ered. By way of illustration, there are some 5500 quasars brighter than B = 18.5 in the7500 square degrees o f the Hamburg-ESO survey (Wisotzki et al. 2000). Imaging these at high resolution should yield (in addition to the six already found) roughly 18 as yet undiscovered lenses for a conser-vative, Einstein-deSitter model. Whether by brute force or elegance, gravitational lenses will give a competitive value for H0.

In summary, while the arguments are admittedly vague and they do involve a certain level of guess, trial and error, the presented parametrization offers a good chance that with furt l6r rdstictions on the parameters a two-spin interaction Hamiltonian can be obtained.

Instead of just comparing the robustness, after the r e m o v a l of all of the edges, we would like to study the behavior of the attacks after only a few strikes. To do so, we define a variant of the R-index which takes into account only the first n strikes of an attack. Thus,for a simul-taneous attack (where the nodes are s.allk(:{t by a metric only once at the beginning), the Rn-index is defined as:
In conclusion, we have proved that the condition of positivity in addition to the linearity and the hermitian-preservation completely excludes all th u i t ab p o ss i b le maps to ol lc rr e l a te dl y clone a phase-set of states for all φ probabilistically. Since quantum operations satisfy the linearity, the hermitian-preservation, and the positivity at least, our result means that it is impossible to uncorrelatedlyclone a phase-set of input states for all φ probabilistically in quantum mechanics.

The study of zeros of partition functions, initiated by Yang and Lee, provides an important qualitative and quantitative tool in the study of critical phenomena.

In order for a solver to take account of stability, it wou.1doneedtu model both the cost of enacting a candidate config-uration, and the benefit gained by doing so. To take account of robustness, the solver would need to be able to predict the likelihood of future events, and be able to model the impact of the reconfigurations required by those events.
At first,the Watcher merely displayed alarms and informed people of problems. This service was very valuable, but we soon realized we needed more. For example, if the telescope stopped moving during a slew or track, the watcher would clearly indicate that the telescope had stopped moving, but not always why it had stopped. Because the SDSS telescope is highly-interlocked to protect it, its instruments, and its users, there were many root causes that might cause the telescope to stop moving. Since the Watcher already had access to all the low-level interlock signals, we added the interlock logic within it, thereby making it possible for t h e Watcher to indicate the root cause of all in-terlock-driven problems as well as the problems themselves. Thus, the Watcher became not only a problem notification tool, but also a problem diagnosis tool. It is unclear which mode was most valuable. Both were needed and relied upon extensively.

We have shown that by using an Autoencoder to initialise the temporal weights of aTRBM, form-ing what we call a TARBM, a significant performance increase can be achieved in modelling and generating from a sequential motion capture dataset.

Additionally, the evolution of the learned temporal filters are easily interpretable and help to better understand how the model represents the trained da-ta.

Flat-Field coefficients are used to determine the inhomogeneity between the different pixels.

Flat-field runs are performed as often as possible when the weather does not allow observation runs.

Python, however, is a general purpose programming language, while R is generally limited to tasks within the realm of statistical computing. With Python, students learn aii~i bu~ld confidence using general programming concepts that are common amongst other popular programming languages such as Java, C, or C++. The course also differs from typical introductory computer science courses that emphasize program design, as we integrate general programming concepts with an emphasis on data preparation, processing, and presentation. Moreover, data-intensive computer science courses, such as a machine learning course, often have one or more programming classes as a prerequisite, whi\ch becomes a barrier to enroll-ment for students in some f i e l d s , such as the social sci-ences. Our course has no prerequisites, and students are not expected to have any programming experience.

The simplest hypothesis is that there is a coeval burst of star formation in a cluster after which the stars themselves blow winds to make the bubble and eventually die as supernovae. This hypothesis is especially interesting because it implies that if the γ-ray bursts that go off in the low density environments are, in fact, within such self-generated bubbles (cf. points 1 and 2 of § 3), then the stars that produce the γ-ray bursts are not the most massive stars. Some stars must already have evolved with strong winds and perhaps died to blow a sufficiently low density bubble. This raises the possibility of placing an upper limit on the progenitor mass of γ-ray burst progenitor stars.

From there, a local mail server (i.e.,sendmail,but a felnsgste, mail server could also be used) is called upon to send an SMTP message out to an arbi-trary email address. This message could just contain the recorded keystrokes, but it is also possible to include the GUWMANET/GUWAL headers in order to tunnel the protocol over HTTP/TCP/IP (circumventing corporate firewalls), and to extend the covert acoustical mesh network to an-other covert network at any place in the world. The attacker has to be (directly or indirectly) connected to the Internet in order to perform this poccdue , but messages could also be gathered and sent out as s o o n as Internet access is established. Sending out gath-ered keystrokes to a local SMTP server and forwarding them to a re-mote email server has been successfully performed in the previously defined experimental setup.

To estimate the other terms one proceeds similarly. For example,
where the second inequality uses the elementary inequality
fors > 4m2π; for other val-ues of s, Hππ(s) can be obtained by an-alytic continuation.

Let (Up,p ∈ I be an open contractible covering of N by open subsets. We denote by θp the restriction of θ to Up, and (up1, ..., upn) a basis of the restriction of the dual of V to U,we have:

Results of the paper show that, in general, the I’rohleln 1 (see section 2 ) is very difficult. For example, I do not have any deep result abou t exact value of r0 (see Problem 1).
Another in-teresting Higgs boson de-cay channel to explore is an invisible decay, which is vanishingly small in theSM. The interest to this channel is driven by the fact that in many SM extensions the Higgsboson serves as a por-tal to dark matter (DM) sect or, i.e., it is expected to couple to DM particles (χ) and if they are light enough, it could decay invisibly via H → χχ.

Assume now that the player always stands on 18. If he decides to get another one or two cards, we get that the probability of 18 or better score is equal to 0.514, i.e. it is again less than the prob-ability of the same score if he changes on 14.
The coexistence of TSSs and 2DEG states is a very exotic example in a viewpoint of surface physics and have potential applications in the field o f nanoscale spintronic devices, s o the under-standing of their origin and properties is essential in this TI physics. However, the newly developed 2DEG has a complex spin-orbit-split electronic structure, which could be an obstacle depending on the way how to implement TI-based devices. For example, when we want i;o use an electric current through only the TSSs inBi2Se3 or when we want to make an n-type TI-metal junction whose current channel is only TSSs, those 2DEG states are definitely to be removed. In spite of these prac-tical needs, all reports on the effects o f adsorbates or surface impurities on Bi2Se3 surfaces have only shown that the 2DEG states are easily formed by various kinds of adsorbates in apr ultra-high vacuum, but have not suggested a possible way to remove the developed 2DEGstates with-out killing the TSSs.

During the run-up to the IAU General Assembly in Kyoto, i.e. the period May-August 1997, several groups around the world participated in a collaborative experiment in star cluster evolution. The aim was to study til evolution of the same clustcr. by several different techniques. The initial specification of the clu st e' r was as follows:

We have demonstrated a novel stereo vision algorithm for high-frame rate detections of obstacles. Our system is capable of quickly and accurately detecting obstacles at a single disparity and u sin g a state-estimator 1:o update the position of obstacles seen in the past, building a full, local, 3D map.It is capable of running at 120fps on a standard mobile-CPU and is light-weight and robust enough for flight experiments on small UAVs. This system will allow a new class of autonomous UAVs to fly in clutter with all perception and computation onboard.
