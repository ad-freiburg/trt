§ 2. The groupoid approach
This method to calculate the dark energy density is wrong. In this method, at the location of the observer, the sum of the vacuum temperature due to the matter and radiation at different locations is adopted. As shown already previously, this sort of sum of the vacuum temperature due to the matter and radiation is nonsense. With the above equation, the numerical result of α is about 1.2. As expected, it does not agree with the astronomical observations.

Every pure expression can be seen as a propagator and every propagator as a catcher. It follows that every expression can be seen as a catcher, so that the decoration (2) could be avoided; however we often use it for clarity.
The form of the perturbation
We have shown that dust (specifically its morphology and amount) is linked with the properties of the radio source associated with the galaxy. We can summarize our conclusions as follows:
where Nc is the color factor of the Feynman diagram and FS its symmetry factor. We note that within this approximation there is no interference effect between the gauge and contact amplitudes.
From the above proposition, we deduce that homogeneity and parallelizability are preserved under equivariant blowing up:
where F is an arbitrary continuous function on Q. Note that in the proof given above we need not continuity of these functions.
The experiments give:
The 12V power supply comes from an additional power connector, which accepts a standard 4-pin connector for hard-disk units. In addition to the 2.5V supply, GRAPE-6A requires 3.3V and 5V supplies as well. For these, the supply through the PCI connector is sufficient.

Then, there exists a point ξ ∈ X such that g(ξ) = ξ, that is, a fixed point of g.
Thus, the quantum linear dynamics of two-level system is equivalent to the classical dynamics of two coupled classical oscillators. This means that one can associate to two coupled classical oscillators the two-dimensional Hilbert space of states which formally is equivalent to the artificial spin-1/2 states.

There are many experimental instances in which this question makes sense because time seems to acquire an observable character. For example, we can think of the time of arrival of a particle in a detector, the time of occurence of a specific event, or the tunneling time of a particle under the influence of a potential barrier.
Our main aim in this paper is to propose a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm for finding polynomial roots, where we present a benchmark implementation of quantum non-unitary eigenvalue calculation scheme for polynomials. This specific task represents the least complex eigenvalue, which the algorithm can be fruitful without too much concern over the complexity.

We have used the current known data of KBOs to study their size distribution. We found that there is a peak around 230 km and therefore the size distribution is unlikely to be described by one single power-law. What does this observational result imply?
Our analysis is consistent with the aforementioned results and goes well beyond them. Under reasonable assumptions, we not only determine the form of the relevant condensates generated by dynamical breaking for arbitrary d and G, but find that for each type (complex, real, or pseudoreal) of representation of G carried by the fermions, the chiral symmetries of the massless Lagrangian, as well as the residual symmetries after dynamical breaking, exactly follow the pattern of Bott periodicity as the dimension changes. The consequences of this for the topological features of the low-energy effective theory of the Goldstone boson degrees of freedom are considered, including an analysis of the interpretation of baryons as topological solitons.
Several experimental results presented by other authors seem to show that odd/odd charge splits reach lower minimal excitation energy than the even/even charge splits do. However the presented cases correspond to odd/odd charge splits more asymmetric than the even/even charges splits. Therefore those results may be interpreted by the Coulomb effect hypothesis. After this hypothesis the more asymmetric charge split will reach the lower minimal deformation energy. Moreover, there are case of even/even charge splits with higher minimal excitation energy than the odd/odd charge splits, but they also correspond to more asymmetric charge splits. Is short Coulomb effect seems to overshadow even-odd effects on minimal value of excitation energy.

Concluding remarks
The joint density of X0 and U is given by
The MD/TDDFT simulation above leads to crucial insights into the exciton dynamics. However, it does not capture quantum properties of the vibrational environment such as zero-point fluctuations. At zero temperature all the atoms in the MD simulation are completely frozen. Moreover, similarly to an infinite-temperature model, at long times of the quantum dynamical simulation the exciton is evenly distributed among all molecules, as we will see below. In order to obtain a more realistic description, we modify the stochastic simulation by introducing quantum jumps derived from the zero-point (zp) fluctuations of the modes in the vibrational environment. We refer to this corrected version of the MD propagation as QJC-MD.

However, some of the basic picture is given in Martin et al. (2008). We continue by focusing attention on the chirality of solar features in each stage of the build-up as schematically represented in Figure 5.

Neutrinos are produced and detected as one of the three active neutrino flavors, which propagate as a superposition of all 4 mass eigenstates. A 4-by-4 unitary matrix U transforms between the flavor and mass eigenstate bases. In general, four flavor neutrino oscillations are affected by 6 mixing angles and three CP violating phases. We make some assumptions to reduce the number of free parameters and simplify the analysis. We assume the neutrino masses to be hierarchical, with the heaviest mass eigenstate mostly sterile. We assume the sterile neutrino is a mixture of the 2 heaviest states only. We can then write the mixing matrix as
By comparing the NPV of this second scenario against the first, we can quantify the impact of ignoring costs when they are present.

The presence of a fault appears if making a minor local change, called a remedy, in the polinseq removes the errors that led to its identification without leading to any new errors. Judging the latter is by no means easy. Local changes to a polinseq may involve (i) the insertion of novel instruction to a polinseq, (ii) the removal of existing instructions from the polinseq, and (iii) the modification of existing instructions within the polinseq. Each of these steps are instruction level modifications.
They first look for potential suffixes by searching for frequent word-final substrings. Then, they look for potentially morphologically related pairs, i.e., pairs that end in potential suffixes and share the left substring preceding those suffixes. Finally, they look, among those pairs, for those whose semantic vectors (computed using latent semantic analysis) are significantly correlated. In short, the idea behind the semantic component of their model is that words that tend to co-occur with the same set of words, within a certain window of text, are likely to be semantically correlated words.

This paper uses the entanglement in GHZ state to perform both the teleportation of an arbitrary single quantum state and the remote control of that quantum state simultaneously. The proposed protocol is more efficient than an intuitive solution, that performs quantum teleportation and quantum remote control separately in two distinct entanglements of quantum state. It should be noted that in the proposed protocol, Alice can only perform the rotation operator under Z axis, and Bob can only teleport a single particle. How to design a protocol for Alice to perform an arbitrary operator and Bob to teleport various quantum states is a promising future research.
and hence
The interaction of planetary nebulae (PNs) with the interstellar medium (ISM) was first discussed by Gurzadyan (1969). Smith (1976) used the thin shell model to analyze the evolution of a spherically symmetric expanding PN shell moving through the ISM (see also Isaacman 1979). On the observational side, only a few PNs showed interaction with the ISM (hereafter refereed to as interacting PNs) until the last decade. With better observational imaging instruments (CCD cameras) the field interacting PNs became more popular (e.g., Borkowski, Tsvetanov, & Harrington 1993; Jacoby & Van de Steene 1995; Tweedy, Martos & Noriega-Crespo 1995; Hollis et al. 1996; Zucker & Soker 1997). Borkowski, Sarazin & Soker (1990; hereafter BSS) discuss the potential in using interacting PNs to probe the ISM, and list many interacting and possibly interacting PNs. This list was extended in the review article by Tweedy (1995) and in the atlas of interacting PNs (Tweedy & Kwitter 1996). Tweedy with several collaborators has been leading the observational research in the field (e.g., Tweedy & Kwitter 1994a,b; Tweedy & Napiwotzki 1994). Other studies are in progress, and preliminary results were presented in the conference (e.g. Kerber et al. 2000; Dopita et al. 2000).
The acceleration of coordinate axes that are fixed in the laboratory frame, relative to the observer co-moving with the test particle, is simply the opposite of the test particle acceleration, since the laboratory frame is non-accelerating. Similarly, the relative velocity to the same observer of an object fixed in the laboratory frame is the opposite of the test particle velocity as observed from the laboratory frame. This results in an angular velocity of Thomas precession of the laboratory frame coordinate axes seen by the test particle co-moving observer of

Several remarks are in order: to begin with, at least for the surfaces considered in this paper, the PFA becomes a well defined and controlled approximation scheme: the leading corrections are small when |∂α ψ | ≪1 or, in other words, when the curved surface is almost parallel to the plane. Higher order corrections will be negligible when, in addition to this condition, the scale of variation of the shape of the surface is much larger than the local distance between surfaces. It is also clear that the corrections to PFA only contains local information about the geometry of the surface, and does not include correlations between different points of the surface.

It is worth noting the linear structure of the GMM FV pooling.

Introduction
This work serves as a valuable learning experience and stepping stone to prepare HEP experiments for the next-generation Xeon-Phi-based supercomputers such as Cori. These new machines will be built with the KNL generation of Xeon Phi, though, which has significant design updates with respect to the KNC architecture used for these results. In particular, the difficulties with the tight memory constraints will be relaxed thanks to the increased memory capacity of the KNL cards. Also, the I/O implementation will likely change because the KNL cards are self-hosted and can write directly to hard disks or shared file systems. However, the parallel I/O mechanisms used in these results will still be the preferable way to save event data, so the overall scheme may look similar. New studies will need to be performed when the new Xeon Phi cards become available.
In the models we consider, every object has a type from a finite alphabet and a pose from a finite but large pose space. While classical language models generate sentences using a single derivation, the grammars we consider generate scenes using multiple derivations. These derivations can be unrelated or they can share sub-derivations. This allows for very general descriptions of scenes.
The resulting Frobenius potential is:
In this Letter, we experimentally study trap losses due to nonadiabatic transitions in electrostatically trapped ammonia molecules. We quantify this trap loss mechanism from measurements of the trapping times in an IP-type electrostatic trap with either a zero field or an offset field at the center, under otherwise identical conditions. Moreover, we measured the trapping times for three isotopologues of ammonia, namely 14 NH3, 14 ND3 and 15 ND3. These molecules have subtle differences in their energy level structure, resulting in different probabilities for nonadiabatic transitions. Contrary to the theoretical expectations, the results demonstrate the enormous importance of trap losses due to nonadiabatic transitions even at the present 30 mK temperatures.
Our further calculations, allows us to determine other thermodynamic properties of the PtH at 100 GPa such as the thermodynamic critical field, the specific heat for the superconducting and normal state, the value of the energy gap at the Fermi level, and others.
Abstract
Finally, for the pairwise statistics with lags, the KL-divergence for both the TC-RBM and the Dirichlet-VMM is low, very close to the one for the train data, whereas for the VMM it is considerably higher. This suggests that our proposed methods respect the short order statistics of the musical genre and are better than the VMM in capturing the statistical regularities of the data through time.

We considered a few characteristics, such as age, gender and computer science background, and obtained a few insights into user preferences.

To illustrate how RG methods can be applied to scattering of nonrelativistic particles, let us look at a system of two particles at energies where the range of the forces is not resolved (for example, two nucleons with an energy below about 10 MeV). This can be described by an effective Lagrangian with two-body contact interactions or, equivalently, a Hamiltonian with δ-function potentials. In momentum space, the S-wave potential can be written

Analysis of Majorana Neutrinos
For each setting of the spins of the colliding protons the differential cross-section in θl is controlled by the independent parameters D0, 1, 2, each of which contains information about the parton distributions. To isolate information on the polarised distributions, it is necessary to form asymmetries, either by reversing the spin direction of one of the protons with the other being unpolarised (single-spin asymmetries), or reversing the spin direction of one of the protons, the other being polarised (double-spin asymmetries).
Despite apparent similarities between the AIC and BIC, they answer different questions, as they are derived based on different assumptions. AIC tries to select a model that most adequately describes reality (in the form of the data under examination). This means that in fact the model being a real description of the data is never considered. On the contrary, BIC tries to find the true model among the set of candidates. Because BIC is more stringent, it has a tendency to underfit, while AIC, as a more liberal method, is inclined towards overfitting. This leads sometimes to pointing different models by the two criteria, which happens rarely, but is due to the fact that they try to satisfy different conditions.

Generally, we can expect two competing rates. First is the characteristic root elongation rate, directed downwards and second is the evapotranspiration rate directed upwards. The latter can be divided into the transpiration and evaporation components. It is clear that the root elongation rate would ultimately depend on the evaporation conditions as water serves as a major limiting factor in its growth. At low humidity conditions, we expect the evapotranspiration rate to be faster, thus the development of the evaporation front, zsup also occurs fast. When this happens, the evaporating front, zsup, eventually catches up with the root tip and quickly exposes a large portion of the total root system to a dry zone. The appearance of the dry zone certainly decreases water absorption rates.
We let Dn, r denote the smallest positive integer such that Dn, r Xn, r(x) has rational integer coefficients.
In this paper we report on our measurements of the meridional motions of the magnetic elements. We find variations in the strength and structure of the meridional flow that may help to explain in general how the polar fields are modulated and in particular how they were modulated during cycle 23. These variations may have contributed to the production of the weak axial dipole moment during cycle 23 which, in turn, caused the small amplitude for cycle 24.

In this work we take seriously the last possibility, and investigate the idea of introducing a modified MPP to predict the SM Higgs boson mass from the requirement that our vacuum has only barely survived early cosmology (call it metastability MPP). We shall ask if there should be reasons that MPP ideas might after all lead to metastability MPP. Further we shall ask, phenomenologically, whether such a metastability MPP fits the data.
It appears that most of the remaining disagreements between ΛCDM predictions and observations could be explained by a lack of details in the modeling of complex processes at the smallest scales. These are hard to control in numerical simulations. Hopefully, the increasing computing power will soon allow one to achieve more accurate numerical simulations and test if these discrepancies still remain. It is important to remark that no disagreement is left in the broad, large scale description of the Universe, while the independent observations have flourished in the last few years, giving increased confidence in the validity of the ΛCDM paradigm.

In the few GeV energy regime the excitation and decay of resonances dominate the hadronic cross section. Therefore, all interactions fall in one of 4 categories: elastic scatterings, inelastic scatterings, decays and resonance absorption.

However, this enhancement is at the cost of accuracy of the collected data (as some of the data components will be ignored).

This section will attend the intricate problem of learning the LDAG structure from a set of data. This poses some obvious problems due to the extremely vast model space as well as some additional not so obvious problems due to the flexibility of the models. We introduce a structural learning method that utilizes a non-reversible Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method combined with greedy hill climbing. Such a combination of a stochastic and a deterministic algorithm provides solid performance with a reasonable time complexity. A Bayesian score is used to evaluate the appropriateness of an LDAG given a set of observed data. In order to prevent overfitting, we impose a prior distribution that allows us to balance the ability of an LDAG to match the available learning data with its complexity. We begin with some additional notations.

We followed a similar procedure to study the influence of recency and semantic context. In the case of tag recency, we calculated the days elapsed since the last use of i by u. In the case of the semantic context, we determined the tag co-occurrence value between i and the tags already assigned to the currently tagged resource r (i.e., the second component of the activation equation). Then, as in the case of tag frequency, we pooled together the tags of all users with the same recency or semantic context values and calculated the tag reuse probability for both factors.

A hallmark of scientific reasoning and experimentation has been the exploration of different hypotheses in order to better understand phenomena. With more computational steps and a wider array of rapidly evolving software, the ability to understand and control computational research often relies on understanding different, often-complex interfaces. In some cases, this complexity has led to more rigid workflows where exploration is more limited. Finally, while scripts and other tools can help integrate such workflows, the responsibility for tracking changes and linking results to the steps used is often left to the scientist. Both education and improvements in software can help address these issues, and they often require collaboration between scientists and software architects.

It is possible that given a triple (g, ga, gb), it is hard to compute gab but easy to compute some partial information about gab, such as its least significant bit.

In a distributed setting, any type of non-local resource that can be created by a quantum operation must also be consumed in order to perform the operation. For a bipartite quantum operation, there are three such resources: shared entanglement E and classical communication in the Alice→Bob and Bob→Alice directions, which we shall denote by C→ and C← respectively. We shall use the subscripts R and C to denote, respectively, the minimum of the corresponding resource required to perform a quantum operation and the capacity of the operation corresponding to this resource. The entangling capacity is the maximum amount of entanglement that the operation can create. The classical capacity, in a given direction, is the maximum amount of classical information that the operation can be used to send in that direction.
In this article we treat a yet unsolved problem in theoretical physics: the contruction of a consistent relativistic thermodynamics theory. This particular problem have generated a long controversy in physics and can be approached by a student of a thermodynamics course, using only basic knowledge of thermodynamics and special relativity. Is in this way that including this particular topic as a part of an undergraduated thermodynamics or modern physics course could support the discussion of physics and motivate students to start scientific research at the undergraduate level.

We have presented a new tool, ScannerS, devoted to the search for global minima in multi-Higgs models. In this work we have applied it to some versions of a simple extension of the SM - the addition of a complex singlet to the SM doublet, with some symmetries. The code includes the most relevant theoretical and experimental bounds. Our main focus is in distinguishing the possible phases of each model by using the present experimental data both from the LHC and from dark matter experiments.

Suppose now that the beam is misaligned with the optical axis. Such misalignment can be introduced by slightly tilting one of the interferometer mirrors. The paths resulting from such misalignments are represented as red lines in Fig. 1. Let the transverse coordinates with respect to each aligned, unfolded path, be written as x (within the plane of the interferometer) and y (out of this plane). As can be seen in Fig. 1(c) and its inset, the effect of a Dove prism along the path that includes mirror A is to reflect the mode in x around the optical axis, as well as to reverse the transverse momentum in that direction, kx, while leaving y and ky unchanged. Notice that the longer path length and extra internal reflection introduced by this prism will give an extra phase to the photon. We compensate for this phase by putting other Dove prisms in the other two arms of the interferometer to rebalance the path lengths, but we orient these at right angles to the first, so that they act as parity operators in the y direction (i.e., out of the interferometer plane). This way, the paths resulting from mirror deflections in the interferometer plane will be essentially unchanged by these prisms, whereas out-of-plane deflections would be reflected about the optical axis. As we will now see, the insertion of the prisms changes the stability of the interferometer to mirror tilts.

It is considerably more uncertain if the environments of quasars depend on their optical or radio luminosities, or on redshift. Early studies claimed that radio-loud quasars were located in richer environments than radio-quiet quasars (e.g. Yee & Green 1984, 1987; Ellingson, Green & Yee 1991), but these findings have been contested in a number of recent papers (e.g. Fisher, Bahcall & Kirhakos 1996; McLure & Dunlop 2001; Wold et al 2001). Most studies have not found any relation between the optical luminosity of a quasar and its clustering (Brown, Boyle & Webster 2001; Finn, Impey & Hooper 2001), but there have been a number of papers claiming the existence of a correlation between radio luminosity and environment (e.g. Wold et al 2001; Finn, Impey & Hooper 2001). The studies of Yee & Green (1987) and Ellingson, Yee & Green (1991) found that high-redshift, radio-loud quasars were located in richer environments than low-redshift, radio-loud quasars, but more recent analyses (e.g. Wold et al 2001) fail to find any trend with redshift.

In summary, our results demonstrate that RIXS scattering from metallic Fe1.087Te exhibits theoretically predicted properties which can be understood in terms of the same Fermi threshold physics which influences absorption and photoemission lineshapes. In the fluorescence regime, we have identified an energy scale which appears to reflect material properties related to lattice vibrations. Our observations are significant because they constitute the first quantitative analysis of high-resolution RIXS in a metallic system. Future theoretical and experimental work using high resolution RIXS will help clarify the relative roles of Fermi liquid parameters including electron-hole pair lifetimes, momentum transfer, and exchange phenomena in determining how a photon scatters from a metal near an X-ray absorption edge.

This shows that the failure in reproducing an external classification may indicate a genuinely more complicated organization within the system, in addition to the lack of data or algorithmic mistakes. Besides developing sophisticated algorithms to deal with real systems, we should therefore keep in mind that some observed discrepancies may go beyond the standard classification and carry important information about the system under study. These results warn us against the use of the notion of ground truth. Indeed, it may happen that what we consider as the ground truth is just one of the possible reference points, rather than some absolute truth. Understanding the information employed to define the so-called ground truth is therefore crucial in order to perform a proper comparison between external classification and automatically retrieved communities.

We suggest that part of the reason for this consistent shortcoming of the entire class of QMD-like models may be found in the fact that the model is effectively classical, since the equations of motion for the wavepacket parameters have been derived by a standard variational principle. The resulting description is then the dynamics of the wavepacket centroids and the inherent quantum fluctuations are neglected. The presence of quantum fluctuations is signaled by the fact that the wavepackets are not energy eigenstates. This basic feature generally causes the expectation value of the Hamiltonian to fluctuate in the course of time.
Also, for a partition C and mapping f, we can define the cost of clustering as follows.

Both these statistics are minimized when θ0 is the maximum likelihood estimator of θ given x. Thus for B1 to be satisfied it suffices that the maximum likelihood estimator of θ is well-defined and strictly monotone in x. B2 is satisfied when there exists a θ such that L(θ, x) is an asymmetric function of x. By definition, B3 is satisfied if there exists an x0 such that L(θ, x) is increasing when x < x0 and decreasing when x > x0. This is guaranteed if Pθ has a monotone likelihood ratio.

We were interested in three questions concerning the perturbations marks distributions. The first two questions are related to the tails and the symmetry of the data distribution. The third question is related to a more delicate problem. It is a well known fact that the perturbations locations follow an uniform distribution in K. Nevertheless, much few is known about the spatial distribution of the perturbations marks, except that they are highly dependent on their corresponding locations. So, the third question to be formulated is the following: do the distributions of the perturbations marks exhibit any pattern depending on the perturbation location?

Each of the operon evolution models present a mechanism and fits a biological rationale to the observation that operons/gene blocks exist in extant taxa. However these models do not readily allow us to quantify the changes between either operons/gene block or between different organisms. Moreover, more than one model can generally be applied to a chosen gene block and set of taxa. Therefore, there is a need to create a universally applicable method for charting gene block evolution. Having such a method on hand can help determine the specific evolutionary trajectory of any given gene block.

Similarly, a virtual link is called alternating, if along a branch of the link over-crossing always follow after under-crossing and under-crossing always follow after over-crossing.

Vice versa, if, by switching some overpasses and underpasses, a virtual link diagram can be made alternating, its blunted Gauss diagram is orientable.

Our experimental tests show that for many test proteins, we only need to generate five different contact maps for a single protein in order to yield a contact map with much better accuracy than the first one and those generated by two popular EC analysis methods PSICOV and Evfold. This is especially true when the protein family under prediction has a small number of sequence homologs. This paper focuses on how to generate diverse M-best contact maps, but does not study how to re-rank them. A possible way to do so is that we may conduct protein folding simulation using each predicted contact map and then select the one resulting in the best protein 3D models according to some atom-level energy functions or model quality assessment methods.

We present an alternative approach to this experiment based on the average electric polarizability of a collection of molecules in response to an electromagnetic wave, an intrinsic property of the gas that depends on the electron cloud around the molecules. We show how the polarizability can be found from the intensity versus pressure data in the output of a Michelson interferometer. We updated the usual experiment apparatus by adding two sensors to the Michelson interferometer, an apertured light sensor on the output of the interferometer and a pressure sensor to the vacuum cell, in order to measure the output intensity as a function of pressure. Finally, we show how the refractive index of air can then be calculated from the polarizability for a given pressure and temperature.

Proof Since G has involutive coinverse, every standard solution ju is antiunitary. If all the quantum dimensions of spectral irreducibles u had subexponential growth, the associated Ju would be antiunitary by Theorem 4.8., hence the invariant state would be a trace by Theorem 3.1.
We first studied the photo-induced ring-opening process of the oxirane molecule. Through a ground state scan along the reactive CCO angle of an oxirane molecule followed by TDDFT calculations (vertical excitations), a profile of several low-lying adiabatic excited state curves on which the excited state driven reaction may be carried can be constructed. However, these adiabatic excited state curves ranked by energies do not give us very much knowledge on how the reaction will proceed. We stress that the reaction process can be made much clearer if the excited state potential energy curves are labelled according to their excitation character instead of their energies. We demonstrated that the transition vectors of these low-lying excitations are dominated by the first NTO electron-hole pair (NTO1), and therefore the transition origins of NTO1 can be used to represent the character of these excitations. Based on this approach, we have successfully located several special geometrical points along the scanned CCO coordinate where the transition origins of two adiabatic excited state curves switch. By reconnecting the adiabatic excited state energy points (calculated by TDDFT) based on transition origins instead of energetic ordering, we are then able to depict how the excited state-driven ring-opening process can proceed. This picture is consistent with the previous excited state molecular dynamics study that found that the population of the 1 (n,3pz) state facilitates the ring-opening process, while the population of 1 (n,3s) state does not. We have demonstrated that the 1 (n,3pz) state exhibits a monotonically-decreasing energy curve along the widening CCO angle, leading to a ring-opening reaction. For more complicated reactions with several coordinates involved and geometry strongly distorted, more geometries may be used, e.g. those from an excited state scan and molecular dynamics simulation, to help identify the photo-driven reaction pathways of interest. A promising future direction could be to apply this methodology to larger molecules with much more complex reaction pathways.

We administered the FCI at the beginning and end of every second semester from AY 2011-12 to AY 2014-15. All student answers for each question were recorded and an item analysis was performed with emphasis on the six polarisation-inducing questions. Standard statistical parameters for the four-year data were calculated including p-value for t-test, mean, standard deviation, percent difference, etc. Using these parameters, (a) student performance from pretest to posttest, (b) possible gender difference in overall FCI, (c) existence of polarisation, (d) possible gender difference in the polarization-inducing questions, among others, were analysed.

It is obviously that to find a pair of points with a minimum distance between them is a difficult and massive operation. Therefore, construction of a cluster on just found pair is unprofitable. It is necessary to process a large number of minimal pairs. However, because of this after processing of the next pair and after unification of two clusters, some of the next pairs will already exist in the joint cluster. Thus the number of united clusters will be significantly less than the number of selected pairs. The number of simultaneously processed pairs is set up by user. Of course, it will be easier to finish the clusterisation process in the first pass, but in this case a lot of minimal pairs will be not used because they are in another cluster and computational resource will be wasted.

Partial Wave Analyses of the pp data alone and of the np data alone
Integrating out the mediators at the scale Λ generates what we call SMχ EFT, containing only χ and the whole SM field content as its degrees of freedom. Many explicit realizations for LUV exist in the literature, and they can all be matched onto the SMχ EFT at the cutoff scale Λ. The regime of validity of this EFT extends all the way down to the EWSB scale, where the heavy EW states (W, Z, h and t-quark) have to be integrated out and the residual gauge symmetry is SU(3)c × U(1)em. For this reason we employ a different EFT below the EWSB scale, with only a SU(3)c × U(1)em gauge symmetry and 5 quark flavors, which we call EMSM χ EFT (where EMSM stands for SM with only electromagnetic interactions). In the remaining part of this Section we give a basis of independent operators for both EFTs up to mass dimension 6, as well as a prescription for how to match SM χ EFT onto EMSM χ EFT at the EWSB scale.

SUMMARY
One of the goals that we have in mind in the present paper is to investigate the conditions under which a scenario with positive curvature may mimic an accelerating flat universe at low redshifts. This idea allows us to determinate the exact contribution of the scalar field Q (together with the curvature term) that gives rise to an effective cosmological constant term. In this way we obtain an effective cosmological scenario that coincides with the accepted ΛCDM model.
We also note a false positive (a pedestrian being detected as anomaly) in the last image of column (b). Upon further investigation, this false positive was due to the fact that the cells in the region of the pedestrian had minimal or no activity during the training phase. Consequently any foreground object entering this zone during testing was considered as anomalous, irrespective of the observed features.
Polarimetry to Get Insight into Star Formation Processes

The Fock space we adopt to describe the matter fields provides a simple platform to describe matter coupled to either finite (discrete) or continuous gauge groups, including truncated ones. In particular, we require that the internal degrees of freedom of the fermions provide a sufficient number of states to realize the smallest faithful representation of the considered group already at the single-particle level: the single-particle Hilbert space associated to a matter site must have dimension equal to that of the desired representation of the gauge group, usually the fundamental one.
In order to deal with large values of n, we need the following lemmas.

In this paper we proposed the use of a POMDP for representing the human-robot task communication problem, and we demonstrated the approach through a user experiment. The experiment suggested that this representation results in robots that are robust to teacher error, that can accurately infer task details, and that are perceived to be intelligent. Future work will include more complex tasks and signals, better modeling of the teacher, and improved processing techniques.

We have studied the the critical behaviour of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 polycrystalline sample from dc magnetisation measurement near Tc. We have determined the values of Tc, β, γ, δ. The value of β is very close to 3D Ising value. However, the values of γ and δ do not completely agree with any universality class.
Our purpose of this paper is to elucidate the relation between the set of homoclinic points and the set of recurrence points, and to know the existence of the chain recurrence points. In the both themes, we want to maintain the volume-preserving (or symplectic) dynamics, but to drop the genericity assumption. Since the symplectic diffeomorphisms are automatically volume-preserving, our results in the paper is applicable to the symplectic dynamics as well.
Fortunately, the transitional case occurs only for a very small spatial region, and can usually be safely ignored. In these proceedings we have simply transferred from the adiabatic to the nonadiabatic regimes, skipping the transitional regime altogether.

Figure 3 finally plots the velocity dispersion of the cluster. Again, this value can be compared to the data from young stellar clusters, like in Taurus or Orion. Despite the simplifications in our model, the kinematical properties are in excellent agreement with the observed values.
In this work we apply nuclear EDF to a study of the formation and evolution of cluster states in nuclei. The framework of nuclear EDFs and the role of spatial localization of the individual single-nucleon states is reviewed in section II. Section III presents an analysis of the role of deformation and pronounced level degeneracy on the formation of clusters, and includes a number of examples of cluster structures in excited states. Cluster phenomena and molecular bond in neutron-rich nuclei are discussed in section IV, and section V contains a short summary and conclusion of the present study.
Note that since 1 < a0 there are no singularities in the foregoing expressions. From the conditions a0 > 1 and y < 1 one observes that Py0 and Pφ0 are both positive while σ0 may be positive, negative or zero. Fig. 1 displays σ0 in terms of a0 and y. We observe that for δ > 1 there exists regions that σ0 becomes positive. This is seen clearly in Fig. 1. Also in the interval on which σ0 ≥ 0 the weak and strong energy conditions are satisfied.

ABSTRACT: Since 1988, the United Nations, through the Programme on Space Applications, is supporting the establishment and operation of regional Centres for Space Science and Technology Education in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Western Asia. Simultaneously, education curricula have been developed for remote sensing and geographic information system, satellite communications, satellite meteorology and global climate, and space and atmospheric science. The paper reviews briefly these developments and highlights the most recent updated education curricula in the four disciplines that are made available in 2002, in the six official languages of the United Nations, for implementation at the regional Centres and beyond.
§0. INTRODUCTION
Binning is essential in the case of spectroscopic observations of the stellar kinematics. In fact a minimum S/N is required for a reliable and unbiased extraction of kinematical information from the spectra (e.g., Rix & White 1992; van der Marel & Franx 1993; Kuijken & Merrifield 1993). For this reason binning is invariably used to analyze one-dimensional (1D, e.g., long slit) spectroscopic observations. New developments with Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS; e.g., OASIS on CFHT, SAURON on WHT, VIMOS on VLT, GMOS on Gemini) require methods to perform spatial binning of spectra in two dimensions (2D) too.

In the next phase, we select for every virtual address α ∈ {0, 1} two landmark nodes xα·0 , xα·1 from the connected sub-network Gα . Here α · 0 and α ·1 is the extension of α by symbol 0 or 1, respectively. Landmark node xα·0 is one of the nodes of network Gα that has maximum ω-distance to xα in sub-network Gα , and landmark node xα·1 is one of the nodes of network Gα that has maximum ω-distance to xα·0 in sub-network Gα. A node u of Gα whose ω-distance to xα·0 is less than or equal to the ω-distance between u and xα·1 gets virtual address α·0. It gets virtual address α·1, if the distance between u and xα·0 is greater than the distance between u and xα·1.

where pr and pθ stand for the canonically conjugated momenta of r and φ0 respectively. Besides, we have assumed that the level of reference for the potential energy is z = 0, and the constant value of gravity is denoted by g. As the coordinate θ does not explicitly appear in H, θ is a hidden variable and from the equations of motion we deduce that pθ is a constant of the motion. Physically this is clear because there are only two forces acting on the particle, one being gravity and the other the force of reaction exerted by the surface which is perpendicular to the surface. Thus, both forces are located in the vertical plane formed by the OZ axis and the position vector of the particle, and therefore the momentum of these forces is always horizontal and hence the vertical component of the angular momentum is conserved. In other words pθ is a constant. In consequence, we define the effective radial potential energy U(r) for this problem as

The Introduction
We are interested in whether matchings are stable, and whether there exist stable matchings given a particular matching game G. In general, a matching is stable if no subset of agents has any incentive to reorganize and form new matchings amongst themselves. We distinguish between three standard stability concepts which commonly appear in the matching literature. The first, setwise stability, is the most general and encompasses the other two (corewise stability and pairwise stability). Unless otherwise noted, the stability concept used in this paper is setwise stability, which we interchangeably refer to as set stability.

A further result of A92b is that, in order for shocks to exist, the curvature of the x1 orbits at apocenter must exceed a certain quantity, or in other words, the orbits that are elongated along the bar should be sufficiently peaked or have loops at their apocenters. Furthermore, in order for the shock loci to be offset towards the leading side of the bar, the x2 orbits must not only exist, but also have a sufficient extent.

Conclusions
Anecdotal evidence and visual examination of some galaxies suggest that chaotic gas inflows often result in mis-alignments of newly formed stellar disks with previous stellar disk/non-spherical bulges, and the orbital planes of infalling satellite stellar or gas clumps do not always have a fixed orientation. These processes cumulatively may be thought to create stellar distributions in the central regions that are dynamically hot, which, in turn, provides conditions that are unfavorable to secular formation of stellar bars. We check if this indeed is the case.
However, there do exist equations which are integrable but do not admit a first order formal recursion operator. One such equation is

The three ready brain components are zero at tob, and thereafter receive current from the corresponding component in the first row of eq. 2. That current is due to the physiological interaction that occurs when the observer interacts (e.g., visually) with the apparatus.
From the flavor pre-analysis to dark matter scenarios
Comparative data, while an integral and powerful tool in evolutionary biology, sometimes holds only limited information about the evolutionary process. We suggest that the application of these approaches to specific dataset should routinely be guided by the use of simulation to assess model choice and power.
In Appendix C, we present lists of the hidden sector embeddings which complete the CMM analysis. We have not displayed Case 5 GH models, since we do not regard them as affording viable scenarios of hidden sector dynamical supersymmetry breaking. They are, however, available from the author upon request. Eliminating the Case 5 GH models from the total of 192, we are left with 175 models. Also not included is the enumeration of the spectrum of massless matter for these models, with their U(1) charges. We have performed this analysis and hope to present interesting examples and a summary of general features in a later publication.

To observe ray-like refraction of flux dendrites one needs superconducting films where the propagation velocities in the different parts of the device is not too different. For a partly metal-coated film the braking parameter S should be not too large, otherwise the damping will dominate. We leave it for future work to identify more precisely the boundaries in parameter space of the interesting low-damping regime reported in this paper.

Our proposal is different. We talk about small fluctuations of geometry irrespective to the foundational issues of quantum mechanics. Note also that what we mean is not just gravitons radiated from the Black Hole which are of little or no interest for resolving the paradox, but it is really an effect of a slightly random medium with the spacetime foam on the way of the photons. Of course, it would be completely legitimate to wonder how the distant fluctuations and the nearby emission effects contrive to avoid the potential tensions and save the day.

In this section we consider the dispersion phenomenon in a 2-dim porous medium domain, which is obtained by intersecting a 3-dim uniaxial porous medium with a plane that is parallel to the uniaxial axis. In the resulting 2-dim porous medium domain, there are two mirror lines, which are perpendicular to each other. By these symmetry elements, it is easy to recognize the dihedral point symmetry group D2, which is one of ten 2-dim point symmetry subgroups of O(2).
From there, the problem becomes the classical Lyapounov-Levy-Feller Theorem. And we have the following conclusion:

One distinguishes different β-decay transitions also by their forbiddenness, or the degree of suppression of the quantum mechanical amplitude that describes the process. This suppression is determined by factors of three small quantities: R/λ, vN and αZ, which are the ratio of the nuclear radius and the de Broglie wavelength of the leptons, the velocity of the decaying nucleon in units of c, and the fine-structure constant times the charge of the daughter nucleus, respectively. Factors of R/λ come from the leptons carrying away orbital angular momentum (corresponding to higher order terms in the multipole expansion of the lepton wavefunctions). The quantities vN and αZ originate from relativistic and Coulomb effects, respectively.
Following the program outlined above and using the notions and results of Sect. 1, we will extend the GHSZ and Mermin argument to show:
In the event loop e.g. a user analysis module may query for a transient conditions data object with a time stamp as a key. Such a query happens when the user module tries to access a transient conditions data object in the environment. The key is tested by the corresponding RooCondProxy against the validity interval of possibly existing transient objects. When a valid transient object exists it is returned, otherwise the proxy uses its RooCondReader to obtain the corresponding persistent object from the ROOT conditions database. The RooCondReader creates a new transient object which is returned by the proxy to the user.

Two vertices a and b are adjacent in H if and only if their letters alternate in the word. So, they must be in the same order in each permutation, i.e. either a < b in every linear order or b < a in every linear order. But this means that a and b are comparable in the poset induced by the intersection of the linear orders, i.e. a and b are adjacent in its comparability graph.

Gauss diagrams considered above are signed arrow diagrams.
We observed V2275 Cyg beginning on HJD 2452930.61 (2003 Oct 18) with the 1.8-m Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT). This was 790 days after maximum light. Observations continued the next night starting at HJD 2452931.59. The CCD was binned 2×2 providing a scale of 0.4 arcsec/pixel. V-band exposures were 120 seconds with 30 second readout time covering about 10 hours over the two nights. The resulting images were bias subtracted and flat-fielded and instrumental magnitudes were measured using aperture photometry. Three comparison stars near the nova (Figure 1) were also measured and their positions listed in Table 1. Approximate V-band magnitudes for the stars were estimated from zero-point and airmass coefficients measured at the VATT on earlier runs with standard magnitude errors estimated to be ±0.05 mag.

Low in the corona, the magnetic field is sufficiently dominant over the plasma forces that a force-free field approximation is generally applicable. Moreover, for large-scale coronal structure the effects of force-free electric currents, which are inversely proportional to length scale, may be neglected. A potential-field model for the corona must satisfy,

In this variational principle, the specific variables to hold fixed depend on the first law. The appropriate area to hold fixed is that of the apparent horizon, which is determined by the spatial geometry alone (unlike the event horizon, which is a global spacetime property). The apparent horizon generally lies inside the event horizon, and coincides with it for a static or stationary spacetime.

This result is useful in the approximate computation of multiple integrals over S. Together with further results of this paper it allows us to give error bounds of the cubatures of the form of a conical combination of the values of an integrand at some points of S. These error bounds depend on the second order differential of the function involved.
Tunka-Rex is a digital radio array for the detection of air showers in Siberia. Besides determining the precision and overall benefit of a radio detector in combination with an air-Cherenkov detector, its goal is to determine the absolute scale of radio emission. Therefore, we performed an absolute calibration with a commercially available reference source, reaching an accuracy for an individual amplitude measurement of 22%, including 18% uncertainty on the absolute scale. The same reference source was also used by LOPES and LOFAR. These three experiments now have a consistent amplitude calibration. Comparing the measured amplitudes to the predictions of the simulation code CoREAS, we find agreement within the uncertainties. Therefore, Tunka-Rex confirms the applicability of CoREAS for the simulation of absolute amplitudes of radio emission by air showers. It also provides a measure of the absolute scale of radio amplitudes in its frequency band.
We observed Fairall 9 with the Suzaku X-ray Telescope. The 168 ksec run started on 2007 June 7 at 3:34:52 (TT). The data were taken using the XIS and HXD detectors, using the XIS pointing position. The three XIS CCD cameras (XIS0, XIS1, and XIS3) cover 0.2-12.0 keV while the HXD/PIN covers the 10.0-60.0 keV band. The XIS data were taken in both 3x3 and 5x5 binning models.

As all faces have positive circulation in clockwise direction, the total sum remains nonzero. Now, observe that if the cycle C goes through the subtree Ti, then its projection in r(T), say Ci, must contain at least one of the faces adjacent to the pair/triplet in r(T), at which Ti is connected. Since, circulation of this face is 2UTi, contribution from this component will surpass the total sum of all the subtrees where C passes through.
We express our gratitude to the invited speakers Jetty Kleijn and Cosimo Laneve for their very interesting talks. The first talk presents similarities and differences between Petri nets and membrane systems, and how to enhance the Petri nets in order to faithfully model the dynamics of the biological phenomena represented by membrane systems and reaction systems. The second talk deals with reversibility in massive concurrent systems; reversible structures for massive concurrent systems are introduced and studied, and an equivalence on computations that abstracts away from the order of causally independent reductions is defined.

Conclusion
Astronomers in both camps can take heart in the fact that there are many more bright lenses waiting to be discovered. By way of illustration, there are some 5500 quasars brighter than B = 18.5 in the 7500 square degrees of the Hamburg-ESO survey (Wisotzki et al. 2000). Imaging these at high resolution should yield (in addition to the six already found) roughly 18 as yet undiscovered lenses for a conservative, Einstein-de Sitter model. Whether by brute force or elegance, gravitational lenses will give a competitive value for H0.

Another consequence is that coverings of our class of homogeneous metric space quotients, in particular of Riemannian nilmanifolds, always are normal coverings.
It is straightforward to solve the equations in the appendix for the three cases described above. We collect these results here and look at a special case in slightly more detail. The appendix contains three equations which assume that R1 , R2 , R3 are non-zero. We will solve for three quantities in terms of the remaining undetermined quantities.

The result of the relative infinitesimal motions given by (Mi, ωi), i = 1, ..., n on the corresponding couples (Bi + 1/Bi) is clearly the identity when considered relative to one and the same body, say (B1/B1). Thus, generalizing the null torsor condition in dimension three, we must have:

In summary, while the arguments are admittedly vague and they do involve a certain level of guess, trial and error, the presented parametrization offers a good chance that with further restrictions on the parameters a two-spin interaction Hamiltonian can be obtained. As will be seen shortly, five conditions are imposed so that the resulting Hamiltonian depends on three (real) parameters.

Hence, suppose that nk is small enough to ensure that both γk(τ), γk(τ) + nk ∈ γk(F). In this case, according with the previous lemma, the reduction algorithm will return the same matrix (up to a sign).
In a multi-layer extended system, MEC1 identifies the two loads and forwards the request on the first load, temporarily buffers the data, and returns it on the second load. The MECs on the other layers are much simpler, either executing the received commands or forwarding them to the next layer.

Instead of just comparing the robustness, after the removal of all of the edges, we would like to study the behavior of the attacks after only a few strikes. To do so, we define a variant of the R-index which takes into account only the first n strikes of an attack. Thus, for a simultaneous attack (where the nodes are ranked by a metric only once at the beginning), the Rn-index is defined as:
In conclusion, we have proved that the condition of positivity in addition to the linearity and the hermitian-preservation completely excludes all the possible maps to uncorrelatedly clone a phase-set of states for all φ probabilistically. Since quantum operations satisfy the linearity, the hermitian-preservation, and the positivity at least, our result means that it is impossible to uncorrelatedly clone a phase-set of input states for all φ probabilistically in quantum mechanics.

Note that tβ is time-dependent; as a function of time, tβ increases as the charging energy for the octagonal island β is slowly turned on during the stabilizer measurement and decreases as the charging energy is slowly turned off after the measurement has been completed.
In the coming years, new breakthroughs should be coming in studies of relativistic jets and blazars, enriched by Fermi/LAT results and by an effective use of the VLBI potential for studies of blazars. There are several potential focal points for these studies.
The study of zeros of partition functions, initiated by Yang and Lee, provides an important qualitative and quantitative tool in the study of critical phenomena. This has frequently been used for periodic as well as hierarchical lattices. Here, we consider magnetic field and temperature zeros of Ising model partition functions on several aperiodic structures. In 1D, we analyze aperiodic chains obtained from substitution rules, the most prominent example being the Fibonacci chain. In 2D, we focus on the tenfold symmetric triangular tiling which allows efficient numerical treatment by means of corner transfer matrices.

In order for a solver to take account of stability, it would need to model both the cost of enacting a candidate configuration, and the benefit gained by doing so. To take account of robustness, the solver would need to be able to predict the likelihood of future events, and be able to model the impact of the reconfigurations required by those events.
At first, the Watcher merely displayed alarms and informed people of problems. This service was very valuable, but we soon realized we needed more. For example, if the telescope stopped moving during a slew or track, the watcher would clearly indicate that the telescope had stopped moving, but not always why it had stopped. Because the SDSS telescope is highly-interlocked to protect it, its instruments, and its users, there were many root causes that might cause the telescope to stop moving. Since the Watcher already had access to all the low-level interlock signals, we added the interlock logic within it, thereby making it possible for the Watcher to indicate the root cause of all interlock-driven problems as well as the problems themselves. Thus, the Watcher became not only a problem notification tool, but also a problem diagnosis tool. It is unclear which mode was most valuable. Both were needed and relied upon extensively.

So now all we need to do is show that starting with a graph which is not a tree, with elliptic leaves and otherwise rational vertices, there is a graph of the same genus, satisfying the properties of the previous lemma, with at least as many automorphisms.

We have shown that by using an Autoencoder to initialise the temporal weights of a TRBM, forming what we call a TARBM, a significant performance increase can be achieved in modelling and generating from a sequential motion capture dataset. We also show that the TARBM is able to learn high level structure from natural movies and account for the transformation of these features over time. Additionally, the evolution of the learned temporal filters are easily interpretable and help to better understand how the model represents the trained data.
Quantum information?
Flat-Field coefficients are used to determine the inhomogeneity between the different pixels. It can be due to different quantum efficiencies of the PMTs and different reflectivities of the Winston cones. These flat-field coefficients are measured during specific flat-field runs, during which cameras are uniformly illuminated with LED flashers mounted on the telescope dish. Flat-field runs are performed as often as possible when the weather does not allow observation runs.

Python, however, is a general purpose programming language, while R is generally limited to tasks within the realm of statistical computing. With Python, students learn and build confidence using general programming concepts that are common amongst other popular programming languages such as Java, C, or C++. The course also differs from typical introductory computer science courses that emphasize program design, as we integrate general programming concepts with an emphasis on data preparation, processing, and presentation. Moreover, data-intensive computer science courses, such as a machine learning course, often have one or more programming classes as a prerequisite, which becomes a barrier to enrollment for students in some fields, such as the social sciences. Our course has no prerequisites, and students are not expected to have any programming experience.

All results are then scaled to the opening angle of Θ2 < 0.015 deg2.).

The simplest hypothesis is that there is a coeval burst of star formation in a cluster after which the stars themselves blow winds to make the bubble and eventually die as supernovae. This hypothesis is especially interesting because it implies that if the γ-ray bursts that go off in the low density environments are, in fact, within such self-generated bubbles (cf. points 1 and 2 of §3), then the stars that produce the γ-ray bursts are not the most massive stars. Some stars must already have evolved with strong winds and perhaps died to blow a sufficiently low density bubble. This raises the possibility of placing an upper limit on the progenitor mass of γ-ray burst progenitor stars.

The acoustical receiver gathers input from the covert network and forwards it to a named pipe. From there, a local mail server (i.e., sendmail, but a remote mail server could also be used) is called upon to send an SMTP message out to an arbitrary email address. This message could just contain the recorded keystrokes, but it is also possible to include the GUWMANET/GUWAL headers in order to tunnel the protocol over HTTP/TCP/IP (circumventing corporate firewalls), and to extend the covert acoustical mesh network to another covert network at any place in the world. The attacker has to be (directly or indirectly) connected to the Internet in order to perform this procedure, but messages could also be gathered and sent out as soon as Internet access is established. Sending out gathered keystrokes to a local SMTP server and forwarding them to a remote email server has been successfully performed in the previously defined experimental setup.

Another interesting Higgs boson decay channel to explore is an invisible decay, which is vanishingly small in the SM. The interest to this channel is driven by the fact that in many SM extensions the Higgs boson serves as a portal to dark matter (DM) sector, i.e., it is expected to couple to DM particles (χ) and if they are light enough, it could decay invisibly via H → χχ.

The coexistence of TSSs and 2DEG states is a very exotic example in a viewpoint of surface physics and have potential applications in the field of nanoscale spintronic devices, so the understanding of their origin and properties is essential in this TI physics. However, the newly developed 2DEG has a complex spin-orbit-split electronic structure, which could be an obstacle depending on the way how to implement TI-based devices. For example, when we want to use an electric current through only the TSSs in Bi2Se3 or when we want to make an n-type TI-metal junction whose current channel is only TSSs, those 2DEG states are definitely to be removed. In spite of these practical needs, all reports on the effects of adsorbates or surface impurities on Bi2Se3 surfaces have only shown that the 2DEG states are easily formed by various kinds of adsorbates in an ultra-high vacuum, but have not suggested a possible way to remove the developed 2DEG states without killing the TSSs.

We have demonstrated a novel stereovision algorithm for high-frame rate detections of obstacles. Our system is capable of quickly and accurately detecting obstacles at a single disparity and using a state-estimator to update the position of obstacles seen in the past, building a full, local, 3D map. It is capable of running at 120 fps on a standard mobile-CPU and is lightweight and robust enough for flight experiments on small UAVs. This system will allow a new class of autonomous UAVs to fly in clutter with all perception and computation onboard.

The slab fermion Casimir effect for a piston shall be also studied. It is always assumed that fermions appearing in different chambers must have different flavors, for consistent slab boundary conditions. The fermion piston has nothing new to offer as far as regularization method is concerned but we shall compute the Casimir force in order to check the validity of the rules that hold in the boson piston case. It would be interesting to see that the fermionic Casimir force between plates is attractive, contrary to what one expects.

In this paper, we have presented a solution for finding subgraphs that are statistically significantly enriched in one class of graphs but not another. The difficulty of the problem stems from the two facts that (1) one has to consider an enormous search space of candidate subgraphs and that (2) one has to correct the significance level for multiple testing to control the FWER, as one tests a large number of candidate subgraphs simultaneously. The first problem leads to enormous computational runtime problems, the second one to a loss in the statistical power to detect significant subgraphs.

Nearly half the sky is now publically available. At the time of this writing (11 October 2000), 99.8% of the sky has been observed with catalog-quality data.

Determining the total number of representative IDs for a given M and N is a computationally difficult problem. Our exhaustive search method is guaranteed to find all possible types of IDs, but it also finds many permutations of the same representative ID. In general, to compare two canonical IDM Ns and determine if they are truly distinct, one must take all N !M! permutations of the order of the qubits and observables in one ID and compare these to the other ID, though in some cases there are significant shortcuts for this computation. To give a sense for the scope of this problem, the exhaustive search returns 163,910 different critical ID66s, every pair of which must be checked to determine if they belong to the same representative ID, and each of those checks requires as many as (6!)2 permutations. Perhaps thankfully, we cannot even complete our exhaustive searches for any IDs larger than M = 6 and N = 7, and indeed we find a staggering 2,466,888 different critical ID67s to sort through. So the question of how many representative critical IDs exist for larger values of M and N remains open.
Other observations carried out in the 1980s, as the emission in X-rays produced by the hot gas in clusters of galaxies or the image distortions and magnifications produced by galaxy clusters acting as gravitational lenses, have corroborated the need for dark matter.

The weakness with this model is that often our posterior has a lot of local maxima and the EM algorithm is sensitive to the initialization point because it will converge to the closest maximum. Thus, it requires many random restarts or a good starting point to converge to a good local maximum. Additionally, if the starting point is not very good, the EM algorithm can take a long time to converge.

Most X-ray transients, whether Be/X-ray binaries or low mass X-ray binaries (having either neutron star or black hole companions), display outbursts typically lasting from a few weeks to months. Such durations are compatible with viscous timescales in a typical accretion disc. Fast outbursts, with much shorter durations, must be due to a completely different physical mechanism. Here we have shown that at least a fraction of the recurrent fast X-ray transients are associated with luminous OB stars, suggesting that the mass transfer mechanism feeding the accreting compact object is a radiative wind, and therefore have identified the class of SFXTs.
Introduction
Regardless of the dimension of the latent space, the iWMM will tend to model each cluster with as low-dimensional a Gaussian as possible. This is because, if the data in a cluster can be made to lie in a low-dimensional plane, a narrowly-shaped Gaussian will assign the latent coordinates much higher likelihood than a spherical Gaussian.

In our experiment, the magnetic trapping potential is a 3D potential which confines the atoms to an overall cigar-shaped distribution, while in the 1D optical lattice the atoms are confined to 2D planes. Therefore, by increasing the strength of the optical lattice superposed to a 3D potential it is possible to follow the transition from a 3D BEC to an array of 2D degenerate atomic clouds confined radially by the magnetic potential and assorted in the axial direction like disks in a shelf.

The detection of light scattered off the surface of a circumstellar disk is substantially more difficult if the star itself is unobscured by surrounding dust. High-contrast imaging techniques are essential for success and have resulted in a handful of resolved disks around T Tauri or Herbig Ae stars, including GG Tau (Roddier et al. 1996), GM Aur (Stapelfeldt et al. 1995; Koerner et al. 1998), UY Aur (Close et al. 1998), and HD 163296 (Grady et al. 1999). Recently, HST WFPC2 (Krist et al. 2000) and NICMOS (Weinberger et al. 1999) observations of a disk around the nearby TTs, TW Hydrae, were confirmed by Trilling et al. (2001) with ground-based coronagraphic images. The disk is oriented with its rotational axis parallel to the line of sight. Displayed in Fig. 1, ground-based near-infrared coronagraphic images of TW Hya show a face-on disk, in good agreement with HST/WFPC2 (Krist et al. 1999) and HST/NICMOS coronagraphic images of the scattered light (Weinberg et al. 1999). To first order, all three observations produce similar radial intensity profiles that fall off approximately as the third power of the radial distance from the star.

Once the SQ1 is turned on, the flux from the applied field couples into the SQ1. The error signal is sampled again, and feedback is applied to the SQ1 to null the applied flux. This is the SQ1 contribution to the effective area. We thus separate out the SQ1 and SQ2 effective areas.

Feature contributions from a single feature can contain variance from main effects and/or interaction effects. A measure of goodness-of-visualization has been introduced to evaluate if the feature contributions of a given feature alone can be explained in the context of itself. If not, color gradients traversing the mapping space can be used to pin-point overlooked interactions within feature contributions and features. Sizable interactions can be visualized in two-way interaction plots in the context of two features and perhaps even a third feature as color gradient. Again a goodness-of-visualization can be computed and evaluated for such a visualization.
Protein forces may exceed critical forces for DNA structural transitions
We also designed a minimum detectable source simulation tool. The user chooses a radioactive source, a minimum desired statistical power, a background observation period, and a new observation day. The simulation grids the data in the new observation day and sequentially injects a source at each grid location, recording the minimum source size required to have the desired power of detection in at least one grid cell. (Again, power is calculated by testing if the cell would be considered significant after false discovery rate control.) This produces a map of source sizes: the smallest detectable source size at each location.

Both analog and digital information are important in physics. All information that can be copied is digital, but this information does not capture all of the information in a system and the rest is characterised by analog information, which acts as decision theoretic probability. Together they help to explain the second law of thermodynamics. The digital information that can be copied contains knowledge that explains the arrow of time. The analog information that cannot be copied contributes to making knowledge imperfect, and this contributes to the growth of entropy.

Most of the luminosity of very young stellar objects and protostars is emitted in the far-infrared, wavelengths that are essentially invisible to ground-based telescopes due to absorption by water vapor. Until the recent commissioning of the Herschel Space Observatory (Pilbratt et al. 2010) and the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA; Gehrz et al. 2011), the far-infrared, however, has suffered from a substantial deficit in angular resolution compared to neighboring wavelengths observable with large ground-based telescopes. High mass young stars typically form in dense clusters, and this puts a special premium on the value of high angular resolution to resolve individual components to understand their evolutionary state.
We need the following classical lemma.

With the development of computer and Internet technologies, networks are everywhere in our common life. Graph models are useful in describing and analyzing many different kinds of relationships and interdependencies. In order to have a better understanding of organizations and functions in real-world networked systems, community structure of graphs is a primary feature that should be taken into consideration. Communities, also called clusters or modules, are groups of nodes (vertices) which probably share common properties and/or play similar roles within the graph. They can extract specific structures from complex networks, and consequently community detection has attracted considerable attention crossing many areas from physics, biology, and economics to sociology, where systems are often represented as graphs.

It deserves to be mentioned at this point that, whereas the results in this paper on the existence of compatible representations of centralizer algebras of a normed algebra can, by passing to its completion, easily be derived from their versions for the centralizer algebras of a Banach algebra, this is no longer the case for our results on embeddings of centralizer algebras. The reason is simply that the centralizer algebras of a normed algebra may be strictly smaller than those of its Banach algebra completion. Thus our consideration of normed algebras rather than Banach algebras does not only make manifest that the factorization theorem is not needed, but it also avoids being unnecessarily restrictive as to the scope of the results.

One could also imagine that because the true path realized would be guided towards a sort of maximum in the probability density the derivatives of log P(path) near that path will be small and that such an effect of derivatives at maximum being zero could lead to a reduction to zero of the coefficients determining say how unlikely a path becomes by having a Higgs particle produced.

The sea effect arises, because the magnetic field in the quark determinant changes the relative weight of the gauge configurations, and is therefore equivalent to a reweighting in B. In general, reweighting is a technique that uses configurations generated at a given (starting) point of the parameter space, and assigns a new weight to each configuration, in a fashion that the resulting ensemble describes the system at a new (target) point of the parameter space. Thus, the expectation value of an arbitrary observable O at the target point is obtained in terms of measurements on the configurations generated at the starting point. Here, we will consider the B = 0 system as the starting point, and the B > 0 system as the target ensemble. For this case, the difference of weights equals the ratio of quark determinants at B and at B = 0, and the exact rewriting of the expectation value at B reads
Using this expression it is possible to obtain that:

The slope of the HI mass function (HIMF) at the low mass end is a much debated topic. It is related to the distribution of primordial density fluctuations and it helps constraining galaxy formation scenarios. In case a large undiscovered population of HI rich dwarf galaxies does exist, it may contain a non-negligible fraction of the baryon content of the universe and provide fuel for the star formation process in more massive disk galaxies through their capture, infall and accretion. Furthermore, the slope of the HIMF ties indirectly with the recently launched hypothesis that the population of High Velocity Clouds (HVCs) as cataloged by Wakker & Van Woerden (1991), apparently associated with the Milky Way, might actually be of an extragalactic nature, being the primordial remnants of the formation of the Local Group (Blitz et al. 1999).

To study the association of solar flares to the SEP events one has to follow all the data related to soft X-ray emission and Hα line absorption. The GOES series of satellites provide observations through the Solar Geophysical Data. On the other hand, the YOHKOH satellite provides continuous observation for the Sun in soft X-ray emission. Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) have been shown to be associated with Long Duration Events (LDEs) (Sheeley et al., 1975; Kahler, 1977; and Sheeley et al., 1983), and with interplanetary shocks (Sheeley et al., 1983, 1985).
Introduction:
We consider how Lorentz-violating interactions in the Faddeev-Popov ghost sector will affect scalar QED. The behavior depends sensitively on whether the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken. If the symmetry is not broken, Lorentz violations in the ghost sector are unphysical, but if there is spontaneous breaking, radiative corrections will induce Lorentz-violating and gauge-dependent terms in other sectors of the theory.
The entropy of the monoatomic ideal gas as a function of the pressure p instead of the volume V is obtained with the ideal-gas equation by the substitution V = NkT/p.

In Fig. 6, we display the results of Ws at Vs. L in (2+1) dimensions. The filled squares are the values calculated from the simulation results. The corresponding fit gives α = 0.357 ± 0.005. Fig. 7 shows the log-log plot of G(x, t) Vs. x. From its slope, α = 0.355 ± 0.001. The line is fitted between x = 2 to 50. Thus both the methods give results matching within statistical margin.

Results indicate that the total stellar mass in sink particles may be reduced by up to 23% due to the action of PI photons emitted form the most massive stars. The final instantaneous SFR is reduced to 62% of its original value. The overall distribution of sink particle masses does not seem to be greatly affected with the most noticeable changes occurring at the high mass end. The maximum sink mass attained is reduced and fewer massive stellar clusters form. As we cannot include the possible dynamical feedback effects of the hot ionised gas to trigger additional star formation our results provide an estimate of the maximum impact of PI feedback.

The problems presented by the new heterogeneous architectures and the resulting requirements on software are not unique to HEP. While we will almost certainly have to rethink adapt our own algorithms, data structures and software designs at some level, and the nature of advanced research also tends to put us at the bleeding edge of new technologies, it is unlikely that HEP alone will provide complete solutions to these problems. We will certainly profit from collaborating with others and in this section we emphasize several types of collaborations which we expect will be important.
We begin our consideration from reproduction of some well-known facts about embedding of manifolds into Euclidean space.
We consider mass terms only after all right-handed fermions and heavy leptons are integrated out, in which case only the left-handed leptons L = (e, ν) and the Higgs are left. With two exceptions to be discussed below, the left-handed fermions are assigned to a three-dimensional irreducible representation (3D IR) of G. For dynamical models with the presence of right-handed and/or heavy leptons, the present formalism gives only the constraint placed on the effective model after these other leptons are integrated out.

As a rule, we find that the performance of the simulation algorithm does not significantly depend on the value of csw. The only exception are the autocorrelation times τ for which there are indications that they are particularly large when both csw and β are small.
In the kinematics of sufficiently small x in DIS, where the QCD evolution equation should be violated, a contribution of multi-Pomeron exchanges may appear significant if the rapid increase of the parton distribution with decreasing x would not be stopped through the diffusion of small configurations to the soft scale.

We are calculating the local galaxy density of each galaxy in terms of the number density of neighbouring galaxies. This is done by smoothing every galaxy with a Gaussian filter (Giuricin et al. 1993; Monaco et al. 1994) and by correcting the incompletion of the sample at large distances through the selection function of the sample. The main goal of this line of research is to use small-scale density parameters to analyze environmental effects on the properties of nearby galaxies.

Just to see some qualitative features of a possible solution at high rapidities and atomic numbers we applied a simple variational procedure, approximating the fields by certain simple trial functions with a single parameter to be determined from the stationary point equation. It is hopeless to expect to study the gluon distribution from such a simple approach. One expects more reasonable answers for the eikonal and especially for the total cross-sections which are weakly dependent on moderate variations of the fields. Our results seem to indicate that with the further rise of energy the cross-sections continue to grow slowly, much slowlier than with a single BFKL exchange. The eikonal function in the center continues to fall, very slowly in variant II for the initial function and rather fast for variant I.

High metallicity is common among quasars. As an independent parameter describing quasars, metallicity may be used to trace the evolutionary history of quasars. The metallicity in quasars may open a new way to understand the growth of a SMBH. It has been suggested by Hamann & Ferland (1993) that NV/CIV or NV/HeII are very good indicators of the metallicity in quasars. They subsequently measured the metallicity in a large sample of quasars (Hamann & Ferland 1993, 1999). There appears unambiguous evidence for a correlation between metallicity and luminosity. Although we do not fit this correlation via regression, it is found that
Then the data series is transformed to the Sanson-Flamsteed coordinate system to remove the geometrical distortions caused by the projection of the sphere to the disc.

The K2 mission plan is to point near the ecliptic, sequentially observing fields as it orbits the Sun. This observing strategy regularly brings new, well-characterized target regions into view, enabling observations of scientifically important objects across a wide range of galactic latitudes in both the northern and southern skies. K2 will perform a series of long, ecliptic-pointed campaigns that use the proven Kepler infrastructure to conduct new research into planet formation processes, young stars, stellar activity, stellar structure and evolution, and extragalactic science. Herein, we present the details of our new method of spacecraft operation and some early results that characterize the scientific abilities of K2.

The connection of vacuum energy and matter creation has already been discussed in papers by Hoyle & Narlikar (1966a, 1966b) and later by Hoyle (1990, 1992) and Hoyle, Burbidge & Narlikar (1993). The requirement that general relativistic field equations should be conformally invariant with respect to any scale recalibrations leads these authors to the introduction of a general relativistic action potential which describes mass generation at geodetic motions of particles. Connected with this mass generation a so-called C-field (creation-field) can be introduced which turns out to be connected with geodetic mass motions themselves. It can then be shown (Hoyle et al. 1993) that this C-field when introduced into the general relativistic field equations leads to terms equivalent to those resulting from vacuum energy. A similar connection between vacuum energy density and mass density was also found by Massa (1994) who shows that Lambda should be proportional to mass density. Concluding these considerations one might say that up to now there is a lack of a rigorous formulation for the transition of vacuum fluctuations into real masses, nevertheless there is at least the idea first discussed by Hawking (1975) that treating the quantum mechanics of particles and antiparticles in the neighborhood of black holes reveals the appearance of real particles, i.e. the decay of a pure vacuum into a mass-loaded vacuum around these black holes. The so-called Hawking radiation in this respect is nothing else but a materialisation of vacuum energy in strong gravitational fields. Perhaps in this respect the expanding universe also represents a form of a time-dependent gravitational field which induces matter creation through the embedded quantum mechanical wavefunctions of particles.
The DMRG technique as a numerical real-space method, is in fact always applied to finite systems. However, in dependence on the size of the system, it can yield approximate descriptions of 1D or 2D infinite systems.

We develop statistical mechanics for a nonrelativisitic ideal gas in the presence of Lorentz violating background fields. The analysis is performed using the Standard-Model Extension (SME). We derive the corresponding laws of thermodynamics and find that, to lowest order in Lorentz violation, the scalar thermodynamic variables are corrected by a rotationally invariant combination of the Lorentz terms which can be interpreted in terms of a (frame dependent) effective mass. We find that spin couplings can induce a temperature independent polarization in the gas that is not present in the conventional case.

The systematic error of the order of 0.005 in all of these is mainly due to uncertainties in modeling the HII regions, for example, the amount of neutral helium and the collisional excitation of HI, which tend to cause underestimates of Y, and temperature fluctuations, which tend to cause overestimates. The range of estimates reflects these uncertainties. It will be hard to reduce these errors significantly, but they are well controlled at the 0.005 level. (In particular the uncertainty due to calculated emissivities of helium lines have largely disappeared.)

Since the integral curve starts and ends at the axis, then the resulting 2-surface is compact. Since wa, and the axial Killing field are spacelike everywhere, then so is the resulting 2-surface. The 2-surface is smooth since wa is smooth everywhere and at the north pole, θ = 0, and at the south pole, θ = π, the surface was shown to be smooth. Finally, the expansion of outgoing null geodesics orthogonal to it is negative everywhere, as was shown throughout the construction. It is, therefore, an outer trapped surface and it contains the initial point. This completes the proof.

Place masses at the vertices of the quadrilateral such that the center of mass of each edge falls onto a point of tangency. One way to do this is to place, at each vertex, a mass equal to 1 over the distance from that the vertex to each point of tangency of the edges that vertex is on (the two distances must be equal). Then the center of mass of the whole arrangement will have to be on each line connecting pairs of opposite points of tangency. Therefore, these lines intersect, and all four points of tangency are in one plane, as desired.

The most recent gamma ray results come from the FERMI-LAT observatory (Mizuno et al., 2011). These workers have examined the local region of the Outer Galaxy: specifically the Local Arm and the Perseus Arm regions as well as the IA region between the two. For gamma ray energies of greater than 0.3 GeV they found similar intensities from the Perseus arm and the IA region, implying a deficit of around zero. They found 15% less emission from the IA region than that in the Local Arm, implying a deficit of 15%. Hence, these values indicate deficits due to IA, SA differences of less than or order 15%.

The results illustrate what occurs inside the memory as pulses are sent in. As the sent pulses are coupled in, the magnitude of the atomic coherence increases. As echo pulses are coupled out, the magnitude decreases. Decay due to other processes is apparent at other times. As the atomic coherence increases, the coupling in also increases due to the interference effect. This is apparent both as the larger increase in the atomic coherence at each coupling and as the decrease in the leakage of the sent pulse. Eventually, the other loss processes balance the increase, and equilibrium is reached.

We have also looked at two kink configurations for even n (at odd n such configurations would have infinite energy). In the Sine-Gordon models kinks repel (although some people argues that they go through each other). The preliminary results show that the same is true for other values of even n. In fig. 8 we present the trajectories obtained by us in two simulations (both started at d = 9 and with the same velocity v = 0.5. In fig 8a we present the trajectory for the Sine Gordon case n = 2 and in fig 8b - for n = 4. We see very little difference although the repulsion is stronger in the n = 4 case. We observed the same results for other values of v and for different values of d. In fig 9 we show similar results for the case of v = 0 (this time started at a smaller d - at d = 9 but the repulsion is much weaker). Clearly we see repulsion in both cases. In our simulations we took the initial conditions as the superpositions of two kinks with velocity ±v in their centre of mass.

In this paper we have presented a novel interpretation for the large-order behaviour of finite-temperature perturbation theory. In particular we have shown that a fixed large order in the perturbation series for the partition function of an anharmonic oscillator defines a non-trivial statistical mechanical model with a sensible thermodynamic limit. The model exhibits two phases separated by a second-order phase transition and it is important to establish the universality class to which this critical behaviour belongs. Although this transition has the same interpretation as the BKT transition in the two-dimensional XY model, the latter is a transition of infinite order having no discontinuities in the derivatives of the free energy.

For both types of deep networks, we can ask again how test set error depends on batch size. Figure 16 shows that for both types of deep networks and across a range of hidden layers, the best achievable test set error generally increases with increasing batch size.

The AFDMC calculations have been performed for different values of the parameters characterizing the hyperon-nucleon interaction. Despite the estimates of the Λ separation energies are still rather noisy, it was possible to determine a set of values of the potential parameters by which the experimental data are roughly reproduced at the same time for 5ΛHe and 17 Λ O. With this set of parameters we gave a preliminary estimate of the separation energies by both including and excluding the YNN term in the Hamiltonian. Notice that we are making the strong assumption that the separation energy, being the difference of two terms, is not strongly influenced by the quality of the nucleon-nucleon Hamiltonian that we employ in our calculations.
Second we have trained a Random Forests regression model that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The number of trees in the forest was set to 100 with no restriction on the depth of the tree and all features are used.

In order to make progress with this problem, it is of fundamental importance to control the bifurcations of limit cycles that can take place when one or several parameters of the system are varied. The word bifurcation is used to describe any sudden change that occurs while parameters are being smoothly varied in any dynamical system. Connections with the theory of bifurcations penetrate all natural phenomena. The differential equations describing real physical systems always contain parameters whose exact values are, as a rule, unknown. If an equation modeling a physical system is structurally instable, that is if the behavior of its solutions may change qualitatively through arbitrary small changes in its right-hand side, then it is necessary to understand which bifurcations of its phase portrait may occur through changes of the parameters.
Simulating pedestrians we are in a similar situation. If with given constraints for every point in time, every position, and every destination the exact remaining travel time was known for every type of pedestrian, it would in fact not be necessary to simulate anymore. For what would be the additional information one could gain from such a simulation? The simulation would be more or less a discrete representation or instance of the multi-dimensional field of remaining travel times. Furthermore such a simulation would show an optimal solution which most probably would not be a realistic one.

By assuming that very dense matter is made of weakly interacting quarks, one could try to understand the thermodynamic properties of the corresponding ground state by first completely neglecting the interaction between quarks. In order to construct the ground state, it is important to keep in mind that quarks are fermions, i.e., particles with a half-integer spin, s = 1/2. They should obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits for two identical fermions to occupy the same quantum state.

Mathematical modelers often need to make decisions on how to model transmission and loss immunity mechanisms, so it is critical to understand the robustness and sensitivity of results to realistic variations in model structures. Toward that end, we have examined how model uncertainty and misspecification affect parameter estimates, model fits, and model forecasting ability. We considered five deterministic SIWR-based model structures, each including different hypothesized mechanisms of cholera transmission and loss of immunity, using both simulated data and data from the 2006 cholera epidemic in Angola. We found that goodness-of-fit criteria were unable to distinguish misspecified model fits from those of the true model for simulated epidemic data, and that forecasting from short-term data of one month or less was universally poor, even when the model that generated the data and the model that produced the forecast were the same. However, model fits for long-term data were found to be specific to the type of waning immunity that was implemented (i.e., exponential- vs. gamma-distributed waning immunity). Moreover, some parameters were consistently estimated across all models and datasets, suggesting that it may be possible to estimate some parameters even when the underlying mechanistic model is unknown.

We have performed far-field infrared ellipsometry and reflectance measurements on VO2 films across the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) and have determined the evolution of the effective optical constants. In addition, we have investigated the IMT with scanning near-field infrared microscopy and have directly observed the percolative phase transition. A combination of the far-field and near-field results within the ambit of the Bruggeman effective medium theory uncovers enhanced effective mass in the incipient metallic islands at the onset of the IMT. This result signifies the pivotal role of electronic correlations in the IMT physics.

Another important effect, particularly for the low frequency instruments, is that of direction dependent gains. In most radio telescopes, the gain of the antenna is largely a function of the direction angles relative to the pointing direction. This is described by the pattern of the primary beam, A(l, m), where l and m are direction cosines relative to the pointing direction. However, there is also some dependence on the absolute pointing direction of the telescope relative to the ground, making the pattern of the primary beam a function of the zenith angle, Z, and parallactic angle, χ, as well. For electronically steered low frequency telescopes such as the MWA, highly accurate compensation for this effect is a key issue.

If an antagonistic game admits equilibrium situations, then the equilibrium values corresponding to them coincide and are equal to the maxmin value. Equilibrium strategies of an antagonistic game are maxmin and they are called optimal, while ε-equilibrium values are ε-maxmin and they are called ε-optimal.

In any case, our simple analysis shows how a hot, gravoturbulent disk can easily sustain accretion rates orders of magnitude higher than those of cold, non-fragmenting protogalactic disks considered in recent literature, hence allowing naturally the formation of central supermassive objects without drainage of gas by star formation. These particular conditions arise naturally in the highly perturbed nuclear disk emerging from a galaxy merger, and should indeed be interpreted as a byproduct of the starburst itself. Thus, in our model star formation has indeed a positive role in allowing the direct collapse since it provides enough heating to prevent large-scale fragmentation.

We have studied the effects of DM self-interactions in collisions of galaxy clusters with particular focus on the resulting separation between the DM halo of the sub-cluster and the collisionless galaxies. In our analysis we have made the distinction between frequent collisions with small momentum transfer and rare collisions with large momentum transfer. Only when the fraction of expulsive collisions f is much smaller than unity, is it possible to have frequent DM self-interactions without violating observational constraints on the evaporation rate. When this is the case, DM self-interactions can be described by an effective drag force. However when f is large, DM self-interactions must be rare and an effective description of collective effects is not possible since only some fraction of the DM particles are affected at all. Overall we find significant differences between these two classes of DM self-interactions concerning both qualitative and quantitative predictions. It is therefore important to make a clear distinction between them.

One of the main problems encountered by videoconference users is the presence of acoustic echo. Sound produced by the loudspeakers is received by the microphones and sent back to the remote users. This creates an echo, as users hear the sound of their own voice with a delay. As videoconferencing applications incorporate higher sampling rates and multiple channels, the problem of cancelling acoustic echo becomes harder. One of the main difficulty in stereo echo cancellation is the strong correlation that exists between the left and right channel, making it harder or even impossible to estimate the echo filter.

We thus developed the IRF to take advantage of the strictly periodic nature of planetary transits (in the absence of additional bodies in the system) to isolate the transit signal more effectively, following a method similar to the TFA algorithm previously developed for the reconstruction of transits in the presence of systematics. We evaluated the performance of the IRF relative to the NIF and the no variability light curves by comparing a) the transit parameters from trapezoidal fits, b) the star-planet parameters from analytic transit fits, and c) the light curves themselves by visual examination. The results can be summarised as follows: the transits reconstructed with the IRF are systematically closer to the no variability case than the NIF-processed transits, and the improvement in the transit depth and duration can be very significant particularly in cases with large amplitude, high frequency stellar variability. However, the full transit fits are affected by other factors including instrumental noise and the well known degeneracy between system scale and impact parameter, which dominate the final parameter estimates in approximately one third of the cases in our sample, or about half of the cases where the IRF provided a visual improvement over the NIF.

A tunneling current is injected into the dot via the oxide barrier from the top (source at x = 0) and leaves the dot at the bottom (drain at x = d). Due to the presence of the oxide barriers this current is non-ballistic and non-thermal.

We concentrate on what happens between these effective source and drain (Fig. 2).

Abstract We show how the method of separation of variables can be used to construct integrable models corresponding to curves describing vacuum structure of four-dimensional N = 2 SUSY Yang-Mills theories. We use this technique to construct models corresponding to SU(N) Yang-Mills theory with Nf < 2N matter hypermultiplets by generalising the periodic Toda lattice. We also show that some special cases of massive SU(3) gauge theory can be equivalently described by the generalisations of the Goryachev-Chaplygin top obtained via separation of variables.

A known issue that can impact the KSP calculations is beaming and other instrumental correlation effects. In this paper we use only a single WMAP band CMB map for K-map calculations, therefore the beaming effect of different bands are not relevant. The mean value of the K-map varies very slightly between different bands if the Galactic disk region is not taken into account. Also the beaming effect adds some unexpected Gaussian noise into the CMB data. So it hardly has any effect on the K-map calculations aimed at detecting strong departure from a Gaussian distribution.
An effective QCD Hamiltonian in the light-front gauge has been obtained, solving flow equations for the two lowest Fock sectors selfconsistently. It has been shown that it is possible to eliminate the minimal quark-gluon interaction by using continuous unitary transformation. This elimination causes the renormalization of the coupling functions of the Hamiltonian described by the flow equations. In the two lowest Fock sectors this change of the couplings corresponds to the renormalization of the one-particle energies and to the generation of effective interactions between quarks, in particular quark-antiquark interaction. In oder to set up these differential equations the generated new interactions, with more than three intermediate states, have to be neglected. Truncating in number of particles participating in intermediate states is not equivalent to perturbation theory in coupling constant, but rather is close to Tamm-Dancoff approach.

The second type of approach is used to determine whether the genes within a set associate more strongly with the outcome of interest than they would by chance, had they been independent of the outcome. Methods that test this self-contained null hypothesis usually judge statistical significance by randomizing the phenotype with respect to expression data and assume that gene sets are fixed. While we acknowledge that the competitive hypothesis is often of interest, we focus on methods that test the self-contained hypothesis in this paper.

As can be seen from the plots in Figure 1, MVP tree outperforms VP tree. Each leaf node entry in the MVP tree stores its distance to the first 10 ancestors. These precomputed distances help in reducing the search cost as compared to VP tree. In addition, MVP tree needs two vantage points to partition the data space into four regions whereas VP tree requires three vantage points for the same. This further reduces the number of distance computations at the internal nodes at search time. The left partition obtained using vantage point Sv1 is partitioned again using the farthest point Sv2 which is present in the right partition. Also, for smaller values of the edit distances (≤ 0.4) the internal node comparisons dominate the results. In case of the MVP tree, since there are multiple keys at each internal node, it results in more distance computations as compared to the FH and FQ tree, which have one fixed key per level. This explains the crossover in the curves of the FQ tree, FH tree and MVP tree at search distance 0.4.
To summarize, we emphasize that the Fe II samples due to QRL and LCMD, taken at face value at the separate z values, reinforce the oscillatory behavior as illustrated in CSPA1. We admit, however, that the strongest support comes from a single data point at z = 1.84 (LCMD). We still notice that this data point happens to occur at z around which we find the peak behavior crucially important to reveal the oscillatory structure in CSPA1. This latter analysis might be subject, however, to future improvement with respect to the accuracy, as was argued in the most recent version (v3) of LCMD. We must be open to a more conventional wisdom that the required accuracy has not been fully realized yet to establish the presence of a peak unambiguously. In order to determine if the oscillatory time-dependence of α is in fact justified, we urge that an emphasis should be placed in the future analysis to make careful measurement at different z values even for relatively sparse data points.

Lab #3: Visibility Function for a Pair of Sources
The DFT results show the presence of an anisotropic Dirac cone in SrMnBi2. But, in CaMnBi2 the band crossing occurs along a continuous line in momentum space. From the TB analysis, we conclude that the anisotropic potential created by the Sr atoms is a main factor for the anisotropic Dirac band. Our study indicates that the nature of the Dirac dispersion is sensitive to the nearest neighbor interaction in the Bi square net. So, it would be interesting to investigate the Dirac nature of the Bi square net with further changes, such as structural distortions or magnetism.

It is straightforward to see that pi pj is a 12-pattern in p if and only if pi is a left-descendant of pj in T(p). On the other hand, pj pi is a 21-pattern in p if and only if either pi is a right descendant of pj in T(p) or there is a vertex x in T(p) so that pj is a left descendant of x and pi is a right descendant of x. In the previous section we gave an exhaustive list of the ways in which 213-patterns and 231-patterns can occur in a 132-avoiding permutation.

From Tables 1 and 2, we see that the clustering using residue pair counts of either MJ or BLOSUM is not completely hierachical. That is, clusters formed in an early step need not be preserved in a latter step. Such a reversal case exists for both MJ and BLOSUM, but is rare for both.
In conclusion, we have carefully performed the first Monte Carlo studies for the 3-state Potts model on the Sierpinski carpet with df ≃ 1.8928. Although the system exhibits strong scaling corrections, the consistency of our results demonstrates the validity of the finite size scaling theory for the q-state Potts model on these fractal lattices. Nevertheless, scaling corrections tend to increase while q is passing from 2 (Ising model) to 3. We, hence, expect the raise of these difficulties in the studies of the phase transition while q goes larger. In the coming future, we will be able to perform in a reliable way the studies for the Potts model with larger q on fractal dimensions higher than 2.

Note that a massless scalar field is a particular instance of stiff matter. Therefore, in a generic situation, a Chaplygin cosmology can be looked upon as interpolating between different phases of the universe: from a dust dominated universe to a de Sitter one passing through an intermediate phase which is the mixture just mentioned above. The interesting point, however, is that such an evolution is accounted for by using one fluid only.

We presented a study on using a covariance matrix computation for absorbing the pileup noise and thus improving energy reconstruction in the TileCal. The results show that the OF1 method taking the pedestal value from the data base and using such covariance matrix is the most suitable method for online energy reconstruction in TileCal for LHC Run 2. The pedestal value is computed through special pedestal runs, and both the covariance matrix and the OF weights are computed offline, and loaded into the digital signal processor available in the Readout Driver for online energy estimation.

In the solar wind the body of the spacecraft provides a barrier to the bulk flow. Directly downstream of the spacecraft a wake is formed that contains large electric fields, which dominate the signal and are measured each time one of the EFI probes enters the wake. The wake shows up as large discontinuous jumps in the time series making it possible to automatically detect and remove these periods. Approximately 30% of the data points are removed by this process.

We believe that deep learning of representations using autoencoders can be accomplish in this framework. That being said, the techniques will certainly share some properties with those based on neural nets (hopefully the impressive results), where we already know that there is a significant difference between discrete and continuous cases. For example, using binary outputs, there is no gradient and things like hamming distance are a poor substitute. In some future work we will investigate an autoencoder and we are very optimistic this will leads to interesting results.

In this paper we estimate the angular broadening of a compact continuum radio source due to various components of the IGM for a range of source and scattering screen redshifts. The models are based on an extension of the thin screen scattering model of the ISM to cosmological scales, assuming Kolmogorov turbulence for the IGM. The model predictions were used together with observational constraints obtained from the most compact extragalactic sources known to discuss the feasibility and prospects of detecting scatter broadening in the IGM. The main conclusions can be summarised as follows:
The original idea of permutation tests was that all possible permutations would be enumerated (Fisher, 1935). However mt can be very large indeed for moderate to large sample sizes, so that complete enumeration may be impractical. In this situation, it is common practice to examine a random subset of the possible permutations. It is important to distinguish two possible scenarios. The random permutations may be drawn without replacement, so that all permutations are distinct. Or permutations may be drawn with replacement, so that the same permutation may be used more than once. We consider the first scenario now. The second scenario is the topic of the next section.

is excluded, planar coordinates are interesting in physics. In its early stage, the universe is generally believed to be through a phase of inflation, which can be described by a de Sitter spacetime in planar coordinates. On the other hand, recent cosmological observations indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, so the future of our universe may well be again described by a de Sitter spacetime in these coordinates. In this section, it will be used to study the positive mass theorem for P-asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes in a mathematically rigorous and complete way.

A final confirmation of the nature of the excess will require more detailed studies. In particular, one has to show that the new particles decay to the third generation quarks. This task may turn out to be very difficult at the LHC if a mass difference between stop and chargino is very small. In such a case, the final confirmation would require a linear collider with a much higher sensitivity to soft objects. It would be a very interesting scenario for such a machine, with a few new particles in the kinematical reach, allowing for a high precision study of their properties.

The outer lobes of both the DDRGs do not have any compact hotspots, but the inner lobes do have compact hotspots at the outer ends of the lobes. From the widely accepted dynamical models of FR II radio galaxies, the lack of hotspots in outer lobes suggests that the lobes are no longer fed by the jets. Therefore, these lobes are the relics of the previous episode of JFA. Since the inner lobes do have compact hotspots, they are still fed by the newly formed jets in the current episode of JFA. The different values of the spectral ages (135 and 92 Myr for NW and SE lobes respectively) of two outer lobes of J1158+2621 are most probably due to the different energy loss/gain processes other than synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses (e.g., adiabatic expansion loss and particle re-acceleration), that are/were at work in the outer lobes. This essentially suggests the asymmetry on two different sides of a source. Similarly asymmetric ages in other DDRGs have been reported by Konar et al. (2012). Assuming that both the jets started and stopped simultaneously, the meaningful spectral age of a RG should therefore be an average of the spectral ages of two lobes. The average spectral age of J1158+2621 is 113 Myr, which we consider to be the age of the outer double of J1158+2621. In the age-distance plot of J1158+2621, we observe a curvature when smooth curves were drawn through the points. This curvature in the age distance plot can be produced by the increasing adiabatic loss with the age of any strip of the lobe plasma. In such a scenario, the closer the strip to the core, the older it is, hence the more adiabatic loss due to expansion it might have suffered. Alternatively, if the hotspot advance speed was accelerating (because of the decreasing ambient medium density) then such a curvature is possible. The concave curvature may also indicate that the back-flow speed of the cocoon plasma is slowing down as the plasma approaches the core. In practice, all these factors are likely to play a role to various extents in producing curvature such as we observe.

is easily satisfied.
The second ingredient involves bounds on moments of the integrator that are uniform in the time-step size. These bounds enabled the local error estimates to be extended to global error estimates, and hence, pathwise convergence on finite time-intervals. These bounds are automatic if initial conditions are restricted to the known equilibrium distribution the Metropolis-adjusted integrator is designed to sample. To relax this restriction on initial conditions, geometric ergodicity played a key role to obtain such bounds. MALA is often ergodic, but because its proposal chain is often transient, is not geometrically ergodic. This transience is due to a numerical instability in forward Euler for large energy values. By suitably truncating the drift at high energy values, one can ensure the proposal dynamics is not transient. MALA with truncated drift, or MALTA is known to often be geometrically ergodic on infinite time-intervals where MALA is not. The paper used this property to prove MALTA is pathwise convergent on finite time-intervals without a restriction on its initial condition. We remark that MALTA can be generalized to explicit higher-order, multistep and adaptive integrators for overdamped and inertial Langevin equations.

Category 4: There are observations which do not have direct relation to black holes. In fact, systems with neutron stars and black holes do exhibit them. But it would be the best if the accretion flow model, which explains Category 1-3 observations also explains this Category 4 observation to complete satisfaction. Case in point is the formation of jets and outflows. These flows are ubiquitous in any gravitating system. Some disk models, such as standard disks, which have no preferred length scales will produce jets all over the place as in Blandford and Payne (1982) model. However, profuse jets are observed only when the spectrum is hard, i.e., when the Keplerian disk component is weak. Furthermore, the base of the jet has to be less than few tens of Schwarzschild radii (Junor, Biretta & Livio, 1999). Such puzzling situation is beautifully handled by the advective flow model: the CENBOL produces the jet and this is found to be present only in the hard states when the it is not cooled down by the profuse number of soft-photons (Chakrabarti 1999). Also, the CENBOL is a few tens of Schwarzschild radii big. This explains the small base of the jets observed in both the galactic and extragalactic black holes.

Annealing and Etching
With the purpose of performing a second test of the presence of SPUC, we have injected into the crystal a Nd-YAG laser at 1064 nm and a power of 0.51 W, when entering into the crystal, as well. Also in this case we have tuned the entrance angle in order to observe a well visible stimulated emission at 524 nm when both the UV and IR laser are turned on. We have then repeated the same procedure as before: whilst PDC was observable even with a 1/30 of second exposure at 2.8 stop with the argon laser power tuned to 0.48 W, no SPUC appeared up to a 1/2 second exposure with the same stop and the 1064 nm laser at the same power. Unluckily in this case the high-power Nd-YAG laser strongly diffuses into the crystal and creates a strong background for longer exposures: thus we were not able to derive more stringent limits on the ratio between SPUC and SPDC intensities in this case.

The very same inequality may be applied to QED, yielding the result that orthopositronium is heavier than parapositronium. Furthermore, whatever quantum numbers are used at the outset, the inequality is always bounded by the pseudo-scalar correlator, if just the correlator can be written as a single trace of two propagators closing a fermion loop. This shows that the pion is the lowest lying meson of the QCD spectrum.

By relaxing the property (a) above we have arrived at a massless vector field. It has spin 1 and U(1) gauge symmetry. It is thus an Abelian vector field. Like gravity, is this unique? What we have shown above is that dynamics of force will be governed by Maxwell equation which follow from inverse square law and bipolarity of the charge. The only thing that could be different is that there could be some different measure of charge than electric but the dynamics of the force will however be determined by Maxwell equation. There is hence no sensible reason to have two different forces having the same dynamics. Thus electromagnetic force is the unique non-universal long range force.

The results show that for small errors in the coefficients the estimated variance of b1 and b2 is also small and the estimate is realistic. The first case was computed without artificial noise, in this case the accuracy seems to be determined mainly by the statistics program. Adding noise deteriorates the accuracy of the results rapidly. While a relative error of 0.0001 (case 2) still leads to a reasonable result, the tenfold relative error (case 3) already means that the calculated uncertainty of b2 is about 7%. A one-percent inaccuracy in the data (case 4) gives a result even with the first digit uncertain. As case 5 where the number of data-points is raised to 2001 shows, increasing the size of the data-set may at least partially compensate for noise.

Homogeneous nucleation in a supercoled gas of Lennard-Jones particles is obtained by MD simulations. The temperature of the nucleating cluster is for the first time obtained every time step, and the simulations reveal that it is always a small cold cluster which initiates the nucleation. The temperature in a nucleating cluster fluctuates, but the mean temperature of the cluster remains below the temperature in the supersaturated gas until the critical nucleus is created. The temperature of the nucleating cluster changes in a systematic way with the degree of supersaturation. For less supersaturation an even colder cluster starts the nucleation (Table 1, Table 2). The initial results are obtained for five moderate supersaturations at a temperature T = 0.80 between the triple- and critical temperature. We have, however, tested that the dynamics are valid for nucleation of liquid droplets at other temperatures (T = 0.70 and 0.90), but further work needs to be carried out to clarify e.g. whether it also is valid for more complex systems like nucleation of water droplets.

Introduction
The eccentricity distribution depends on whether the planet has a smaller or larger semi-major axis than its parent star. In the case of smaller semi-major axis, the eccentricity distribution is centered at lower eccentricity relative to the parent star, while in the case of larger semi-major axis the eccentricity distribution is centered at higher eccentricity relative to the parent star. In 95% of the runs of set A the eccentricity of the planet orbit ep differs less than 15% from the eccentricity of its parent stares.

To conclude, we describe the behavior of metamolcule driven by the external field. It is shown that fluorescence at dissipation larger than driving is accompanied by narrowing of the spectral line by the order of magnitude and splitting of the Wigner function of the emitted light. This effect may find applications in quantum systems where strong noise due to high losses is unavoidable problem like in plasmonics.
A system is called a scrambler if it dynamically thermalizes in the sense that, if prepared in an atypical state, it evolves towards typicality. That is, even for an initial state that has little or no entanglement between subsystems, the time evolution is such that the reduced density matrices are finally close to thermal density matrices. The scrambling time is simply the characteristic time scale associated to this process. It can be described as the time it takes for a perturbed system, one that is described by a product state, to evolve back into a strongly entangled state. It can also be interpreted as the time necessary to distribute any information entering the system amongst all its constituents.

The choice of the viscosity coefficient is the most difficult and speculative problem of the accterion disc theory. In the laminar case of microscopic (atomic or plasma) viscosity, which is very low, the stationary accretion disc must be very massive and very thick, and before its formation the matter is collected by disc leading to a small flux inside. It contradicts to observations of X-ray binaries, where a considerable matter flux along the accretion disc may be explained only when viscosity coefficient is much larger then the microscopic one. In the paper of Shakura (1972) it was suggested, that matter in the disc is turbulent, what determines a turbulent viscous stress tensor, parametrized by a pressure

These steps are done repeatedly until a random catalogue containing 100 times more galaxies than the genuine catalogue is built up.

Note that this definition of the tfidf measure diverges from the legacy one by the fact that we consider not documents but sentences as basic text units. This is because we compare tfidf-generated CARs to those using syntactic information, and syntax is limited to the sentence level. Therefore, in order to obtain a fair comparison, we have limited term frequency to the sentence level and our “ document frequency” is in fact a sentence frequency.

In conclusion, a microscopic theory of the magnetic-field modulation of the critical current in Josephson junctions has been developed in the present paper. As a generalization of basic microscopic results in the absence of the magnetic field, the modulated Josephson current is explicitly expressed via a secular function or, for symmetric junctions, via a magnetic field dependent spectrum of Andreev interface states. Temperature-dependent deviations of the modulated critical current from the Fraunhofer pattern have been found for short junctions with tunneling through localized electronic states. The deviations depend on transparency distribution over transport channels. For constant transparency the deviations vanish not only near Tc, but also at T = 0. Such behavior qualitatively differs from what is known for long superconductor-normal metal-superconductor junctions. Zero-temperature deviations are found to take place in junctions between different superconductors and in symmetric junctions containing channels with different transparencies. If Dorokhov bimodal distribution of transparency eigenvalues holds, the averaged deviation increases with decreasing temperature and takes its maximum at T = 0. It is shown that in a number of junctions with a pronounced anharmonic current behavior, the Fraunhofer pattern is only slightly distorted.

As the use of software proliferates throughout science, VisTrails seeks to provide infrastructure for integrating varied tools while also capturing the necessary information to ensure reproducibility. In order to best address the needs of scientists, we have collaborated with a number of different projects in order to both show how our work can benefit them but also understand where new ideas are required. As the system has matured, we have adopted a number of standard software engineering practices in order to better maintain and enhance it. Our approach has been to build software with usability in mind, addressing key challenges as science moves to lean more on computing, and this goal has served to provide opportunities for research in computer science as well as end-user domains. Finally, our outreach through tutorials, talks, and publications has both provided opportunities for new collaborations and contributions to communities looking to address similar problems.

In this paper, we develop a new procedural semantics, called SLTNF-resolution, for the well-founded semantics by enhancing Global SLS-resolution with tabling and loop cutting mechanisms. SLTNF-resolution retains the linearity property and makes use of tabling to get rid of all loops and reduce redundant computations. It defines positive and negative loops in terms of two different ancestor-descendant relations, one on subgoals within an SLS-tree and the other on SLS-trees, so that positive and negative loops can be efficiently detected and handled. It employs two effective criteria for answer completion of tabled subgoals so that redundant derivations can be pruned as early as possible. All these mechanisms are integrated into an algorithm quite like that for generating SLS-trees.
In the next section, we describe the proposed scheme, which can be seen as an extension of the latter work to scalable coding.

Observe that for any separating set in a component, a cycle can use one of its vertices to go out of the component and another vertex to come in (this transition is represented by a virtual edge in the component). As any separting set has size at most 3, a cycle can visit a node of the component tree only once. In other words, a cycle can have only one component cycle in any component tree node (this would not be true if we had separating sets of size 4). Also, a component cycle can take only one edge of any virtual triangle.

Summary
Fuchsian techniques can be used to give statements about the singularities of general solutions in a particular class on different levels. In order of increasing sophistication these are as follows. The first level is to prove existence of solutions corresponding to analytic data on the singularity which depend on the same number of free functions as the general solution. The next level is the corresponding statement with smooth rather than analytic data. The final one is to show that the solutions obtained in the second step include all those evolving from a non-empty open set of initial data on a regular Cauchy surface. Proofs on all these levels are available in certain examples.
Consequently,
In this letter, we report the observation of an intermittent behavior for gravity-capillary waves on the surface of a layer of mercury. We show that we need to compute the second-order differences of the surface wave amplitude in order to display intermittency. We observe that the shape of their probability density function changes strongly across the time scales (from a Gaussian at large scales to a stretched exponential shape at short scales). This short-scale intermittency is confirmed by computing the structure functions for various time scales. The structure functions of order p (from 1 to 6) and the flatness are found to be power laws of the time scale on more than one decade. The exponents of the power laws of the structure functions are found to depend nonlinearly on p. All these observations show the intermittent nature of the local slope increments of the turbulent surface waves.
The important item for future R and D works is fabrication of (1) intense lasers with high quality to obtain large excited atom density n for SPAN, and (2) realizing heavy ion circulation with high coherence ρeg for its RENP.

Hence polynomials, exponentials, and trigonometric functions are all polyexp. Using integration by parts and induction, we obtain the following simple observation.
The experimental missing mass spectra, obtained with the carbon target, are rather smooth. This smoothness is caused by both, an essential increase of the contribution of background reactions in the interaction of the proton with the carbon and the Fermi motion of the nucleons in the nucleus. The latter increases essentially the angular cone of the emitted nucleons. In consequence, it is not possible to see peaks of SNDs on the carbon target. As the experiment with the carbon target resulted in the rather smooth spectra, all structures, appearing in the experiment with the CD2 target, have to be attributed to an interaction of the proton with the deuteron.
In what follows we detail the steps needed to prove Theorem B. The proof of Theorem A is similar and technically simpler.

Within the Arctic and Antarctic circles, another problem is encountered: the system of unequal hours becomes ill-defined since the Sun never sets. In the climates provided for such latitudes, I have chosen a definition such that polar days and nights are divided into twelve equal hours between successive midnights. This definition interfaces smoothly with the days at the beginnings and ends of the polar days and nights where the Sun just rises or sets, and the unequal hours of the day or night are infinitesimally short.

If one understands a proof system for program correctness as a theory capable of predicting system behavior in some cases, the need for testing emerges at once: validating or refuting this theory. Looking at it this way, testing is always and in principle in the lead, while program proving is no more than systematic inductive inference on the basis of testing outcomes. Is this view reasonable, and if so, how has it happened that testing became less regarded than verification in principled circles?
To obtain an aggregated measure of performance, we also report the Monte Carlo estimates of the integrated square deviation of the estimators from the theoretical function, i.e.,

The estimator described above explicitly estimates the amplitude fNL and phase φ of the oscillation for a fixed frequency kc. To estimate the oscillation frequency kc, it is necessary to sample the frequency space with the KSW estimator and search for peaks in the significance of the estimated amplitude. We assume the primordial bispectrum to be given by a single oscillation frequency and not a spectrum of contributions. We consider only the sine component of the bispectrum first, meaning that the phase is φ = 0 (see below for the generalisation to the phase). In this case, the estimator for a frequency ki is
Solvability of regular singular systems with small exponents
At positive bias we also observe an abrupt decrease in current at a bias equal to the energy difference between the 1D DoS peak of the zigzag ribbon above the Fermi level and the peak of the armchair ribbon conduction band. The degenerate doping of the armchair ribbon is responsible for the current between conduction band states of both ribbons. Initially, at low bias, the current is significant due to the high DoS near the Fermi level of the zigzag ribbon. The abrupt decrease of current occurs when the high DoS of the zigzag ribbon no longer overlaps with the DoS peak of the armchair ribbon. Essentially, this is the inverse of the effect we have observed in armchair to armchair tunneling.

Of course, in this respect the superfield off-shell formulation could be very useful. Unfortunately, at present we do not have a such formulation at hands.

This apparent breakdown has prompted us to reexamine the scaling hypothesis for models with multiple absorbing states. We arrive at a scaling theory in which additional exponents are expected to depend upon the starting configuration, and in which the exponents satisfy a generalized hyperscaling relation. The latter is verified in simulations of the DR and of a new model called the threshold transfer process. In what follows we define the models, present the scaling theory, and report the numerical evidence supporting it.
For example, for m = 8, we have

Multiplex is a natural transition from network as a model to preserve the rich relational properties in the data. Each of the networks refers to a distinct relationship in the complex system, e.g. a transportation complex system has different modes of transport and each type can be represented by one of the networks in the multiplex.

Notice that the second and third order approximations to Veff(x) are unbounded from below, hence physically nonsensical. Therefore, like the expansion in powers of λ, the expansion in powers of β cannot be truncated at an arbitrary order, but only at those orders for which the resulting approximation to Veff(x) is bounded from below.

On the other hand, in an expanding universe with scale factor a(t) (t is the cosmological time), Λ is a constant, while the matter density ρm falls with a3. Therefore, it is an important problem to understand why the observed matter density is so close to the vacuum energy density. This second question is usually referred to as the cosmic coincidence problem.
Both particles will reach the same maximum eccentricity emax under the influence of Kozai-Lidov perturbations from the companion, so we can integrate over eccentricity to emax to find the relative velocity between particles on adjacent orbits:

Conclusions
DD methods are often mentioned in connection with parallel processing. The equations of different domains can, in principle, be solved in parallel by different processors. However, the different domains that arise in many practical situations do not necessarily lead to an optimal load-balancing assignment of equations to processors. With the GS approach, inherently parallel algorithms such as Bi-CGSTAB and GMRES can be implemented efficiently in parallel without regard to subdomain boundaries. Needless to say, GS is inherently parallel.
This stronger soft-covering lemma gives a very strong assurance that soft-covering will hold. Even if the codebook needs to satisfy exponentially many constraints related to soft-covering, the union bound will yield the claim that a codebook exists which satisfies them all simultaneously. Indeed, if you ran the soft-covering experiment exponentially many times, regardless of how the codebooks are correlated from one experiment to the next, the probability of seeing even one fail is still doubly-exponentially small.

In this paper we present a graphical representation of regression performance based on a very usual view of operating condition, in regression. Many regression applications have deployment contexts where over-estimations are not equally costly as under-estimations (or vice versa). This is called the loss asymmetry. Loss asymmetry is just a kind of operating condition (or one of its constituents), but a very important one in many applications.
Another aspect to be mentioned is the behavior of the marginal distribution due to canonical transformation of position and momentum qk, pk, i.e., of the real and imaginary parts of the wave functions. First, let us consider linear canonical transformations

The inclusion SU(3) ⊂ G2 allows one to pass from an SU(3)-structure in dim = 6 to a G2-structure in dim = 7. In the same vein, the inclusion SU(3) × SU(3) ⊂ G2 × G2 relates generalised SU(3)- to generalised G2 -structures. In this final section we want to render this link explicit in both the spinorial and the form picture of a generalised structure. We first discuss the algebraic setup before we turn to integrability issues.

Quantum Mechanics (QM) allows to encode and process information in ways inaccessible to classical theories with non-contextual hidden variables. One such strictly quantum resource is entanglement, a phenomenon in which individual parts of a quantum system can be described only in reference the other ones. There are multiple consequences of entanglement. The fundamental one is the exclusion of theories with local hidden variables (LHVTs, where non-contextuality is justified by spatial separation). The practical ones are advantages in various communication tasks, as compared to classical protocols. Examples of such advantage include security of cryptographic key distribution or secret sharing, or communication complexity reduction in a distributed computing system.

Cook et al. (1995) have implemented an N-body accelerator on the Altera RIPP-10 board which contains eight Altera FLEX 81188 FPGAs plus 2MB of static RAM. This accelerator employs a direct method inverse-square law force calculator pipelined across all eight FPGAs. The arithmetic implemented (Louca et al. 1996) is single precision IEEE compatible floating point. Using a digit-serial approach, Louca was able to achieve a peak performance of 2.5 Mflops per floating point multiplier, which is the rate limiting operator. The entire system of 8 FPGAs runs at 10 MHz to deliver 2.5 million force calculations per second, for a peak performance of 40 Mflops.
GRBs are the most powerful transients in the Universe, releasing of order 1051 erg of energy in shocks produced in a relativistic jet. The jets are formed during stellar collapse at the death of a massive star and the birth of a new black hole and supernova (collapsar); some GRBs may arise from compact object mergers. We are alerted to the onset of a GRB by a huge release of γ-rays, with the energy output typically peaking around 1 MeV, lasting anywhere between one and several hundred seconds. Some of these events are now being recorded with Fermi to beyond 10 GeV.

It is notable that p = ζ for d = 1 for both the usual Ising model, where ζ = 1/2, and for our system of interfering paths with ζ = 2/3. This implies that at long times the average size of all domains, including the domains that have vanished, becomes time-independent. This is occurring because the two domain walls, once well-separated, are moving independently with no bias to increase or decrease the size of the domain. Thus although the finite negative domain has appeared within an infinite positive domain, in the event that the negative domain grows large, this initial condition is apparently asymptotically forgotten locally at the two domain walls.

Observe that
Since the standard 2-parametric Chaplygin gas model causes too much acceleration, we propose to combine it with the standard 2-parametric self-decelerating DGP model, taking the cross-over length scales to be proportional. The proportionality constant subsequently disappears because of a normalizing condition at z = 0. Thus the model has only one parameter more than the standard ΛCDM model.

The halting problem and other noncomputable functions are preceded by an aura of being a pathology, a nuisance ... eventually, something negative. This is the perspective of non-specialists. On the contrary, we may consider this undecidability as a sort of intrinsic randomness in Mathematics. This is analogous to the intrinsic randomness that quantum theory brought to Physics even earlier in the history of Science. Now we know from Quantum Information Theory (QIT) that this randomness can be used to our benefit, in a large variety of ways. Similarly, It is very remarkable how Chaitin turns the problem of non-computability in algorithmic complexity into a source of creativity in order to challenge living organisms to evolve by becoming increasingly more advanced. This process of challenging by means of mutations is endless precisely because the fitness function employed is non-computable and cannot be bounded when truncated, as we learn from AIT. Thus, non-computability is given a positive role in a descriptive version of biological evolution.

A simple way to defend against impersonation attacks is to lift the restriction against using cryptography. We suggest a one-way variant of the Echo protocol as an alternative. Although it is limited to sending short messages to the verifier when no reply is expected, it is resistant against impersonation attacks, while still maintaining the low resource requirements and spontaneity of the original Echo protocol.

The most decisive reason why Kamioka was selected as the detector site for LISM was that the seismic noise level in the underground facility is extremely low with few artificial seismic excitations. The quiet environment there is an overwhelming benefit for a suspended-mass laser interferometer because the stability of the system depends largely on the lack of seismic and other environmental disturbances. For the laser interferometer once technical noise are suppressed, the spectral sensitivity at the lowest frequency region (typically below a few 10 Hz) is expected to be limited by the seismic noise even after the attenuation by the vibration isolation systems, so low-level seismic noise is quite important in this frequency region. In addition, slow motion of the ground below 1 Hz, including micro-seismic noise, also plays an important role for stable operation of laser interferometer. The rms value of the seismic displacement in this frequency region affects lock acquisition, stability, and robustness of the lock. This is because the suspension systems, which have an eigenfrequency of about 1 Hz, cannot be expected to have sufficient isolation at and below that frequency.
We will show step by step, that the surjectivity of
We illustrate the ideas of real path quantum theory in toy models. In these models, the generalized path integral rules we consider give a simple and physically reasonable ontology. In general, they make different experimental predictions to those made by standard quantum theory. These differences can be small enough to be undetectable in microscopic interference experiments but large enough to predict that macroscopic objects follow definite classical trajectories, even in experiments where quantum theory predicts they should display interference.
We have carried out a comparison between time-dilution with HPE and the one-end trick only for strange quark loops. We expect the one-end trick to perform better for light quarks since HPE is less suited, while for heavier masses time-dilution combined with HPE may become advantageous due to the HPE. Another reason to favor the one-end trick method is for the case of one-derivative operators. To compute such derivative operators in time one requires the fermion loops at at least three neighboring time-slices. For the one-end trick this requires no further inversions since one obtains the loops at all time-slices, however for time-dilution, where an inversion is required at every time-slice, this triples the computational cost.

A microcanonical statistical study of the reaction H+3 + H2 has been published recently (Park & Light 2007). This treatment is being applied to the deuterated isotopologues, but the state-to-state reaction probabilities for H2 D+ + H2 have not yet been calculated (Hugo et al. 2007). In the present paper the collisional coefficients were calculated using a modification of the Oka & Epp (2004) model. The coefficients are normalized to conform with the available chemical data on the nuclear spin-changing reactions. The assumptions and parameter values used in the calculation are available in the appendix. The approximation corresponds to the canonical approach discussed in Hugo et al. (2007).

We first confirmed that the unreduced system would exhibit all types of chimeras predicted by our analysis, and that they would correspond to stable states, for various points in parameter space. These states were observed with both Nσ = 20 and Nσ = 200 oscillators per population. The observed behavior is that the system first goes through a tiny transient and reach an attracting state which was confirmed to be stable even for long computation times. The transient may be explained by the fact that the system, due to its finite size, can only be approximately on to the OA-manifold (or a member of the OA-family, as explained in the Discussion).

To assess how reasonable this interpretation is, we have considered two-field models as the simplest multi-field generalisations, and have looked at ways in which these models can behave differently from their single field counterparts. Given that the two-field slow-roll inflation and the curvaton scenario have been studied recently, we have concentrated on the Modulated Reheating (mr) and the Inhomogeneous End of Inflation (iei) scenarios. Employing a geometrical approach, we have shown that these two scenarios are very similar, though not identical.

We do not want to suppress the fact that there are other ways to define symmetries of linear programs. Apart from the question whether to consider affine or linear transformations, another important subject needs to be put up for discussion. As already mentioned in the introduction, the original motivation for the study of such symmetries was the unnecessarily large size of the branch-and-cut trees caused by symmetric solutions sharing the same utility value. Hence, we should focus on operations that leave invariant the utility vector and the feasible region, which is the polyhedron described by the inequality system of the linear program. Now obviously, many different inequality systems give rise to the same polyhedron. Therefore, the invariance of an inequality system implies the invariance of the polyhedron, but the reverse is not true, as the following example illustrates:
Based on these results, it is reasonable to make the following conjecture.

Derivation from OPE
In our context, it is natural to reverse the notion of a Segal algebra as follows.
Statisticians usually prefer to deal with errors across samples or in regression situations which are independent and identically distributed. In particular there is a strong preference for homoscedasticity (equal variances) across all the noise levels. This is not the case when we have unequal sample sizes and variations in the accuracy across instruments. A standard way of dealing with heteroscedastic noise is to try to decompose the sources of heterogeneity and apply transformations that make the noise variance almost constant. These are called variance stabilizing transformations.
We investigated this numerically. Our data, based on 10,000 experiments for each of 10-sided, 20-sided, 30-sided, 40-sided, and 50-sided dice, is below.

Introduction
Figure 1 shows the zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) magnetisation data as a function of temperature in a field of 100 Oe. A sharp rise in the ZFC magnetisation below 240 K is considered as the signature of ferromagnetic ordering. Below the Curie temperature, FC magnetisation value is different from the ZFC value. Figure 2 shows hysteresis loop at 5 K. The loop is similar to that of a ferromagnet with small coercive force and remanence.
This technique is not appropriate at the lower frequencies in the range of 10 MHz, because the size of the cavity, which is determined by the wavelength of the oscillating field, becomes impracticable. But, going back to the bases of the interaction between the gamma ray photon and the nucleus, mediated by an external applied field, we see that all that is necessary for the interaction mediated by the magnetic sublevels is the presence of a magnetic field H2, oscillating with the frequency ω2. Currents oscillating in conductors create such magnetic fields, which are not electromagnetic waves. We have in fact an LC circuit, and, if we assume the volume of the capacitor and of the inductor to be comparable, then the amplitude of the magnetic field in the inductor is comparable (in CGS units) to the amplitude of the electric field in the capacitor. A magnetic field of 100 Gauss corresponds to an electric field of 100 stat volt/cm, or 30 kV/cm. The energy periodically transferred between the inductor and capacitor is H2/8π erg/cm3. Assuming H=100 Gauss, a volume of 102 cm3, and a Q-factor of the LC circuit of 100, the input power in the circuit is, at a frequency of 100 MHz, of about 1 kW. The equivalent energy flux Φ2 corresponding to the field H2 of 100 Gauss is of about 106 W/cm2.

To see whether the appearance of these massless modes indeed signals a real instability, we will now turn to the full non-linear theory and try to explicitly construct the new ground state to which the system would evolve as a consequence of the instability. As the perturbative analysis suggests that vector components in the internal S3 direction are first to condense, we will start the analysis of the new ground state by turning on only those components. We will later, for comparison, also analyse possible ground states due to condensation of the other fluctuations, and verify that those always have higher energy than the scalar condensate.

In networks of papers and their cited sources, citation links (links between a publication and the sources it cites) are thematically more homogenous than nodes (papers), and thus provide better information for clustering, than the papers themselves. While papers commonly belong to more than one scientific topic, many citation links can be assumed to be homogenous in that the link between paper and source belongs to only one topic. Scientific topics are known to overlap pervasively, which means that their reconstruction as communities of papers must reflect this pervasive overlap. Topics are also locally emergent phenomena in that they represent coinciding and mutually referring perspectives of researchers (the authors of the papers).
For the determination of the amount of ions in the trap, images are taken by the EMCCD camera. These images contain the count distribution C(h, v) with {h, v} denoting the pixel position in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively. In the following, we describe a fast, real-time image analysis used to determine the number of ions and their positions. Compared to a standard off-line two dimensional Gaussian fit, our real time method allows for a fast feedback, with a slightly reduced position accuracy.

The rate of acquisition of HM concentration Cp by the plant with respect to the environmental HM concentration Cs, dCp/dCs, can thus be formulated as driven by two mutually antagonistic forces: (1) the unimpeded increase of Cp when the environmental and the metal concentrations within the plant are small and (2) the restriction to further metal ingress due to a substantial concentration of metal already within the plant. Accordingly in the general case,

Overall, the SRVC has stimulated a wide variety of excellent research in our group by forcing us to examine object recognition in a realistic setting.

The following two sections introduce a natural tension in the crowdsourcing architecture between the trade off of speed vs quality. We introduce two methods to document the trade off that we can expect out of systems of this type. One method is what we call one-shot labeling. In one-shot labeling the system attempts to collect the label as fast as possible. The other method, called Rollover Labeling, attempts to reliably get a label in the presence of noisy, error prone, crowd responses by rolling over the result from one crowdsourcing participant to another in an attempt to correct and clarify previous labels.

At the heart of every candidate theory of quantum gravity is an attempt to understand the structure of space-time at very short distances. The reason is a simple gedanken experiment: the latest when trying to resolve distances as small as the Planck scale the accompanying energy-momentum fluctuations due to the uncertainty relation should cause curvature fluctuations large enough to significantly disturb the very space-time distance which one attempts to resolve. Speculations about the resulting behavior of space-time at small distances have ranged from the idea that space-time is discrete, to that it is foam-like, to that space-time may be a derived concept with a highly dynamical short-distance structure, as e.g. string theory would suggest. At least at present, however, there is no experimental access to sufficiently small scales, and therefore, a priori, the short-distance structure of space-time could still be any one out of infinitely many possibilities.

The detector will be operated underground.
In this manuscript, we use data on political party affiliation in Germany from 2006 to demonstrate the usefulness of a semiparametric extension of the basic MNL model in this context. We compare our results to corresponding results obtained from fitting a parametric MNL model, thereby demonstrating the superiority of the more flexible semiparametric approach when analyzing this kind of data. The increase in flexibility offered by the semiparametric approach allows us to identify complex voter profiles with respect to age, income, gender and region, with high nonlinearity in the covariate effects and strong interaction between different covariates. This data structure can most naturally be modelled by considering multidimensional nonparametric functions of covariates. We explore a model fitting approach based on kernel smoothing and a profile likelihood algorithm. The key accomplishments of this manuscript thus are: 1) a detailed analysis of a complex electorate, demonstrating the usefulness of flexible regression models in this context, and 2) the presentation of an original, kernel-based approach for the estimation of semiparametric MNL models.

An asymmetry in this model is that multiple questions can receive the same answer, but multiple answers cannot hold for the same question (in the same position). This is a consequence of the requirement that P be a function. This restriction may be removed by making P a set-valued function, or multifunction, ranging over the power set of A. We might then distinguish positions in which multiple answers are assigned to single questions as those satisfying the condition

The axion scenario is the most convincing solution to the strong CP problem. Similarly to the previous section, however, the axion scenario also needs the intermediate scale that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken at.

The bulk of extragalactic very high-energy γ-ray sources is composed of blazars. These sources are also bright emitters of synchrotron radiation from radio to X rays, witnessing the presence of strong magnetic fields. They are therefore prime targets in the search for ALPs. In this study, γ/ALP oscillations in the source are assumed to be in the strong mixing regime. This assumption is verified if

We also consider a pair M := (M, gM) where gM is a pseudo-Riemannian metric of signature (p, q) on a manifold M of dimension m = p + q. One says M is Riemannian if p = 0 and Lorentzian if p = 1. Let RM be the associated Riemann curvature tensor. We say that U is a 0-model for M if for every point P ∈ M, there exists an isomorphism ΦP: TPM → V so that

The scaling function ψ(z) and scaling variable z are expressed via the experimental quantities, the invariant inclusive cross section Ed3σ/dq3 and the multiplicity density of charged particles ρA(s, η). The physics interpretation the scaling function ψ as a probability density to produce a particle with the formation length z is argued. The quantity z has the property of the fractal measure and δ is the fractal dimension describing the intrinsic structure of the interaction constituents revealed at high energies. The fractal dimensions of nucleon δN, pion δπ and nuclei δA were found. They satisfy the relation δπ < δN < <δA.

In practice, we do this by picking the M configurations with the lowest predicted execution times. We then measure the actual execution times of these configurations, and find the best among them. Again, this is not guaranteed to be the globally best configuration since the model may be so inaccurate that the globally optimal configuration is not included among the M configurations in the second stage. Sometimes these M configurations also include invalid configurations. This is, however, not a big problem if the models are trained with enough data.

Now assume that a is not the source of any maximal path. Let y be the longest path with source a. Then EP(a) = E(socP(a)) = E(S(t(y))) = I(t(y)). The lemma follows if we show that t(y) is the target of some maximal path. Since the path y is not maximal, there exists the smallest predecessor c of a such that the path z from c to t(y) is maximal. Thus t(z) = t(y) and hence I(t(y)) = I(t(z)) is projective.

In the Quantum Theory a probability density equals to the quadrate of the state vector module. A fermion state vector is the 4-component complex vector. Hence, a fermion state vector has got 8 real components. Therefore, some conformity between such vectors and the octaves (the Cayley numbers) can be determined.

Therefore, we can only remove 3 of the 6 phases present in the unitary matrix UMNS by redefing the charged lepton fields. Note that UMNS is the product of an unitary matrix, analogous to the CKM matrix which has one phase (the so-called universal phase), δl, and a diagonal phase matrix which contains two phases (the so-called Majorana phases), α21 and α31. The leptonic analog of the Jarlskog invariant, which measures the CP violation due to the universal phase, is given by

In the early years of networking we were happy when we could get electronic copies of astronomical catalogues without the delays through shipments of tapes. Now we are so flooded with them that in the rush of using many of them at the same time we sometimes forget that each one of them is telling us a different story. We must still read their detailed documentation if we want to derive reliable results from the available data. We have gone a good part of the way already to the point where all past issues of the major astronomical journals will be available electronically on the web. However, network saturation still keeps us from skimming a journal in the way that we could in the library.

In order to constrain the Mg II fits as much as possible, the 2 Mg II lines were fitted simultaneously with both lines forced to have the same column density (N), Doppler parameter (b), and central velocity (v). We were concerned about the possibility that much of the residual flux present below the Mg II absorption lines may be scattered light. Unfortunately, there is currently no scattered light correction for E230H data like there is for E140H spectra (see above). We tried fits with much of the possible scattered light flux subtracted from the spectrum to see the degree to which the fit parameters were affected. The uncertainties quoted in Table 1 include the systematic uncertainties we estimate due to the uncertain scattered light correction.
For the fepv cluster, we enforce mirror symmetry through the center of the cluster perpendicular to thec crystallographic axes, giving the cluster point symmetry Cs. For the low-spin fep cluster we retain the Th symmetry group; this is relaxed in the high-spin cluster which was run with no symmetry constraints to accomodate possible Jahn-Teller distortions. The positions of the central iron atom, its coordinating oxygen atoms, and the magnesium and silicon atoms attached to the coordinating oxygen atoms are optimized within the rigid outer shell of the cluster (oxygen atoms and link atoms). Relaxed bond lengths in the primary coordination sphere of the iron for all clusters are given in Table 1.
For a neutralino heavier than the W-boson, the situation is different. Among many channels with weak gauge bosons and Higgses in the final states, there are those where the s-wave is not suppressed at all and those where it is strictly forbidden. Thus the average suppression is not strong.

The OSIRIS instrument is not only powerful scientifically but also quite modest in cost and complexity. It draws upon much of the experience of previous Keck instruments especially NIRSPEC (McLean et al, 1998). Due to a simpler detector readout, it actually has simpler electronics requirements than the NIRSPEC instrument allowing us to essentially clone most of the vital electronics. Because of the expected low backgrounds and long exposures, the detector can be clocked out relatively slowly, about 1 hertz per frame, meaning that we only need to use a four channel readout scheme. We also anticipate only two or perhaps three cryogenic mechanisms of fairly simple design.
There are two equivalent ways of stating this criterion: one involves the Laplacian of a radial function based on the metric and one involves the difference of curvature-type quantities which are defined next and will play a substantial role in subsequent considerations.

The ever increasing distribution of smartphones creates new networking possibilities. Equipped with several network interfaces the mobiles can form spontaneous ad hoc networks (e.g., to bypass bad links). Connecting to another device as sender, receiver, or relay for data packets, always requires trust towards the peer, as reciprocal dependencies arise concerning data privacy, service availability, and incentives for investing energy. Determining the trustworthiness of nearby devices is an important but also challenging requirement for ad hoc communication as central instances or pre-shared secrets are not feasible.

By developing this new pipeline, we can generate image mosaics using newly-obtained data, which will enable a more complete sky coverage for a given source catalog or the construction of potentially higher resolution images or images in other wavelengths. In addition, the pipeline simplifies the extension of this work to either user-defined catalogs or to other published catalogs, such as the Messier Catalog or the New General Catalog. Furthermore, a specific scientific inquiry may require the construction of a user-defined catalog by imposing selection criteria to study certain types of objects. To accomplish this task, a user simply needs to generate a text file containing source positions, source radii, and unique identifier for each source, which can subsequently be used as input to the pipeline.

Second, the remnant weak field had a long-lasting effect that remained after each region had decayed away. Decaying regions that produced coronal holes tended to leave large-scale patches of unipolar weak field which took several rotations to disperse after the region itself had decayed away. These remnant fields were much weaker than the original active-region fields but they were spread over a much larger area. The weak remnant fields had low-order multipole moments of comparable strength to those of the original active regions, and thereby approximately preserved the global field signature of the active region long after the region itself has decayed away. This is why the global coronal field structure remained almost unchanged during the process of coronal hole formation.

In fig 7. we present the plots of the total energy corresponding to the cases of d = 6 and d = 10. We see a slow change of energy (when kink and antikink approach each other) followed by a rapid annihilation. We have looked at many other cases - but they produced qualitatively the same results (varying, of course, in the time required for the original approach). Hence, we feel that the n = 4 model is unlikely to possess breather like solutions.

The agreement between the numerical simulations and the observational data is very remarkable (see Fig. 2 for the agreement in positions). Only a little disagreement in positions between these results and the Majewski et al. stream exists in the less populated region of the stream. This region also corresponds to the oldest part of the stream (it has been unbound more than 4 Gyrs ago). One reason of the disagreement could be that the MW potential has evolved during the last 4 Gyrs and, therefore, the cosmological evolution of the MW should be considered in order to obtain realistic old tidal streams. Another reason could be the uncertainty on the observational proper motions of Sgr, since a small variation of the proper motions of the satellite center produces large differences in the positions of the stream at large distances of the Sgr main body. Obviously, another reason could be the necessity of improving the MW model.

There is no harm in replacing Λ(n) (which restricts the sum to prime powers) with λ(n) (which restricts the sum to primes), as the difference between these two sums is O(N1/2), which can easily be absorbed by the error terms. In fact, for our purposes it is better to restrict to prime sums as this way we know that the representation will be as a sum of two primes and not potentially a prime power.

We propose the following interpretation for the presence or absence of a precursor: it is necessary to have λ ≪ 1 in order to suppress a too strong thermal gamma-ray emission from the photosphere. This naturally leads to a prompt thermal X-ray activity, which then could be very frequent in GRBs. However this activity is too weak to be easily detected when it occurs simultaneously to the bright non-thermal emission from the internal shocks. It is only when it appears as a precursor activity that it can be clearly identified. This can happen if by chance the relativistic wind is initially produced with a smooth distribution so that the internal shock activity is delayed. The expected features of such precursors are very close to the properties of the X-ray precursors observed by GINGA and WATCH/GRANAT.

In the case of Zn granules, where the diffusion time is longer, there is a difference in the shape of the calculated distributions for recoil energies in the ranges 5-15keV and 40-60keV. At low recoil energies the theoretical distribution is shifted toward longer times in agreement with the measurements. In Sn, the quasiparticle relaxation times are shorter and both the calculated and measured time delay distributions are within 200 ns.

Some non-thermal processes will cause a deviation from the equilibrium ionization balance. This can be electron or ion beams where the velocity is non-Maxwellian, e.g. after a magnetic reconnection where particles are magnetically accelerated or a change in the high-energy tail of the distribution caused by Fermi-acceleration in shock fronts. Calculations of this kind require accurate knowledge of the collisional ionization and recombination (radiative, dielectronic, 2-photon) rates. Bryans et al. (2006) compare calculations and laboratory work and present revised ionization equilibria with differ up to 60% from previous works for the peak fractional abundance. The tails of the fractional abundances for energies away from the peak formation require larger adjustments. Unfortunately, non-equilibrium effects are seen particularly by the formation of lines at temperatures away from the peak formation temperature. Additionally, it takes some time until Coulomb collisions equilibrate the temperatures of electrons and ions separately and later between electron and ions. After rapid heating and cooling processes, e.g. after passing of a shock wave, the gas might not be in ionization equilibrium and the measured temperature thus does not reflect the kinetic state of the plasma.
Introduction
The standard internal-external shock model, which is built under many simplifications, has been proved to be well fitted by observations qualitatively but generally. Based on the success of this model, it should be very important to study the deviations from the standard model, which indicate that the simplifications should be relaxed in some aspects. Hence, the deviations contain important new information and have been a fruitful research area.

The main result is the characterization this functional as the least element in a partially ordered family of functionals having certain convex-geometric properties. This characterization does not involve taking a limit as the number of messages goes to infinity. The proof of this main result suggests an iterative algorithm for evaluating the infinite-message minimum sum-rate functional. We demonstrate this algorithm through an example of computing the minimum function of three sources.

Limits of our model lie in its simplifications: one dimensional treatment, linear elasticity and viscosity, isotropy and homogeneity of material parameters including friction, identical properties of all cells contained in the severed region. However, the agreement between model and experiment is already good, and validates these approximations a posteriori. We emphasize that one major goal of this model is to provide an order of magnitude of the friction to viscosity ratio ξ. We do not claim that this model is unique, nor that it is general. In the future we hope to further test the model ingredients and relevance on this epithelium and other quasi-planar ones.

To discuss the kinetics of the system, it is assumed that the elementary reactions are the flippings of one spin at a time. In reality, perhaps the simultaneous flipping of two or more spins is possible, but in those cases it is more troublesome to construct the model phenomenologically. In this work, especially, the principle of detailed balance is used to regulate the relative magnitudes of the transition rates. Given the equilibrium fraction of native and denatured SUs, the ratio of forward and backward single-SU-flipping rate constants can be determined. If it is desired to include double-SU-flipping processes, the ratio of forward and backward double-SU-flipping rate constants have to be determined. It will be seen later that in the present work the focus is on the quasi-chemical approximation in which the ratio between number of neighboring SU-pair in difference configurations are derived. However, this is still not enough because double-SU-flipping processes are not limited to happening to nearest-neighboring SU-pairs. Presently, there does not seem to have a good principle for setting up detail-balanced double-SU-flipping model. Therefore, to avoid unwanted mistakes, those high-order processes are not considered. Also noted is that, for brevity, in this paragraph flip or flipping were used to describe the forward and backward transitions between the native and denatured states of one SU. These terms will be used throughout the text whenever there is no need to worry about ambiguity.
On the previous step we got a sequence of split exact sequences (with obvious notation):

The N-qubit Kochen-Specker theorem rules out theories for which each qubit must always be assigned independent truth values, which is to say, theories that deny the possibility of entanglement. A critical NKS set cannot also be a complete KS set, and so alone it does not rule out the existence of noncontextual hidden variable theories that allow entanglement. The usual Kochen-Specker theorem then rules out even these entanglement-friendly noncontextual hidden variable theories, but the critical KS set always requires additional IDs (i.e. additional measurement contexts).

As the application executes, it is monitored using the generated probes, which update a conceptually centralized (but physically distributed) model of the current configuration. This model is periodically compared to the desired state description. If it is detected that the model has ceased to satisfy the constraints specified in the DSD, the DSD is evolved to take account of the currently available hardware and software resources, and the solving cycle is repeated. This may occur as a result of failures of components or hosts within the deployment. Evolution may also be initiated by a human administrator, allowing components in the distributed application to be upgraded, or new components to be introduced.
Introduction
Table 4 summarizes the result of fitting the various Iron line models to the BeppoSAX data set. As reported by Guainazzi et al. (1999) the standard disk model fits the data well. Like the ASCA results the inclination angle is well constrained to be i ≈ 35o and constraining i = 10o requires an additional Gaussian line (Table 4: column 2 and 3). The double zone model also fits the data well but the inner line producing region is somewhat smaller than the ASCA results (Ro1 ≈ 6.2rg).

Finally a general figure of merit efficiency parameter was calculated for the finite length Halbach cylinder as a function of the length of the cylinder. The dimensions of the most efficient Halbach cylinder were shown to only slowly approach the values for the case of a cylinder of infinite length as the length of the cylinder is increased.

Introduction
Using 3 1/2 solar cycles of NSO/KP and WSO photospheric synoptic data and extrapolated coronal potential field models, we characterized the cyclical evolution of the global photospheric and coronal magnetic fields. The global coronal morphology follows the progress of the magnetic activity cycle, taking a simple dipole-like form during each activity minimum and evolving through series of complex configurations with more structure of smaller active-region scales at the height of each activity maximum. At all phases of the cycle except times of polar field reversal the large-scale, low-order fields, particularly the axisymmetric dipole and octupole, generally dominate the global coronal morphology. The higher-order multipole components of the coronal field, corresponding to the smaller spatial scales, are strongly correlated with the sunspot/active region cycle, as are the non-axisymmetric components of the coronal field. Only the axisymmetric dipole and octupole components correlate well with the polar fields but since these components are generally the largest contributors to the global field, except when the polar field reverses, the polar fields play a determinative role in structuring the global corona. There is no significant signature of polar field reversal in the non-axisymmetric multipoles. The apparent dipole tilt observed over the solar cycle is almost entirely due to the active-region fields.
It should be noted that this definition of biological function is not circular, although it has itself as part of its definition; rather it is recursive; a chimp hand and a human hand can have the same function because of each other. It does require that a structure must have a homolog for it to have a function. It does not require that these homologous structures be extant.

In Figure 1 we report the position of the sources in the HR1-HR2 plane for identified Type 1 and Type 2 AGN and for the complete ASCA HSS sample, along with the loci expected from a single absorbed power-law model, with energy index and absorbing column density as indicated in the figures (see Della Ceca et al., 1999b for details).
Then Q is a wqo.
Introduction
For simplicity, we will, from now on, stick to the purely ferromagnetic regime. If the chain were periodic, the zeros would be distributed homogeneously on the unit circle (they can be calculated analytically). In the thermodynamic limit, they fill the circle densely except near the point (1, 0) on the real axis, where we are left with a gap since we do not have a phase transition at finite temperature (i.e., for 0 < T < ∞). One might perhaps expect the very same situation in the Fibonacci case, but the latter is always good for a surprise.

where c > 0 is a universal constant.
For small distances between two probability distributions, it is expected that the minimum sample size required to discriminate them be large. Otherwise, a small or moderate sample size is sufficient to discriminate the models. We assume that the user will specify beforehand the PCS and the tolerance level in terms of the distance between the beta and Kumaraswamy distributions. When a tolerance level is specified (by means of some distance), the two distribution functions are not considered to be significantly different if their distance does not exceed the tolerance level. PCS and tolerance level play a similar role that the power and Type-I error in the corresponding testing of hypotheses problem.

From the above it can be seen that there is no unique definition for cognitive radio and depending on the focus (e.g. users requirements versus system requirements) and applications different definitions can be put forward. The two main characteristics that come forward in most definitions, however, are reconfigurablity and intelligent adaptive behaviour.

In May 2012 the members of the SKA Organisation announced the outcome of the site selection process. They decided on a dual-site implementation to maximise the value of the investments made on both sites and to maintain an inclusive approach to the SKA. The agreement means that in Phase 1 Australia will host the low frequency aperture arrays (SKA1-Low, see Figure 1) and a survey instrument that incorporates the 36 ASKAP dishes and approximately 60 additional dishes with phased array feeds (SKA1-Survey). In Phase 1 South Africa the SKA will incorporate the 64 dish MeerKAT with about another 190 dishes equipped with sensitive single pixel feeds into a sensitive instrument called SKA1-Mid. All 3 telescopes will operate independently as part of a single SKA Observatory. In Phase 2 the dish array (Figure 1) in South Africa will be built out further, totalling about 3000 dishes and including stations in the partner African countries, delivering baselines as long as 3000 km. The low frequency aperture array will be expanded in Australia to the full SKA collecting area. In Phase 2 the dense, or mid-frequency, aperture array (Figure 1) will be built in South Africa, pending successful review of this technology as part of the SKA Advanced Instrumentation Programme (AIP).
In this section we will show that the phase transition does not occur for the p-adic Ising model.

Attempts at making ion trap arrays where the Coulomb interaction between ions is strong enough, while at the same time keeping the ions cold and maintaining a deep trap are often stymied by the physics of 2D trap arrays. There are three characteristics which need to be optimized in a 2D array of ion traps intended for quantum experiments:
Naming a Channel with Beeps
To help design future ground-based or space telescopes aiming at characterizing the environment on terrestrial exoplanets, or to address scientific questions like the probability of habitable worlds in the galaxy, one has to make assumptions on the possible climates and atmospheres that may exist on terrestrial exoplanets. For this, speculation is unavoidable because no direct observations of terrestrial atmospheres are available outside the solar system. The limited sample that we can observe here suggest that a wide diversity of planetary environment is possible. Would we imagine Venus or Titan if they were not there?
Specifically, Yn(θ) may be an eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator:

From the point of view of the system administration, the predictions may trigger different actions, such as collecting bikes from a station that is almost full before the users face the problem of not finding places to leave their bikes. Moreover, it is possible to extend these predictions with other datasets available online, like the neighborhood wealth, the proximity of a place to other public transportation, schools and companies. The extended version of the predictions may be used to decide whether it is a good option to install a new station at a certain place or not, based on how many users would use it during the year.
A graph G = (V, E) is vertex-transitive if for all u, v ∈ V, there exists an automorphism φ of G such that φ(u) = v. We will assume all of our graphs are infinite vertex-transitive graphs.
We have shown that there are two types of asymptotically Friedmann solutions with trivial and nontrivial asymptotic values for C. The first is asymptotically proper Friedmann and the second is asymptotically quasi-Friedmann. In this section we see their physical properties.

A digraph G is a super-tournament if either uv ∈ E(G) or vu ∈ E(G) for every distinct u, v ∈ V(G). In particular, a simple super-tournament is a semi-complete digraph. We give a counter-example to show that the class of all super-tournaments is not a wqo under minor containment; and indeed, the subclass of all super-tournaments with no three edges mutually parallel is not a wqo.
Rydberg states provide an ideal resource for non-linear optical media, with a diverse range of possible applications from electrometry to quantum information. The desired properties can be optimized by choice of principal quantum number and angular momentum state, or tuned by application of external electric or magnetic fields. These properties can be efficiently mapped onto strong optical transitions, allowing non-destructive read-out for classical applications like electrometry or large single photon non-linearities for quantum information applications.

The star formation process in molecular clouds shows us that most stars form in bound clusters. The dissolution of such clusters is inevitable over time, and stars are lost from these primordial groups into the field (talk by Lada). Thus, when we find young stars and brown dwarfs in the field, we should accept that the birth history for a significant fraction of them will be unrecoverable. In short, not every young star that you find should belong to a moving group.

Spiking Analog VLSI Neuron Assemblies as Constraint Satisfaction Problem Solvers
WIMPs may be captured, thermalized, and trapped using a combination of scattering in the core and in the crust. When a WIMP first nears a neutron star, gravity accelerates it to a high energy. These energetic WIMPs can scatter efficiently in the core because nucleon Pauli blocking plays less of a role. The energetic WIMP can easily excite nucleons above the Fermi sea so σWn ≈ σ0. However, energetic WIMPs can scatter at large q where the nuclear form factor F(q) ≪ 1. Therefore scattering in the crust may be inefficient for high energy WIMPs. Over time the WIMPs can loose energy by repeatedly scattering from nucleons in the core until the WIMPs have much lower energy. At that point Pauli blocking is important so scattering in the core becomes inefficient σWn ≪ σ0. However low energy WIMPs can now scatter efficiently in the crust.
Further, for a spanning subgraph H(X) of G = (V, E, L), we have the following Corollary.

Therefore, moGrams is a powerful visualization technique, which aids in the understanding of the problem and the similarities between the solutions. Additionally, groups of solutions or the most flexible ones are easily detected thanks to this network-based visualization.

To be viable, a new cosmological model must at least describe the observations that are consistent with the currently popular standard model; be simpler or consistent with more types of observations; describe additional observations poorly or unsatisfactorily explained by the current model; and make predictions that differ from the current model and that are later confirmed. A definite advantage for any new physics model would be if the link between the big (cosmology) and small (subatomic) were part of the model. If the Hubble Law and z do not reflect universe expansion, then the SPM has yet to confront the nucleosynthesis pillar and the CMB pillar of the standard model. The SPM may include the nucleosynthesis of atoms and subatomic particles from the Source outward rather than from the evolution of the universe from the initial state. Further, the SPM should develop a galaxy evolution model.
Discussion
Thus we find
Since every blade represents an oriented subspace and blades are easy to compute with, they are a natural candidate for subspace computations. The extra scalar degree of freedom allows the future potential for more precise calculations with subspaces that attach meaning to the magnitude of a blade. Therefore in this paper four blade operations are introduced to correspond to the four subspace operations. The blade operations are made first for Euclidean space because the relationship between blades and projection operators is strongest in Euclidean space. Therefore first a correspondence is made from projection operators to blades, then the four blade operations are defined and shown to faithfully mirror the subspace operations.

The first property corresponds to fixed points where none of the hosts are present. The second property corresponds to fixed points where hosts with low defense level are not present (i.e. hosts that can be infected by all or many viral types are not present). The third one corresponds to fixed points where hosts of high defense are not present (i.e. hosts that can be infected by one or only a few viral types are not present). The last property corresponds to fixed points where host of intermediate defense level are not present.
The policy evaluation problem consists in finding a function that satisfies the most this system (which may include several trajectories). This can be achieved in several ways. In the following, all major methods are described in a single and simple framework:
Still worse is the fact that QED is known to have problems in its theoretical structure: the most well-known and important is that (for the energy shifts and the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons) calculations are done by using a cut-off that is not intrinsic to QED, therefore suggesting that the theory would have to fail beyond a certain energy scale; also (in the case of the anomalies for the magnetic moment of leptons) calculations are based on perturbative expansions which, despite being finite term-by-term, do not converge in the entire series.

The two-slit and related experiments demonstrate a striking feature of quantum mechanics: for any two alternatives that cannot be distinguished by a measurement scheme, their joint probability is obtained by summing their contributions at the level of probability amplitudes; therefore interference terms appear. If, however, a macroscopic distinction of these alternatives is possible, the interference terms are suppressed and the joint probability is the sum of the individual probabilities.

Random Substitution-Insertion-Deletion (RSID) Model of Molecular Evolution with Alignment-free Parameter Estimation
We have taken an important step towards finding realistic models for a chiral spin liquid in a frustrated spin system. We believe that this will nucleate new research efforts both by theorists and experimentalists. From a theoretical point of view, studying the transition from the chiral spin liquid to the putative time-reversal symmetric spin liquid in the Heisenberg model will provide the unique opportunity to study a topological phase transition in a realistic model, and may provide invaluable insights into the physics of frustrated spins on the Kagome lattice. For experimentalists, our work will provide a guide in searching for realizations of bosonic fractional Quantum Hall physics in the lab, be it in materials that have Kagome lattice structure and form Mott insulators, or by engineering such systems in cold atomic gases.

The main idea of joint deep learning is to include feature extraction, part deformation handling, occlusion handling and classification in one single deep neural network where two layers of convolutional layers exist.

And the second convolutional layer is responsible for deformation handling to extract a score based on different visible parts of an object.

Interpreting SVM as a metric learning problem allows us to fully equip it with the metric learning primal bias, i.e to maximize some between-class distance measure and minimize some within-class distance measure. We propose a learning framework in which in addition to the standard SVM margin maximization, we also minimize some measure of the within-class distance. We will call the resulting learning algorithms metric-learning-based SVM. In the next sections we will give different general functions of the within and between class distances which can be the target of optimization. We will then propose SVM specific within-class distance measures, and finally formulated the full learning problem which now will also include some measure of the within class distance.

We perform Monte Carlo simulations of a four-dimensional gauge invariant spin system which describes random surfaces with gonihedric action. We develop the analogy between the flat-crumpled phase transition of the lattice surface model and the liquid-gas phase transition of non-ideal gases, and identify the self-intersection coupling constant k of the surface model with the pressure P. As k increases the system moves to a critical point in complete analogy with the situation for non-ideal gases, where the liquid and the gas phases approach each other with increasing P. We measure vacuum expectation values of various operators and the corresponding critical indices.

In the present work we study the mechanisms through which scale invariant noise is generated, as the complexity of the system is modified. The SOC hypothesis is only applicable to situations which cannot be described by simple, deterministic laws. When the behavior of the system is very predictable, it will show only certain kinds of catastrophes, and not a power law spectrum, as predicted by the SOC hypothesis.
Taking the arccotangent form for the phase shift to one loop allows the result to be in the full range of 0 to 180 degrees. It was argued above that the imaginary part will be too small since only the first term of the perturbation series is present to one loop. This would result in a lower phase shift than the full result of the theory should give. Indeed this turns out to be the case as seen by the dashed line in figures 4, 5, and 6. This is especially apparent for δ11 which shows no sign of a ρ resonance from this analysis for either the master formula or χPT since it is impossible to see resonances from a strict perturbative expansion due to violation of unitarity.
Altogether, we obtain that the transition amplitude between two states with good particle number can be approximated by

The frontier of discovery in nuclear physics aims to explain the nature of nuclei which is an essential component in energy, medical, and biological research, and national security. Nuclear physicists are working toward a unified description of nuclei to transform current models into predictive capability; in particular, allowing reliable extrapolations into regions and regimes that are not accessible by experiments. Ultimately, this would allow for accurate predictions of nuclear reactions, with significant impact towards the development of advanced fission reactors and fusion energy sources, and in industrial and medical innovations via use of stable isotopes and radioisotopes.

To compare their performance, all of these features were evaluated on all FHR time series in the dataset. Some algorithms could not be applied appropriately to some time series, e.g., fitting a positive-only distribution to time series that are not positive-only. In cases such as these, algorithms returned a special value: an infinity or a NaN. Features for which this occurred at least once across the dataset were removed from our analysis, and in this way, the initial set of 9 613 features was reduced to approximately 7 600 features.

A general rule is that the closer the phase calibrator is to the target source, the higher quality the images made with phase referencing. The strength of the calibrator is secondary as long as it can be detected. In other words, a source which is just barely detected (say 3-sigma for a solution) will produce a phase error of about 10 degrees which will be stochastic since it is determined from random noise processes. In contrast, the use of a very strong calibrator, further away from the target, to obtain phase solutions will have virtually no phase error component caused by noise, but systematic phase errors of tens of degrees may persist over many solution intervals and limit the dynamic range of the resulting images of the target source. Thus, the use of in-beam calibrators which are weak generally provides better astrometric accuracy and image fidelity. These in-beam calibrators also provide simultaneous calibration of the target source, whereas nodding calibrator phases must be interpolated and then interpolated to apply to the target source.
The outgroup-directed allele frequency as used in the data analysis is now simply a sum over the two cases in which the single outgroup-sample carries either of the two alleles:

Table 1 lists the average search time (ms) per query taken by various indexing structures. It can be observed that MTB tree takes comparatively lesser time. Bag distance computation helps in reducing the time complexity.
However, in this energy region, the low energy approximation is not well satisfied even though, we believe, the order of magnitude estimation must be correct. Unfortunately, there is no such high energy laser available at present.

where B15 = B/1015 G, M is the nucleon mass and we express the mass (A) and atomic (Z) number of the ions in terms of A66 = A/66 and Z28 = Z/28 (chosen because 66Ni28 is one of the favored isotopes at these densities).

Polarimetric data were analysed for the presence of periodic variations related to the dynamics of the binary system.
However, the observed flux variations have an amplitude approximately 2 to 6 times larger than that of our model. It is likely that there are spots on the stellar surface that are never transited by the planet, therefore this model does not account for them. Such spots could contribute to the deeper minima in the observations, explaining the amplitude discrepancy.

Often other professors are suspicious of the professor who does take an interest in education.

In our current work, we have not addressed the burial problem directly, as we have limited ourselves to accretion mounds strictly confined within the polar cap with a fixed boundary far from the surface. Such a situation is more applicable to HMXB or young LMXB systems where higher field strengths and lower accretion rates result in mounds of smaller mass and size. If such a neutron star is to evolve into a low-field object by field burial, the process should commence at this early stage itself. However, our current work hints that pressure driven instabilities, which have so far been ignored, may play an important role in limiting the efficacy of the burial process.

Introduction
Taking into account a small size of T7 RNA polymerase, this sequence is sufficiently large to be the only region involved in the formation of specific contacts with the enzyme thus indicating the importance of this area for RNA polymerase-promoter recognition in this case. The promoters have been earlier characterized by their complex formation with RNA polymerase and transcription initiation (McAllister & Carter, 1980; McAllister, Morris, Rosenberg, & Studier, 1981; McAllister & Wu, 1978). Despite their considerable sequence similarity, the promoters of II and III classes essentially differ by their strengths and by some biochemical properties (Golomb & Chamberlin, 1974; Kassavetis & Chamberlin, 1979; McAllister & Carter, 1980; McAllister et al., 1981; McAllister & Wu, 1978; McAllister & McCarron, 1977; Niles & Condit, 1975; Studier & Rosenberg, 1981), thus suggesting some contribution of physical properties in their functional behaviour.

Let us also remark that the eigenvalue of the function f is equal to the squared distance between (0, 0) and ν(f). This observation completes the proof.
A primary challenges in employing an algorithm for the maximum network flow problem to Delta is in (a) knowing the sequence of events in advance, and (b) extending it a limited size cache. The computation of the max-cover (or equivalently determining the max flow) changes as different knowledge of the future becomes available. In the example, if we just did not know what would happen at time 8s, but knew everything before, we would not load o4, and instead ship q3 and q7. Then when q8 arrives, we would ship it too. Thus, different partial knowledge of the future can lead to very different decisions and costs. The decisions obtained by the computation of the max-cover applies only to the objects in cache. We still need a mechanism for profitably loading objects in the cache.

where the numerical coefficient slightly depends on scale (T/S is calculated here for 10o angular scale). Eq.(1) allows to replace one parameter (T/S) by another (nT). It is interesting to note that in power-law inflation there exists an additional relation between n and nT, so in this model T/S can be expressed in terms of n. However, generally such relation is absent (see, e.g., Lukash et al. (2000), Lukash and Mikheeva (2000)). Thus, instead of considering additional constraints related with given inflationary model, we prefer to consider n and T/S as independent variables within their ranges.
We need also the following more precise result:
It should be said further if above considerations are correct then it follows that an independent natural full invariant of an abstract group is needed to exist. An investigation of invariants of described symmetrical objects generated by these groups gives the way for obtaining this full invariant.
Discussion and future works
After irradiation, cells were harvested from the surface of culture flasks by trypsinization, resuspended in complete medium and then pelleted by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1800 rpm. The cells were washed twice in cold PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in NIM-DAPI (Beckman Coulter, USA) and were stained overnight at 4o C. For every control and treated sample, 20.000 cells were measured on Beckman Coulter Cell Lab Quanta SC flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA), using mercury arc lamp 100 W, a 355/37 exciter and a 460 BP filter for the collection of fluorescence and linear amplification. After gating and elimination of the debris, all flow cyotmetric data were collected as LMD files and analyzed using Flowing Software (developed by Cell Imaging Core, Turku Centre for Biotechnology, Abo Akademi University Finland).

We have developed an imaging approach based on the concepts of CS theory which, on samples relevant for biological imaging, allows the reconstruction of fluorescence images with undersampling ratios up to 64. While our results constitute a significant gain over undersampling ratios achieved in prior CS-based imaging approaches, several factors (computational, instrumental, or noise-related) still contribute to limit the current performances of CFM. We finally discuss strategies to further reduce the number of acquisition by taking into account the sample sparsity, not only in the spatial but also in the spectral domain.
Concluding Remarks
Application to the brane cosmology
The preliminary design, resulting from a two year engineering study by Makai Ocean Engineering, specifies the detector to be a right cylindrical shape, transported in a special barge from which it may be deployed, and recovered. The inner volume of liquid scintillator is separated from the photodetectors by a segmented acrylic layer. The individual optical units are in clusters, in plain oil. Outside this stainless steel vessel will be a further layer of 2 meters of pure water, and veto photomultipliers (as well this layer provides access to the inner tank for installation and repairs). Very importantly in this design, all fiber-optic and electrical connections will be made pierside, tested and calibrated prior to deployment (avoiding previous bad experience with unreliable connectors in the ocean, and difficult remote connections via robot). The detector design is aimed at multiple deployments on a roughly annual cycle, allowing changes of venue to follow the science.

To conclude, we have shown that Sudakov suppression of the cross section of leptoproduction of vector mesons is quite strong if the term (3) is still prevailing for small size dipoles (7). The general effect of Sudakov form factors is further suppression of large size colour dipoles and of unequal sharing of energy among its components apart from effects due to the wave functions.

Oscillatory primordial features are clearly not only imprinted in the temperature fluctuations (T) but should also be visible in the polarisation of the CMB, in particular the E-mode fluctuations (E). Both the fluctuations in temperature and polarisation originate from the same primordial fluctuations and are simply convolved with different transfer functions to obtain the observed CMB anisotropies. Thus any model that exhibits a TT power spectrum modulation necessarily also produces a modulation in the EE power spectrum and the TE cross-spectrum. In this sense polarisation is a more stringent test for oscillatory features and there is no need to include additional tunable parameters like a relative amplitude R discussed above in a combined temperature and polarisation search.

where R and Q are arbitrary polynomials of the indicated degrees. The first choice will add a brane to the U(5)-stack, turning it into a U(6)-stack, which we do not want. The second choice is the one that was made in the previous model. However, we can combine both of these choices and complete the square as follows:
In what follows I briefly review these subjects. In section 2 nonequilibrium corrections to the spectra of normal massless neutrinos and their possible observational manifestations are discussed. In section 3 the role of a possibly heavy ντ in nucleosynthesis is considered and an upper bound on its mass is presented. Neutrino degeneracy and especially a possible variation of the latter on the cosmological scales (a few 100 Mpc or even Gpc) is discussed in section 4. In section 5 neutrino oscillations are considered. In Conclusion the main results of this brief review is summarized.

If a non-rotating cluster has one or more subgroups with a significant velocity difference with respect to the rest of the cluster then, in the rotation diagram, we may observe peaks (or troughs) at some angle θ but not a significant periodicity. However, there are cases where global rotation and infalling substructures cannot be easily distinguished: (a) a subgroup occupying a relatively large fraction of the cluster projected area; (b) two significant subgroups of galaxies moving at opposite directions within the cluster potential, although such a case requires fine tunning and thus should be rare. In general, the expectations for a non-rotating cluster, with no significant infalling substructures, is expected to have a random rotation diagram (no systematic dependence of vdif(θ) on θ) with relatively small values of vdif(θ).
where the subscripts λ̂V and λ̂Z denote the optimal regularization parameter according to the source validation and the target risk, respectively. Studying these two forms, we see that these estimates of λ differ mainly through their data inner products (i.e., the uncentered, unnormalized covariance matrices). To illustrate this point, we can decompose the data through a singular value decomposition, allowing us to express the minimizers as:
Model fits to simulated long-term (3-year) data

We address the problem of inferring the structure of unobserved social networks in a much more ambitious setting. We consider a diffusion process where a contagion (e.g., disease, information, product adoption) spreads over the edges of the network, and all that we observe are the infection times of nodes, but not who infected whom i.e. we do not observe the edges over which the contagion spread. The goal then is to reconstruct the underlying social network along the edges of which the contagion diffused.

This work presents the results of our analysis carried out on two different large datasets representing the friendship structure of the well-known Facebook online social network. In particular, we here provide with some clues in the direction of verifying the renowned theory about (off-line) social networks and to propose a new perspective which, in our opinion, best captures the original intuition underlying so-called weak ties and their role in complex social networks.
In these experiments, we present several novel observations about the error surfaces of neural networks. We showed that paths through weight space are highly nonlinear, and that local minima (albeit good ones) are abundant. Further, we showed that even after symmetry is broken by random initialization, the error surfaces of neural networks appears to be highly non-convex. The stochasticity introduced by reshuffling data appears to be enough to diverge otherwise identical (and partially trained) networks towards different local minima. Further, we showed that regions of weight space with near 0 loss are not critical points, but large flat basins through which weights continue to travel as training continues.

We have also used both datasets to test the FLDA classifier with 3-fold cross-validation. As expected, due to the curse-of-dimensionality, the classification results were very poor.

These results clearly indicate that regularization improves classification performance.

This paper examined the pathwise accuracy of Metropolized integrators applied to overdamped and inertial Langevin dynamics. The paper primarily analyzed explicit discretizations of these ergodic SDEs. For explicit discretizations if the drift is nonglobally Lipschitz, discretization errors often lead to stochastically unstable Markov chains. A Metropolis-Hastings method was shown to stochastically stabilize these discretizations. The paper used this stochastic stability to quantify the error induced by the Metropolis-Hastings methods in approximating the solution to the SDE.

The present formula collection is kept at a comfortable size by limiting the sum of polynomial degrees in the algebraic integrands at four; to just include, in the notation of the Abstract, the degree-five product P1 m Q4 n in the same way would roughly double the size already. Among the degree-four integrands, no combination is omitted but P1 m Q3 n, as it could aid a systematic handling of elliptic integrals (for integer m and odd integer 2n) alongside its cousin P1 m Q4 n only. The combined degree of powers that accompany an exponential (or trigonometric) factor of linear argument is even limited at two: the degree-three products E1 P3 n , E1 P1 m Q2 n , and E1 P1 m Q1 n S1 p already appear to be of no interest in practice, and their integrals do not relate to one of the established hypergeometric functions either. Exponential factors with higher-degree arguments are ignored for the same reason.

SafeWare-funded researchers will attempt to construct obfuscated programs which are provably secure, i.e. programs whose de-obfuscation would involve the solution of a problem which is known, or generally believed, to be computationally infeasible. Currently, the only plausible candidates for such constructions are what we would call functional obfuscators, as opposed to control-flow obfuscators, data obfuscators, system-call obfuscators, communication obfuscators, or semantic obfuscators (in which portions of the program are expressed in a programming language that is initially unknown to the adversary).

This suggests that the fluxtube cutting mechanism is competitive as an r-mode saturation mechanism, being at least as efficient as mode-coupling.

If now the varying d problem can be transformed into a situation of fixed unit diameter d = 1, the discrepancy mentioned will not arise and application of the analytic solution of the OZ equation will be simpler. The price to pay is an interaction that varies with β in the transformed problem. As we will see below, this works out nicely and gives equations that can be given a direct physical interpretation.

As stated above, ΛCDM relies on the applicability of General Relativity on cosmological scales and on the use of the Cosmological Principle in order to make the calculations doable.

We are going to consider a narrow light beam that propagates in a spacetime with a slightly perturbed FRW metric.

The applicability of the method is limited by the angular resolution of the images, meaning that only large-scale PDRs can be used (about 50-500 parsec separation). To apply this same method to PDRs in our own Galaxy, we take a slightly different approach. Instead of considering an edge-on PDR, we look at the PDR face-on. Here, we consider a uniform radiation field impinging on a known molecular cloud along the line of sight (with the radiation coming either from the direction of the observer or from behind the cloud), and attempt to isolate the photodissociated atomic hydrogen in front and behind the molecular cloud. The linear dimension of the PDR model is therefore perpendicular to the plane of the sky, and we can consider each pixel on the observed map individually, as long as the approximation of the incident radiation going along the line of sight holds. In principle, we should now measure the HI column density in the proper direction, although the three dimensional structure of the cloud remains unknown.
Notice that Nasdaq during the 1985 - 2000 years did not fall off more than 6 weeks in raw in the weekly quotes and more than 4 month in raw in the monthly quotes. Last time Nasdaq was down 4 months in raw in the period September 2000 - December 2000. Using the results of Table 5, one could predict with certainty (with unit probability) a positive move of Nasdaq for January 2001. Such a prediction would be the correct one.

In the end, the data points using the same evolutionarily stable strategy are gathered together as a cluster, and the number of evolutionarily stable strategies indicates the number of clusters.

One might desire classical certification to ensure that the quantum protocol precisely replicates a known classical task. For example, a protocol for secure quantum multi-party computation which allows general quantum inputs clearly is not implementing precisely the same task as a protocol for secure classical multi-party computation, in which the inputs are, by definition, classical data. However, if the protocol had classical certification, the analogy would be precise.

Let {a, b, c, d} be the four vertices belonging to the boundary of face fK, encountered in this order clockwise around the boundary of the face. To maintain I2 we need to orient the edges of fK such that the origin and the destination of fK are two non-adjacent vertices, i.e., either a and c or b and d. In order to maintain I1, recall that the incoming edges of vK appear consecutive around it and so do the outgoing edges, unless vK is the source or the sink of the graph. Thus, if vK is neither the source nor the sink of the graph, then at most two of the reinserted vertices will have both incoming and outgoing edges incident to vK, whereas at most three will have only incoming or only outgoing edges incident to vK. We distinguish the following three cases.

Conclusions
However, other possible interpretations of the MACHO results have been proposed in order to avoid the difficulties associated with a large halo population of white dwarfs. The mass estimate for the lenses depends upon the assumed phase space distribution of MACHOs. There are large uncertainties in the halo model parameters, including the distribution and velocity structure of the dark matter, and attempts have been made to exploit these uncertainties in order to obtain mass estimates from the current data that are consistent with lenses in the substellar regime (e.g. brown dwarfs). Previous work by the authors and others have examined a wide range of halo models, including flattened halos, halos with a bulk rotational component to the velocity structure (Gyuk & Gates 1998) and halos with anisotropic velocity dispersions (Gyuk, Evans, & Gates 1998). These analyses have shown that for any reasonable (smoothly varying) phase space distribution of the lenses, the implied lens mass is still much larger than the hydrogen burning limit, and thus one cannot appeal to modeling uncertainties in order to invoke brown dwarfs as candidates for the MACHOs.

The above modeling work is based on a scene recognition task using 10 categories. In real life, however, there are a much larger number of scene categories. Beyond scenes, general object recognition and face recognition are the two most important recognition tasks that are performed regularly. The relative importance of central versus peripheral vision among the three categories needs to be examined carefully. Using a similar modeling approach, we describe our findings in large-scale scene, object, and face recognition in the sections below.

We have reformulated global and other constraints into answer set programs. In particular, we have investigated various generic ASP encodings for constraints on finite domains and proved which level of consistency unit-propagation achieves on them. Our techniques were formulated as preprocessing and can be applied to any ASP system without changing its source code, which allows for programmers to select the ASP solver that best fit their needs. We have empirically evaluated the performance of such an approach on benchmarks from CP and found that such reformulations outperform integrated ASP (CP) systems as well as pure CP solvers. Our future works includes the reformulation of other useful global constraints into answer set programming like the regular constraint, as well as global constraints like lex which are very useful for symmetry breaking.

Hence r will stay C and never move after time t.

Then s will turn C as well, and both robots will terminate correctly after seeing each other again.

The KC model is very much successful because it explanes well the synchrotron luminosity, spectrum and the size of the nebula.

It is paradoxical, but it took many years before the first paper appeared in which it was proven that it should be (not in a mathematical way, but in physical, by Yakov Zeldovich). If you have quantum mechanics, then there must be in the framework of general relativity a cosmological term due to virtual particles. In other words, due to zero state quantum oscillations.
We also note that there are classification theorems for other standard congruence subgroups such as Γ1(N) and Γ(N). In this paper we are mostly concerned with Γ0(N) as the other groups do not have elliptic points for N > 2.

We can now go a step forward, and explore the relation between physical laws, algorithms and their computability. As algorithms can be mapped to Turing machines, programs built with finite alphabets, they are infinitely many but numerables. The set of rational numbers is also infinite numerable, but the real numbers are non-numerable infinite. It follows that the absolute majority of irrational numbers are incomputable in principle: it is impossible to write a computer code to evaluate any of them. It is also impossible to name them, even trying to write a full encyclopedia devoted to each of them is worthless. This concept if thrilling for some of us. It invites to question the meaning of the physical theories, which associate physical observables with real numbers. But, has it any practical implication, or is just a curious but irrelevant information?

Heat conduction by phonons is a ubiquitous process that incorporates a wide range of physics and plays an essential role in applications ranging from space power generation to LED lighting. Heat conduction has been studied for over two hundred years, yet many microscopic aspects of heat conduction have remained unclear in most crystalline solids, including which phonons carry heat and how natural and artificial structures scatter specific phonons. Fortunately, recent advances in both computation and experiment are enabling an unprecedented microscopic view of thermal transport by phonons. In this topical review, we provide an overview of these methods, the insights they are providing, and their impact on the science and engineering of heat conduction.
During slow-roll inflation, which applies around horizon exit, the evolution of a scalar field approaches an attractor solution
We present a method for the production of segmented optics. It is a novel processing developed at INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera (INAF-OAB) employing commercial of-the-shelf materials. It is based on the shaping of thin glass foils by means of forced bending, this occurring at room temperature (cold-shaping). The glass is then assembled into a sandwich structure for retaining the imposed shape. The principal mechanical features of the mirrors are the very low weight, rigidity and environmental robustness. The cost and production time also turns to be very competitive. In this paper we sum up the results achieved during the r&d performed in the past years. We have investigated the theoretical limits of the structural components by means of parametric finite elements analyses; we also discuss the effects caused by the most common structural loads. Finally, the process implementation, the more significant validation tests and the mass production at the industry is described.
The normalizations in the last two equations, for which we have used values typical for the solar interior, assume that all quantities are expressed in cgs units. We have also introduced the reciprocal of the Roberts number ε = ηmag/K ≪ 1.

Figure 4 shows the properties of the gas in the vicinity of the explosion site within a 400 pc (comoving) slice of the cosmological volume, at 1 Myr, 10 Myr and 50 Myr after the explosion of the SMS. Comparing the radial velocity field (second column from the left) to the cosmological density field (far left column), it is clear that the blast wave propagates most rapidly into the low-density voids while its progress is halted in the direction of the high-density filaments, at the intersection of which lies the host halo. Figs. 2 and 4 also show the same general trend that, at late times, the most strongly shock-heated and highest-velocity material is located behind the shock front several kpc from the explosion site. The cooler material within the (≃ 1 kpc) virial radius of the host halo is able to begin recollapsing after 50 Myr. As we discuss next, this gas is likely to form second-generation stars that are enriched to fairly high metallicities.
Entanglement is widely considered to be the most counter-intuitive feature of quantum mechanics. In many introductions of entanglement, it is assumed that the non-local change of the wavefunction caused by a local measurement is an effect that has no classical explanation. However, such claims are rather misleading, since the same non-local change is caused by a classical (Bayesian) update of probabilities if the initial probability distribution (or prior) includes correlations between the two systems. In the following, I will show that this is indeed the correct analogy.

For ultrametric space X consider the set T(X), which contains all the of balls in X of nonzero diameter, and the balls of zero diameter which are maximal subbals in balls of nonzero diameter. On the set T(X) there is the natural partial order: I < J if for the corresponding balls I ⊂ J. Since for any two balls in an ultrametric space there exists the unique minimal ball, containing these two balls (which the supremum of the balls), the mentioned partial order will be a direction.
In order to find a good update order, we first introduce the concept of influence variance as

This is an interesting configuration in its own right. There has been several appearances of D3-branes at orbifold singularities in the literature, giving rise to interesting 3 + 1-dimensional gauge theories. In the present configuration, we find a gauge theory description of the 1 + 1-dimensional intersection. This theory is an ultraviolet description where gravity has been decoupled, which will flow to the relevant conformal field theory in the infrared. In this theory, we will be able to identify the states that are localized at the intersection, and which contribute the predominant amount of entropy. Since the configuration is perturbative, the analysis is reliable. Furthermore, we will be able to map these states to the string junctions of the previous section.

The standard eigenvalue-eigenvector method gives invalid answers if the matrix of coefficients is singular, precisely as seen here. The so-called Rouse modes, obtained by applying the standard eigenvalue-eigenvector method under circumstances such that the standard method is invalid, are not the actual modes of the Rouse model.
We use the notation in section two to state the main results in this article. Here some basic and special notations will be explained, which will be defined again in the next section.

WHI B1751-07 Although this looks like a spiral galaxy, there is detectable Hα in the same shape, so we identify it as a planetary nebula.
The amplitude is measured with respect to the baseline. Firstly, the average of 32 samples before the arrival of the pulse was used to estimate the baseline mean value, as well as the baseline RMS for each channel, defining the noise. The baseline mean value was subtracted from all samples, shifting the average baseline to zero. The amplitude is obtained as the maximum value of the signal.
A mask is used to mark or remove the zeroth order images. First the zeroth order sources in the grism image is matched to those in a broadband detection image. The sources are found with SExtractor (hereafter SE; Bertin & Arnouts, 1996) which is used to catalog the sources in both the detection and grism images. Only compact sources are matched. Their positions are used to define a linear transformation between the detection image and the zeroth order. The scaling ratio between the matched detection and zeroth order images is determined and used to model which pixels to mask. In the HDFN the the images in F775W and F850LP are typically 32 and 21 times brighter, respectively, in count rate than the zeroth order counterparts. This scaling ratio is used to determine which pixels will have zeroth order counterparts that are brighter than sky noise level. The position of these pixels in the detection image are transformed to populate a mask for the grism image which is then grown by three pixels to account for the slight dispersion in the zeroth order. Masked pixels are set to zero at the appropriate stage of the analysis.

On Asymptotic Statistics for Geometric Routing Schemes in Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks
The most prominent effect caused by the tilt is, as noted above, the instability of the vortex. At low temperatures and for a large tilt, several initial configurations (at large enough rotation) lead to growing Kelvin waves and eventually to a creation of a vortex tangle via reconnections. However, with an initial state close to the steady state, the vortex smoothly adopts its new asymptotic form and no new vortices are generated.
It is useful to translate the energy flow ∂ET/∂ln xj into a distribution in terms of rapidity, y in the HERA frame. First we note that in the virtual photon-proton centre-of-mass (cm) frame the rapidity is given by

We can also look at candidates with motions of somewhat lower significance. In this paper, we examined the 110 stars which had Stot > 5.0. There were 72 stars with 4.0 ≤ Stot < 5.0, and they show nearly the same degree of asymmetry in their motions as our first sample. It is likely that a significant number of these stars have real proper motions. However, it will take extra effort to distinguish them from the growing number of false detections, and to check their photometry (many of them are fainter than the stars in our sample). As we sift through this set of stars with less significant motions, we can also try to improve the B and V measurements of our stars, so that we will not discard so many candidates due to their uncertain colors.

It is necessary for the algorithm to have some way to distinguish whether a proposed step should be accepted or rejected. The standard choice in the Levenberg-Marquardt method is to accept all steps that decrease the cost and reject all steps that increase the cost. Although this is a natural and safe choice, it is often not the most efficient, as we demonstrate in this section.

where τ0 is the formation time and R0 is roughly the proton size. We compute Npart and R from a Glauber model and fix the constant K so that the freeze out time in the most central collisions has a specified value τFc. Again we take ν = η/Ts = const for η/s = 1/4π, but now with T = 150 MeV for all centralities. We must now specify the second-order relaxation time τπ = βν, for which we take β = 10. The values τ0 = 1.0 fm and τFc = 10 fm then give superb agreement with data.
An important tenet of the Key Project was to exploit the redundancy of distance indicators, as shown in Figure 5, especially the four secondary distance indicators, the Tully-Fisher relation, surface brightness fluctuations, supernovae, and the fundamental plane.
ABSTRACT
Let R∞ be an infinite-rank classical bit register, i.e., R∞ is a collection of an infinite number of classical bits, each labelled by a distinct non-negative integer n ∈ [0, ∞). We shall call this register a bosonic quantum register to indicate that it has infinite rank. Each bit has two possible states and therefore R∞ contains an infinite number of classical states, each of which is of the form

Energy distributions are dominated at low angles by a peak close to the beam energy, while the amplitude and energy mean value of the peak decrease when the angle of emission increases. The production of low energy particles increases with the target charge and mass. These observations indicate that most of the emitted particles result from the projectile fragmentation during nuclear reactions.
The survival rate is larger then 50 % in all cases. Survival of clumps without undergoing tidal downsizing is rare, and happens mainly when the gap opening is implemented. In this case, moreover, the surviving probability becomes larger, reaching 90 % in the case with massive initial conditions.

In this article our aim is to show how the quantized one-dimensional harmonic oscillator can be described in quantum computational terms. This requires the introduction of a suitable Hilbert space, a quantum register, over which the computational processes are carried out. It turns out that, because bosons have no upper limit to their excitation levels, this involves a tremendous amount of mathematical redundancy. The Hilbert space dimension of the quantum register introduced is far bigger than that actually needed to describe a quantized boson, most of the states in the register being what we call transbosonic. It is in fact non-separable, i.e., has no denumerable basis, whereas the conventional Hilbert space used to describe the quantum harmonic oscillator is denumerable. We will show exactly how bosonic states are restricted to a tiny subspace of the register and remain there during the quantum computational processes involved in the quantum register approach.

Our hope then is that if GRBs can be shown to be an unbiassed tracer of star formation, then the redshift distribution of GRBs can in principle be inverted to give the global star formation rate history. The proportion of star formation occuring in different populations of galaxies, should be reflected in the proportions of such galaxies amongst the GRB hosts.

A possible error in the determination of the line position may be related to the asymmetry of the line shape. The asymmetry can be caused by blending of the Hα line, or by the variation in the LOS speeds between the heights covered by the optically thick Hα line. However, as in this study we consider not the absolute values of the LOS speeds, but the frequencies of their time variations, the latter effect not being likely to cause significant error. In this paper, we did not discuss the results of the magnetic field measurements.

Since one of the signals for Lorentz violation is a time dependence due to the rotation of the apparatus, sensitivity can be improved with a rotating turntable leading to a reduced period of oscillation and other advantages. All three groups mentioned above are in various stages of development in this direction. The Paris-based experiment has compared the output of a cryogenic sapphire microwave oscillator with a hydrogen maser, both running for several years. An improved experiment is under way at Western Australia, involving a rotating turntable with two sapphire cylinders within superconducting niobium cavities horizontally mounted with perpendicular axes. The German group has analyzed more than a year of output from two orthogonally mounted cryogenic sapphire resonators running in the optical regime. A refined experiment includes a precision turntable and better cryogenics to improve the sensitivity.

In conclusion, we have reported here a study of the charge-ordered multiferroic LuFe2O4 in the infrared and the sub-THz range, with special focus on the optical phonon region. Therein we have observed the dramatic effect of the symmetry reduction - caused by the transition at TCO = 320 K between the 2-D and 3-D charge order - both on the modes of the ab plane and on those of the c axis of the rhombohedral structure. Below TCO some phonon bands split into pairs of narrower lines, while new modes do appear. The number of the observed phonon lines, both above and below TCO, is in good agreement with a factor-group analysis of the respective cell symmetries. No evident effects on the phonon spectrum is instead detected when crossing the ferrimagnetic transition at 240 K. In the sub-THz region, a very weak electric conduction, thermally activated, is detected at high temperature, while a peak becomes evident in the low-temperature optical conductivity, possibly accompanied by a broad absorption at higher frequency. For that feature, similar to the one reported previously in time-domain experiments, we have proposed an interpretation related to the charge order rather than to ferroelectricity, and based on a comparison with similar sub-THz spectra recently obtained in charge-ordered manganites at low temperature.
Introduction
We take the view that a sequential program is in essence a sequence of instructions, and that the execution of an instruction sequence involves the processing of instructions by an execution environment offering a family of services and may yield a Boolean value at termination. Interaction with services concerning the processing of instructions is deemed to form part of the behaviour exhibited by the instruction sequence under execution. We introduce a composition operator for families of services and three operators that have a direct bearing on the processing of instructions. Although all terms that can be build by means of these operators denote something, some of them are not really intended to denote anything. Therefore, we propose to comply with conventions that exclude the use of such terms.
By comparing the first and the last expression in the above sequence of equalities, it follows that

The timing observations described here were carried out in the total intensity phased array mode at 610 MHz. In this mode of operation, the array needs to be phased up before observing the target pulsars. This is achieved by recording the correlator data for a point source calibrator, solving for the antenna based gains and phases from these, and applying the phases as corrections to the output of the Fourier Transform stage of the correlator. The array remains phased for up to a few hours and dephases due to slow changes in instrumental and ionospheric phases. When this happens, one needs to rephase the array to proceed with further observations.

The energy-dependent efficiency of the photomultiplier detector noise cut was first estimated, from simulations, to be in the region 70-90%. As stated in our paper, we were able to confirm this by comparing the fitted AmBe neutron source response in various energy intervals below 10 keV with and without applying the noise cut. It is these experimental efficiencies which are used in our Table 2. It should also be noted that, for the second population observed in both the AmBe neutron source runs and ambient runs, the individual pulses were examined and found to be of the shape characteristic of particle events, and not the shape observed for electronic or photomultiplier tube noise events.

The behavior of LPA is not stable because of the randomness. Different communities may be detected in different runs over the same network. Moreover, by assuming that a node always adopts the label of the majority of its neighbors, LPA ignores any other structural information existing in the neighborhood of this node. Another drawback for LPA is that it can only handle disjoint and non-overlapping communities. However, in real cases, one member in a network might span multiple communities. For instance, one may naturally belong to several social groups like friends, families, and schoolmates.

To derive fuller benefit from the existence of the CVM, we have added new C implementations of existing operations (even when Python implementations were almost as efficient) in order to avoid context switches.

We have since added a wrapper in C that calls the GEMV routine directly.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Concluding comments
Belkus et al. presented an easy evolutionary recipe for very massive stars. The latter is combined with our own direct N-body code and with our massive star evolution handler to simulate the early evolution of MGG-11. We adopt a starburst model with 3000 massive stars with solar type metallicity and a King density distribution with a half mass radius of 0.5 pc (more details are given in Vanbeveren et al., 2008 and in Belkus et al., 2008). The main conclusion is that stellar wind mass loss during CHB does not prevent the formation of a very massive object, but when the merger process stops and when this object becomes a very massive star, stellar wind mass loss determines its further evolution and an IMBH is not formed. This argues against the sub-Eddington model of the ULX in MGG-11.
In general, the solutions of (46) can be expressed in terms of elliptic functions. It is easy to obtain the correspondent function u.
The final global data reconstruction is performed asynchronously, using the O2 facility if CPU power is available or via the same scheme as during Runs 1 and 2 which is using the Tier-0 and 1 of the LHC grid. The final user analyses will be performed in a small number (2-3) of analysis facilities. The chosen sites will have very good network connectivity and a large, efficient local disk buffer dedicated to the storage of an entire set of active ALICE AODs. The Tier-2 centres of the LHC grid will be dedicated to the physics simulation production.

One other observation is that representation learning can be regarded as a special case of metric learning; because for every mapping, we can define a distance function that computes the distance in the mapped space. In this light, we can make the problem more general by making the learner find a distance function rather than a mapping. This is more challenging to analyze, because we do not even know a generalization bound for center-based clustering under general distance functions. An open question will be providing such general results.

When an event collection is read, a RooInputEventSelector object is created by the RooEventInput module in the initialisation phase. This object is used by RooEventInput in the event loop to locate events using the information from the event collection. The RooInputEventSelector descends through any hierarchies of event collections until the original location of an event as an index into a tree is found. The event location is passed to all RooInput Streams controlled by the RooEventInput module, which take care of any necessary closing and opening of files in the KANGA data store.
We recall here that every finite distributive lattice admits a unique representation (up to isomorphism) as J(P), for P some finite poset (which in fact is easily constructible from the lattice as the sub-poset of join-irreducibles). In each of the cases described above, the bijection between the combinatorial objects described and order ideals of an associated poset P is easily implemented on a computer. Thus, if we can solve the problem of generating a random element of J(P) for an arbitrary finite poset P, we will have solved the problem of generating random d-factors of bipartite planar graphs, the problem of generating random independent sets in a general bipartite graph, and many other problems as well.
Now consider H < Hres. As the temperature is raised, vortices and anti-vortices are created and Tc is reached when their halos overlap.

Extended gluing theorem
In this paper, a system which consists of two D4 branes intersecting at a very small angle θ is considered, in which the distance between two D4 brane is much larger than the string length. We regard θ as inflaton and study the inflation of D4 brane cosmology. Since the brane system will minimize its energy and make branes become parallel, when the compactification radii are fixed, the changing of θ is mainly connected with that of the homology class of each brane, in which the homology class of this system is still conservative for a well-defined theory. We calculate the amplitudes of the density perturbation and gravitational waves and give some constraints on the parameters of model.

Currently, the profile of the frequency sweeps is calculated to be piece-wise quadratic in time, over a duration of 3 ms. For shorter transport times we observe an increase in the number of atoms lost during rearrangement. For the experiments reported in the main text, atom losses are only slightly increased compared to the expected lifetime in static traps (see Fig. S2). These losses depend on the distance that the atoms move, and it is possible that they could be reduced by changing the length or the profile of the frequency sweep to minimize acceleration and jerk during the trajectory. However, the fidelity of our rearrangement would not be significantly improved by minimizing these losses (see Fig. 3B of the main text).

These will be of order a for the Wilson fermionic action and of order αSa for the clover fermionic action. The other lattice approximation that needs to be checked is the finite lattice size used.

We reiterate that this method is not intended to act as a replacement for full hydrodynamical simulations which aim to model the star formation process itself, i.e. the fragmentation of molecular clouds into prestellar cores and finally multiple protostellar systems. The fragmentation of gas into stars is a complex hydrodynamical problem, involving much additional physics such as radiation transport, chemistry, and (non-ideal) MHD. We suggest that fragmentation should be artificially supressed for a number of reasons. Firstly, we wish to avoid the complex physics and computational expense related to full hydrodynamical simulations since we are only currently interested in the global effects of the gaseous gravitational potential on the N-body evolution of the cluster. Secondly, if fragmentation occurs then sink particles should be introduced and it is unclear how to mix sink particles with N-body star particles (one will be softened and interacting hydrodynamically with the gas, the other will not despite both representing a star).
We believe that the results concerning the eigenfunctions HR are of independent interest.

Given the wealth of data in live chat systems, this research proposes a novel data mining approach to evaluate customer experience from unstructured chat dialogs. We explored the opportunity to mind the minds of customers based on a set of features about sessions and sentiments. By analyzing unstructured chat content, we can extract the possible feedbacks buried in chat logs and determine (1) what topics are being discussed in chat logs, (2) what sentiments those chats accompany, and (3) what the overall satisfaction level of customers is.
The two network alternatives are explored: classification and regression. As observed in the action recognition case, we did not benefit from extracting partial derivatives with respect to the weights of the hidden layers, and hence we only use those of the output layer as our representation.

But in the following sections I will examine various forms complementarity, in light of the present formulation of the paradox; and I will find that firewalls are still required for unitarity.

In our case the values on the observed radio map is a sum of a cosmological signal we try to measure, a receiver noise, the Galactic radiation, and perhaps some signal related with neglected systematic effects. It is the cosmological signal that we are interested in, so the other components remain to be carefully estimated, significantly reduced or to be completely excluded. In an ideal case (no Galactic radiation and no systematic effects) the procedure would not cause a significant change in the cosmological signal parameters.

Suppose we had just a two-qubit quantum computer. We could easily convert the two-dimensional model into a one-dimensional model by alternating qubits from the line associated with the first data qubit with the line associated with the second data qubit (so we would have a qubit from data block 1 followed by a qubit from data block 2, then a level 0 ancilla qubit for data block 1, then a level 0 ancilla qubit for data block 2, and so on). In this model, each ancilla will have to move exactly twice as far as in the two-dimensional case, so there will still be a threshold, though it will be half as large. To interact the two data qubits, we should perfectly align the blocks, so that qubit number 57 from block 1 is right next to qubit number 57 from block 2. However, if the logical qubits do not need to interact, there is no reason the blocks need to be aligned. We will still be able to perform error correction on the blocks separately, even if they are out of phase.

Physicists are willing to find and adopt new physical principles, laws that expand their knowledge of the universe. Mathematicians, standard and formal ones, tend to stick rigidly to axioms and not to modify them. They should adopt a more experimental attitude. With Turing, the fields of Mathematics and Physics become more unified.
Let A be an abelian variety of dimension g and let Θ ⊂ A be a theta divisor. In other words, Θ is an ample divisor such that h0(A, Θ) = 1. We call the pair (A, Θ) a principally polarized abelian variety or ppav, with Θ uniquely determined up to translation. In this paper we assume Θ is smooth.
In summary, we have made a general model-independent study of the possible baryon and lepton number violations beyond the standard model with scalar bilinears. Depending on the processes under consideration, they can be classified into only a few categories. We list all the trilinear and quartic couplings and discuss the processes to which these operators contribute.

Two magnetic flux loops are installed to monitor the plasma diamagnetism. Each loop consists of a single circular turn of a coaxial cable with major radius 5.2 cm and minor radius 1.1 mm. The loops are located 1 cm away from the magnet casing surface, such that the plane of each loop is 8.0 cm from the chamber center.
However, a rough analysis indicates that reheating after domain wall inflation would not work. After the period of inflation needed for solving the cosmological flatness and horizon problems, the domain walls end up very far apart. The energy released when the domain walls disappear is at first located only near the domain walls. Even if this energy travels away from the walls at the speed of light, thermalization of a big enough patch to encompass our observable universe takes too long. If we require that the thermalization is finished at some high enough temperature (say T > MeV), then the amount of inflation would not be sufficient to completely solve the flatness and horizon problems.

In addition to the mass accretion, we also take the possibility of momentum accretion into account in our models. In the simplest assumption, the specific linear and angular momentum of the planet is not affected by the increased mass, thus the velocity of the planet in the disk is not modified by accretion. But the accreted gas, depending on its position in the disk, may have a relative velocity with respect to the planet and therefore this simple assumption does not hold necessarily. To account for this, we measure the linear momentum of the removed gas in each cell and can add its sum to the linear momentum of the planet as we increase its mass. This way we avoid taking into account the rotation (spin) of the planet around its own axis and ensure conservation of linear momentum. Obviously the linear momentum and the orbital angular momentum of the planet are strongly coupled, so if the planet changes its linear momentum this way, it will also change its orbital angular momentum around the star.
We now discuss how the interchain coupling affects the magnetization process in the Q1D system, following the procedure outlined above. In the following we will explicitly use the bare external field H instead of H̃ (H = H̃ + hu).

As mentioned, the possibility of GHZ state simulation with bounded communication is an open problem. Here, we give a step towards solving this problem: a simple communication complexity task that is possible to solve if GHZ entanglement simulation is possible. This implies that if we can somehow show that this simple task is impossible to accomplish, then the general task of GHZ simulation would also be impossible. We believe that this task somehow captures the essence of GHZ state simulation, and would be surprised if it turns our that the task is achievable, whereas the general GHZ state simulation is not. Our new task can easily be generalized to n parties and is given by the following:
In this work an attempt is made to answer the following questions. Firstly, can one identify the various eigenstate classes in a manner that is not dependent on visualizing the high dimensional wavefunctions quantum mechnically or semiclassically? More importantly, such a method should be able to make contact with the relevant structures like periodic orbits and their bifurcations in the high dimensional classical phase space. Secondly, do the eigenstate classes and sequences identified previously persist when using a higher order and more accurate Hamiltonian? Finally, is there a possibility of new modes being born due to specific bifurcations in the system?
The canonically normalized scalar field σ is related to σ̃ by
In the study of brane-worlds and their applications two main approaches could be considered. In the first, more traditional approach one starts from the higher dimensional theory which gives the higher dimensional bulk solution (say, AdS space). The next step is to get the necessary brane universe. In order to achieve this one adds by hands some boundary terms (brane vacuum energy). In this way, almost any brane universe may be easily obtained.
Finally, to lift the degeneracy of the spin states of the atoms and avoid losses due to spin flips at the centre of the waveguide a further magnetic field, Bip, parallel to the direction of the wires is usually applied.
This is the criterion of dynamical stability that Maxwell uses, though he does not use the term explicitly here.
The most prominent spectroscopic signal during a transit is the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. This effect is an anomalous Doppler shift that arises from stellar rotation. Measuring this effect allows one to assess the alignment between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar spin axis, a fundamental system property that provides clues about the process of planet migration. I describe some recent measurements of the RM effect in § 3.

Our dataset consists of 126M photos with Exif geolocations mined from all over the web. We applied very little filtering, only excluding images that are non-photos (like diagrams, clip-art, etc.) and porn. Our dataset is therefore extremely noisy, including indoor photos, portraits, photos of pets, food, products and other photos not indicative of location. Moreover, the Exif geolocations may be incorrect by several hundred meters due to noise. We split the dataset into 91M training images and 34M validation images.

The flux through dS is equal to the sum of the fluxes from all layers, which are located away from dS at the distances from 0 to λ.

Lattice construction of Quantum Field Theories
In this study, we have developed a new method for the construction of archeomagnetic pdf from inclination, declination, and intensity data. Our method is based on Gaussian process regression and it incorporates a priori information consistent with the statistics obtained from historical geomagnetic data. Markov Chain Monte Carlo applied on the dates of observations selects random distribution of dates with the highest probabilities. The Huber norm is applied to deal efficiently with outliers. This new method has several advantages: first it avoids the use of arbitrary regularization, and any unspecified filtering introduced by the projection onto support functions such as cubic B-splines; it furthermore allows to account for dating errors in a probabilistic framework.

In high-dimensional phenotypic readouts, we may encounter a situation in which a considerable part of all observables does not react to any intervention at all.

Once chiral perturbation theory is set up, the inequalities we get for the parameters of the lagrangian cannot depend on which space the inequalities are treated. It is a technicality to pass from one space to the other, the physical content remaining the same. Coordinate space allows a far simpler analysis due to the trivial decoupling of subtractions at large distances.

More generally, the massive spread in the last decade of online social networking has the obvious consequence of generating very large relational data sets. While non vector data have been studied for quite a long time, those new data sets push the complexity one step further by mixing several types of non vector data. Objects under study are now described by complex mixed data (texts, images, etc.) and are related by several networks (friendship, online discussion, etc.). In addition, the temporal dynamic of those data cannot be easily ignored or summarized. It seems therefore that the next set of problems faced by the machine learning community will include graphs in numerous forms, including dynamic ones.
For unital substitution-stable universal algebras this characterization can be improved as follows.

For concreteness consider a system with one relevant operator, denoted by m, that has a scaling dimension ym > 0. All other operators, denoted by gi, are irrelevant with scaling exponents yi < 0. Renormalization group arguments predict that in a finite spatial volume L3, MH depends only on specific combinations of the couplings, and can be written as

In this article, we specifically target covert communications over acoustical emanations, utilizing speakers and microphones (available in commonly available computing systems) as sending and receiving devices (see 1) that are commonly accessible (see 2) to application partitions of the operating systems that might be in need to process audio (e.g., for video conferencing or IP phone communications). Speakers and microphones are also not established as means for communication and are not widely considered in security and network policies (see 3). Regarding 4, stealthy communication can be implemented in acoustical networks by utilizing inaudible frequencies, i.e., the ultrasonic and near-ultrasonic frequency ranges.

We did not extensively experiment with different network configurations. However, small variations in network depth and width did not seem to have significant effect on performance. Some of the design choice also take into account the input voxel resolution. We chose two convolutional layers for encoder to extract robust feature at multiple scales. Learning a robust shape representation essentially means capturing the correlation between different voxels. Thus, receptive field of convolutional filter plays a major role and we observe the best performance with large conv filters in the first layer and large deconv filter in the last layer. We experimented with two types of loss functions: mean square loss and cross entropy loss. Since we have only two classes, there is not much variation in performance with cross entropy being slightly better.

The presence of long-range polarization forces causes the effects of the impurity-helium interactions to extend over a considerable amount of solvent atoms within the cluster structure. We have therefore analyzed a broad range of cluster sizes for a nonvibrating molecular partner in order to unravel such effects in the title systems and to relate them to their specific interaction potentials.

which can be solved for r and subsequently obtaining α0 and s. The drawback is that r and s are required to be integers, so we cannot arbitrarily choose m, n and ρ. To give an idea of the situation we present some tables, assuming for simplicity that both m and n are integers. It follows that also α0 has to be an integer. Because we want a negative correlation and because α0 ≥ 0 we have the restriction

For a source with a Gaussian brightness profile, for example, the Visibility function will also decrease with a Gaussian profile, and the half-maximum width of the Visibility function will be inversely proportional to the half-maximum width of the source brightness distribution.

There are a few interesting consequences of this formula. First, the scalar curvature does not have a sign; it is positive when |x | is small and then becomes negative near infinity. Second, as |x | →∞, the scalar curvature goes to negative infinity. It follows that the space is not complete; even though infinity is at a finite distance, there is no way to smoothly extend the metric to a neighborhood of infinity.
Then, for a specific frequency of the burst, the density at the shock producing the burst is calculated and the corresponding height (h) can be found from the revised density distribution. Finally, we can get the speed of the shock from the frequency drift rate.

When performing the tree-level matching, going from left- and right-handed currents to vector and axial currents is straightforward.

In order to shed light on all these issues, we have rigorously studied the probability distribution of the system through microcanonical approach and shown that it stems from the interplay between any arbitrary system and the constant heat capacity of the bath. Only when the bath has finite and constant negative heat capacity, the system attains an inverse power law distribution with fat tails. The finite baths with positive constant heat capacity lead to the system distributions with a well-determined cut-off condition leaving no possibility for the emergence of fat tails.
MODEL AND THEORETIC APPROACHES
Authors conclude that their scheme (DCQD) is more optimal than the remaining two. This result is illustrated in the Table II of their paper. They claim the following (for n qubits):
The differential equations for propagation of the signal, pump and ASE powers are given, respectively, as follows
As in the case where d = 2, we sum the sizes of all hyperedges in H. There is at most 1 hyperedge of size 0 and at most q many hyperedges of size 1. First we show that there are not too many hyperedges of size 2 in H.
In this section we consider a model of statistical mechanics on a Cayley tree. The Cayley tree Γk = (V, L) of order k ≥ 1 is an infinite tree, i.e., a graph without cycles, from each vertex of which exactly k + 1 edges issue. Here V is the set of vertices and L is the set of edges of Γk.
Now, consider the bounce solutions for the kink potential and the cap potential outside the cap region. Even for large r these two solutions only coincide approximately. It might well be that one of the two solutions passes a given point in the potential a little bit later but compensates by a slightly smaller velocity. The former effect leads to a reduced friction that is compensated by the latter effect.
On the other hand, if the outliers are pure stochastic (i.e. we are dealing with a low-probability noise sample) the noise estimation bias may arise and, as a result may arise the signal estimation bias. We simulated this occasion for the signal and noise with the given spectrum and to examine noise outliers stronger than 2.3σ. After that we calculated the signal estimates both for censored and non-censored spectra.

Coupled fluctuations in a plane. A) A particle (P) is constrained by two springs which are oriented along the y, z coordinate axes (shown by the two arrows). ky, kz denotes the spring stiffnesses along y, z. B) A particle (P) constrained by two springs that are misaligned by an angle θ with respect to the coordinate axes. C) Level curves and marginal distributions for the joint equilibrium probability distribution of the particle position in the two systems shown in panels A (solid curves) and B (dashed curves). If the two springs have very different stiffnesses, the level curves form highly eccentric ellipses. In this situation a rotation by a small angle θ in the joint distribution can lead to a large change in the marginal distribution for y. The large difference in stiffness acts as a lever arm amplifying the strength of the coupling.

In the first of the two cases we dealt with, the evolution from a physical state to a gauge dependent zero norm state is not a problem if that state is orthogonal to all physical states of positive norm. However, the production of a ghost-antighost state of negative norm by starting with a two gluon state of positive norm is a serious difficulty for this operator formulation of QCD. Nevertheless, the ghost and anti-ghost which were introduced into the path integral quantization of gauge theories as fictitious particles restores locality and the calculational convenience of Feynman diagrams.

Comparative data may also be useful to resolve these hypotheses. The decline of human endocranial volume during the last 10,000 years is paralleled most obviously by the reductions of brain size in domesticated animal species, including dogs, cattle and sheep, compared to their wild progenitors. Nutritional, developmental, and functional issues are all possible explanations for these parallel cases of brain size reduction. Humans are different in many ways from these domesticated species, but exhibit other parallel trends such as decreased skeletal robusticity.

In this article we have discussed how toric geometry can be used to construct a large number of geometries that can support global F-theory GUTs. Using this technology we could show that elementary consistency constraints greatly reduce the number of possible models. However, due to computational constraints, we did not quite succeed in systematically listing all possible F-theory models within a class of geometries. Such an endeavor would require substantial changes in the computer programs we are using. It is actually quite remarkable that we could make use of PALP for Calabi-Yau fourfolds and non-Calabi-Yau threefolds, since this goes beyond what it was originally designed for.

This sequence gives rise to the following inequalities.
Once the metadata has been set up, the generator object for the entity (i.e., entity generator) will start the creation of the synthetic records. The Entity generator acts as the controller to run the sub generators corresponding to each of the demographic attributes: Once the entity object is created, it will be made available to the other sub generators so they can use it in their generation process. The entity generator has also the logic to respect a set of constraints between some of the attributes (one of the main characteristics of realistic datasets). This logic ensures to assign realistic values for the attributes. For example, when generating marital status, it is important to consider that most of the population between 15 and 19 years are single thus the generator should not assign a widowed status, which is less likely.

About 3% of all known white dwarfs have strong magnetic fields between 106 and 109 Gauss (Wickramasinghe & Ferrario 2000, Jordan 2001). The detailed surface structure of the magnetic field can be inferred from time-resolved spectro-polarimetric observations, which give integrals of the polarized radiation over the stellar surface visible at a given rotational phase. Because the magnetic field varies in strength and direction, theoretical calculations for polarized radiative transfer have to be performed at many (typically 1000) different points on the surface. In order to ensure numerical accuracy and efficiency, we have tested four different methods from the literature for solving the radiative transfer equations in magnetized white dwarf atmospheres. Note that the ALI (Accelerated Λ-Iteration) method is described in more detail by Deetjen et al. in these proceedings.

We speculate that the mean free path in these grains is significantly longer that the mean free path in grains formed by nucleation.

We determined the capacity of a Gaussian AVC with an additive Gaussian state in the presence of an adversary, where the state is known to the encoder as well as the adversary. The surprising fact that the worst-case adversary disregards state knowledge and inputs white Gaussian noise into the channel was proved. Overall, it was shown that the effect of the state was completely eliminated and the capacity of a Gaussian AVC with state and a state-aware adversary is equal to that of a standard Gaussian AVC with no state and an independent adversary.
Two variations of the concentric rotating cylinder (Taylor-Couette) system were employed to test the concepts of section 2. The systems break the rotational symmetry in very different ways.

Because of βn ≪ 1 this number is less than one. It means that at the collapse time t0 the formation of condensed phase does occur, secondly, the energy gathered by the condensate particles during the collapse is quite large and so there exists the unique possibility to transfer this energy (or a significant amount of it) to undercondensate particles radiated from the vicinity of the singularity. It is very important also that while weak collapse the attraction potential will be formed for other non-collapsing particles which can be trapped after t0.

Through a series of steps we show how to obtain a convex program with a l1-like penalty term that encourages sparsity. We evaluate our approach on synthetic as well as real-world email and viral marketing datasets. Experiments reveal that we can near-perfectly recover the underlying network structure as well as the parameters of the propagation model. Moreover, our approach scales well since we can infer optimal networks of a thousand nodes in a matter of minutes.

Introduction
A particularity of this new detector technique is the fact that the readout electronics are independent (and thus exchangeable) from the micromegas structure. The elements of the structure are optimized in such a way that the electronic signal is not lost through the resistive layer but is propagated to a separate plane, carrying read-out pads or strips, by capacitive coupling. In order to optimize the induced signal by capacitive coupling the thickness of the insulating ceramic (t2) must be kept small to satisfy the relation

In effect, the randomization test replaces the unknown tail probability p∞ with a biased estimator (b + 1)/(m + 1), the amount of positive bias being just enough to allow for the uncertainty of estimation and to produce a test with the correct size. This p-value calculation is presented in a number of textbooks on randomization tests including Davison and Hinkley (1997), Manly (1997) and Edgington and Onghena (2007).

Thus, though the generators we have found in L might not directly correspond to side-pairing transformations of a fundamental domain for Γ, they still generate the fundamental group Γ of the punctured surface.
Therefore, for fixed q,
The basic phenomenon is due to the exchange of energy between the alkali atoms and the rare gas atoms. Two effects are important: i) the alkali-rare gas interaction has a longer range than the rare gas-rare gas interactions so that the expansion cooling goes on for a longer time for the alkali atoms; ii) the mass ratio plays an important role in the energy exchange between the two species and, as shown below, the parallel temperature of the seeded gas (mass m2 ) is considerably lower than the parallel temperature of the carrier gas (mass m1 ) when m2 ≪ m1.
which merely reverses the roles of acceptor and donor, but still operates forwards in time.
After generating the flow in the dust fluid, it is equally important to accurately measure the velocity of the flow so as to properly decipher the underlying physical mechanism responsible for the flow induced excitations of linear/nonlinear waves and vortex structures. To study the properties of these waves/structures in a detailed manner, it also sometimes becomes essential to make a coordinate transformation from the laboratory frame to the fluid frame for which it is necessary to know the fluid velocity. Furthermore, several theoretical studies predict that the wave behaviour undergoes drastic changes when the fluid flow velocity changes its magnitude from subsonic to supersonic values. In some of the dusty plasma experiments, in which the dust dynamics plays an important role, the estimation of different forces (e.g. neutral drag force, ion drag force, electrostatic force etc.) acting on the flowing dust particles are very crucial. For such experiments, time varying measurements of the fluid velocity can provide useful information to estimate these forces. Thus precise measurements of the fluid velocity are crucial for investigating the propagation characteristics of flow induced excitations of linear/non-linear waves as well as for estimating the fundamental forces acting on the dust particles.

Star clusters are subject to a variety of internal and external mechanisms that, under the appropriate conditions, will gravitationally unbind and subsequently disrupt them. These effects include (see de Grijs & Parmentier 2007), approximately as a function of increasing timescale, (i) formation in a marginally bound state (see also the review by Mac Low & Klessen 2004), (ii) rapid removal of the intracluster gas due to adiabatic or explosive expansion driven by stellar winds or supernova activity, typically on timescales much shorter than the proto-cluster dynamical crossing time, (iii) mass loss due to normal stellar evolution (including the effects of stellar winds and supernova explosions), (iv) internal two-body relaxation effects, leading to dynamical mass segregation and the preferential ejection of lower-mass stars, (v) release of energy stored in a significant fraction of primordial hard binary systems, and (vi) tidal and gravitational effects due to interactions with other significant mass components, spiral arms, bulge or disc shocking and dynamical friction.

The choice of the time-span of two years after the end of the proprietary period was motivated by two factors. On the one hand, the more timely the information from the PIs is received, the faster the observatory can react. On the other hand, in order to maximise the usefulness of the survey, the time-span should be long enough that enough time was available to produce a publication under normal circumstances.
Simply knowing that a gluino of some approximately measured mass decays to a chargino + jets of some pT puts a valuable upper limit on the chargino mass (and therefore the dark matter mass). With more information, it may be possible to obtain a precise measurement of the chargino mass. For instance, measuring the pT of the soft pion resulting from the chargino decay along with the chargino track 3-momentum might allow a kinematic reconstruction of the chargino mass. However, it is unclear whether or not measuring such a soft track would be experimentally feasible. Other experimental approaches, such as determining the dE/dx spectra of the chargino tracks, can also refine measurements of the chargino mass.

We also compare results for different lattice sizes, ie for four to eight lattice sites. For more than five lattice sites and U/J ≥ 20, the changes in results become very modest (see Fig. 7). Even for the smaller configurations, i.e. four and five sites, the important features are still in very good qualitative agreement. This leads us to be reasonably confident of the relevance of the principal features of our calculations for larger realistic systems.

The contextual information also has a probability measure attached to it. As shown in the figure, the probability of temperature reading, from TempSensor1, being correct is 0.1 which means it is highly unreliable and that the sensor could be faulty. This is evident by the fact that it shows a reading of 10 deg Fahrenheit while the other sensor shows a reading of 150 deg Fahrenheit. Also, the contextual information has source or provenance information attached to it and so this determines which reading came from which sensor. Based on the temperature reading and its encoding (Fahrenheit in this case), the system can calculate how much time it will take till the temperature reaches the value at which the building bursts into flames. This is the amount of time that the responders have for evacuation.

The key factor in determining the impact of a fast wind is likely to be the distance it travels before colliding with the ISM or previous ejecta. Compton cooling will dominate for a shock occurring close to the AGN continuum source, with the Compton cooling time and mean flow speed then determining the shell thickness of the hotter, more highly ionised flow component. However, in the later stages of the flow the density is likely to increase to the point where two-body cooling becomes important, and then perhaps dominant.

We have shown how to find flow in near linear time when the input graph is a clique-sum of planar and bounded tree-width graphs by using mimicking networks to iteratively simplify the graph. This technique allows us to use known near linear algorithms in each bounded tree-width or planar component of the decomposition.

In this article, we have presented in detail the APIS service. This primarily consists of a high level database, made of several data levels derived for most of the HST-FUV STIS and ACS spectro-imaging auroral observations acquired since 1997, with very diverse instrumental configurations. A dedicated search interface accessible on the APIS portal enables the user to efficiently browse and sort out these data, which can be used interactively with VO softwares such as Aladin and Specview. The database is also compliant with the EPN-TAP protocol, so that it can also be queried by external VO tools. We have presented a few examples of science studies easy to perform with this service.

Results
Simple simulations have reproduced some of the differences in spiral galaxy morphology in the optical and infrared. These differences can be explained by the dynamics of stars and gas, without invoking interactions, star formation or dust obscuration. In particular, gas images are more flocculent with lower pitch angles than stellar images. Stellar arm-interarm contrast and Q correlate inversely with the degree of decoupling. The effect of gas self-gravity is not known, but it is needed to model the full range of galaxies self-consistently.

We have argued that the fundamental plane analysis presented here is a powerful tool to extend the unified scheme of accreting black holes. Such a relation between mass, radio and hard X-ray luminosity is affected very little by obscuration and beaming, provided that sources whose relativistic jets are in our line of sight can be effectively identified and excluded. Thus, the fundamental plane relation does not depend on orientation, and as such is complementary to the standard unification scheme. Moreover, the relation itself is perfectly consistent with the scaling relations predicted by standard synchrotron theory under a scale invariance assumption. The main scaling parameters are the mass of the black hole and its accretion rate. Finally, we have shown how the observed correlation can be effectively used to classify objects on the basis of their mode of accretion (and/or accretion/ejection coupling) rather than just on specific observational characteristics, as in the true spirit of unification models.

Thirty-four of our sources are members of the third EGRET gamma-ray catalog, and broken down by optical classification there are 95 quasars, 21 BL Lacs, 10 radio galaxies, and 8 unidentified objects. Redshift information is currently available for 90% of the sample.

The Effect of a Periodic Pinning Potential: Current Oscillations
The formulas used throughout this paper are presented in the next section. Section 3 applies these formulas to the one loop expansion in order to analyze ππ phase shifts. In section 4, the relevant form factors are modeled in the simplest form consistent with data and used with the master formula approach to fit phase shifts far above the threshold region. Comparison with chiral perturbation theory (χPT) results is made throughout. Our conclusions are summarized in section 5.
We now evaluate the energy shift of the ground-state energy due to the interaction of the two harmonic oscillators with the electromagnetic field. The ground-state energy has terms which depend on the distance r between the two oscillators; this yields a Casimir-Polder potential between the two oscillators.

An analytical technique, based on the properties of the GFs in presence of branching sites, is developed and illustrated by means of amany examples. This technique, which we call bud-reduction, allows to account for an entire substructure of the network under examination by means of a sort of on-site potential of geometrical origin. It can also be performed telescopically, meaning that the bud-reduced branches may in turn carry substructures which have already undergone bud-reduction. This tool yields a topological simplification of the structure under examination and allows a better understanding of the effect of each substructure on the spectral properties of the system. For this reason it is very promising from the point of view of reverse engineering: the insight gained on the effects of different topologies may be a guide in designing networks displaying the desired spectral features.

That is, Σ is clusterable.

Statistical mechanics captures correctly the properties of single macroscopic systems. Nevertheless, the quantum statistical description of such macroscopic systems uses the concept of a mixed state, characterized by a density matrix that is diagonal in the basis of the energy eigenstates, with the probabilities of the quantum states being given by the entries of this matrix. The standard interpretation of the density matrix is that of an ensemble of systems, with the probabilities giving the proportion of systems in the different quantum mechanical states. In this interpretation, the description of the system as in a mixed state is again due to our ignorance of the full microscopic details. The probabilities are again subjective probabilities. This is in striking contrast to the fact that the mixed density matrix is so successful at describing the properties of single macroscopic systems, for instance when correlation functions or thermodynamic variables are calculated. A mixed state should therefore be taken as capturing something correct about an individual system, namely that a macroscopic system is not in a pure quantum state and cannot be described by a N-particle wave function. Let us therefore discuss which properties a system should have if it shall be described correctly by a the density matrix of a mixed state. First, let us take up the suggestion of Landau and Lifschitz to imagine the system as composed of statistically independent parts. For the sake of simplicity, let all parts be of identical size. If the density matrix is taken to be that of a part, all the parts together form an ensemble. Then, the probabilities occuring in the density matrix can be interpreted as probabilities for the different states of the different parts. Now add to this the idea that there are random transitions between the states of each part. Then the assumptions that the parts are statistically independent from each other and that the entries of the density matrix represent objective probabilities become justified, and it follows that a mixed density matrix is a good description of the system.

As we will see, intervals lacking strict nestedness is equivalent to their corresponding p-values being discontinuous in θ.

On the contrary to K-means, here one may not expect to develop a series of classifications consisting of different number of classes; elastic map technique provides a unique clusterization of the multi-dimensional data. Few words should be said towards the local density colouring. This is very useful and informative tool to analyze the data. To develop the colouring, one must supply each data point image at the surface with the Gaussian function centered at the point image; a specific width (equivalent to standard deviation of a normal distribution function) of the function is a free parameter chosen by researcher.

In this situation of totality of mutual correlations it is natural to consider a prequantum grand field. Random fields corresponding to quantum systems are simply random signals generated by such a grand field. Hence, this work can be considered as a step towards classical unified field theory. However, this is a very preliminary step.

In an Unsecured Loan, the borrower typically has an obligation to make certain payments of principal and interest at certain times. An unremedied failure to do so is defined as an event of default and triggers the lender’s right to take recovery action. Accordingly it is relatively simple to assess whether an Unsecured Loan has defaulted. One simply determines whether the borrower has failed to make a required payment, and any allowed remedy period has passed without the appropriate remedy occurring. Further, it is relatively simple to define a historical PD for a given sample of loans. One simply determines whether or not each loan has defaulted as above and derives the proportion of loans which have defaulted. This historical PD can then be used as an objective starting point for deciding on a forward-looking PD.

A great deal of observational firepower will be directed at the problem of star formation in the coming years, but we already know one essential fact: star formation is a collective process. Most stars (perhaps nearly 100% in our Galaxy) form in clusters. There are strong interactions with the surrounding environment and among protostars. Quantifying feedback processes, both positive and negative, is a key to understanding star formation. All this means that star formation is a more difficult problem than was the astrophysics of isolated stars. Progress will be importantly informed by observations of other galaxies and a wider range of environments than are found in our Galaxy.

This is the typical expression for the quantum break time provided the system is near an instability, where quantum break time denotes the time scale for the breakdown of the classical (mean field) description.

Yet another explanation would be the presence of a large, hot/bright or cool/dark convective cell, with a lifetime of a few tens of LSPs. This would result in rotational variability whose amplitude varied, as bright convective cells grew and decayed. (We note, however, that Stothers (2010) estimates the turnover timescale as being closer to LSP than to 20-30 LSPs.) The rotation periods of red giants can be estimated from their projected rotational velocities (v sin i) (Zamanov et al. 2008) and their radii (Zamanov et al. 2007) using the formula P = 50.6R/v where P is the period in days, R is the radius in solar units, and v is the equatorial rotational velocity in km/s. For stars in the range M1III to M6III, the rotational periods range mostly from 500 to 1000 days. Figure 9 shows the LSP and the rotation period of stars as a function of spectral type. The rotation periods are estimated as described above. They are highly uncertain, as a result of the uncertainty inv sin i and R, and the unknown value of sin i. We note, however, that Olivier and Wood (2003) obtained upper limits to rotation velocities in nearby stars with LSPs, and found them to be too slow for rotation of a (single) spot to yield the observed LSP values. Figure 9 suggests that the rotation is too fast.

As mass-loss driven by a radiative wind sets in, the ejecta are launched at velocities much larger than the expansion velocity of the photosphere during the fireball phase. At this stage, the ejecta emits copious amounts of free-free emission whose contribution to the infrared continuum cannot be neglected. As seen from an optical interferometer the source is now composed of two components viz the first is a stellar component where the photosphere initially expands and then rapidly shrinks to the point where it can be considered as unresolved by the instrument, and the second component being the expanding optically thin envelope whose appearance can be, to the first order, approximated by a Gaussian.

The middle MECs forward commands to the target leaf MECs to execute. They use the high bits of the row address as the physical DIMM ID for command forwarding. The routing table determines the forwarding port. For the ACT command, the ID is in the row address. For other commands, MEC1 gets the ID from the BST and passes it with the command.

Hence P(f2 , f4 ) = p is a constant, and deg f1 = deg f2 , deg f3 = deg f4 . This in turn implies Q(x1 , x3 ) = q is a constant.
Obviously, the Wigner-Weyl ordering and the anti-standard ordering are not equivalent, so they lead to different quasi-distributions. But both of these orderings are intuitive and simple ones, and appropriate phase space distribution functions have the same marginal properties.
Let Yl(e) be the set of <l-intervals Jl satisfying:
The distance calculations in kNN exhibit abundant data parallelism and is an excellent match for the AP. In von-Neumann architectures, typically the dataset vectors are streamed from memory and the number of calculations performed is limited by the rate at which vectors can be streamed from memory; for n vectors each with d dimensions this takes O(nd) time to complete the distance calculations. For the AP we instead stream the queries to the dataset vectors encoded in NFAs on the AP and perform comparisons against all candidate vectors in parallel much like a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). This allows the AP to exploit the theoretical maximal degree of data parallelism in the context of kNN and reduces the run time to O(d) per distance calculation; the only limitation is the number of spatial resources required to implement the large number of parallel automata.

Looking the Table 3 we conclude that, as expected, both exponents go to 2 with increasing D.

Let ξij, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n be independent random variables. Assume that there is a constant ρ < 1 (not depending on n) such that for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, ξij has the ρ-property. Observe that we do not require ξij be identical, and that furthermore we do not place any requirements on the diagonal elements of the matrix.
where pω, mω(P, M) are the momentum and spin projection of the ω(X) and pωK is the relative momentum of the ωK system.
Deterministic patterns are never enough to represent all systems. The one who is studying the system may not have the rules for system transition from one state to another. He may only have the results of system transition between its states. Thus, he will have to determine the states and the rules using these results. Natural languages are examples on this. When we analyze a text, we see the results of applying the grammars of a natural language; these results are the sentences that form the text. However; these grammars are not readily available for us. To get them, we must study the output of the system. We see here the advantage of Hidden Markov Models in forming sentences that follow the grammars of a natural language.

In addition to the CTI evidence, the evolution of the trailing fraction implies that the long-term radiation damage is not produced by the same spectrum of particles that produced the initial damage. The FI CCDs show a small increase in the trailing fraction which implies that there are relatively more short time constant traps than initially, while the BI CCDs which started with a much higher proportion of short time constant traps than the FI CCDs, are trending towards longer traps.

Given the recent evidence for the detection of the top quark, all the particles in the standard model have been directly detected, save for the tau neutrino and the Higgs particle. Of course, while it would not be difficult to believe in a world with no Higgs, one would be rather hard pressed to find a theory consistent with the data that did not contain a tau neutrino. Thus, I mention the direct detection issue only to point out that, compared to the other leptons, we know very little about the tau neutrino.
More surprisingly, a similar structure is also appearing at higher orders.

Convolutional Networks are trainable architectures composed of multiple stages. The input and output of each stage are sets of arrays called feature maps. In our case, the input is a color (RGB) image plus a depth (D) image and each feature map is a 2D array containing a color or depth channel of the input RGB D image. At the output, each feature map represents a particular feature extracted at all locations on the input. Each stage is composed of three layers: a filter bank layer, a non-linearity layer, and a feature pooling layer. A typical ConvNet is composed of one, two or three such 3-layer stages, followed by a classification module. Because they are trainable, arbitrary input modalities can be modeled, such as the depth modality that is added to the input channel in this work.
Each test-job started in the sp-system is typically assigned a unique ID, and all scripts and input files used in the test as well as all output files are kept. This allows the validation of all versions against each other and ensures reproducibility of previous results. In addition to this unique ID, validation jobs may be tagged with a description, indicating which software versions were used, and the Unix time stamp of the execution to aid the bookkeeping. Script-based web pages are used to record and display available validation runs for a given description and indicate the status of the compilation for the individual packages or tests within table cells, which are linked to a corresponding output file. This file may be a simple yes/no, a text file, a histogram, a root file or even a link to a further page, depending on the nature of the test.

Repeated similar calculations of factorial arguments can be avoided by noting that the factors (and denominators) of each successive term in the sum depend on the summation index k in such a way that they always change their argument by 1 for each iteration.

If we assume that the outcomes of measurements provide the values of properties of a system, then for each measurement m ∈ X there should exist an O-valued property fm: Λ → D(O) such that fm(λ)(o) = h(o | m, λ) for all λ ∈ Λ and o ∈ O.
We have presented a new pipeline for angular differential imaging which is the first, to our knowledge, to perform the critical steps of image re-centring and field de-rotation in the Fourier domain and on individual frame. By doing so, we reduce most of the image smoothing introduced by interpolation and frame binning. The resulting image noise characteristic is also preserved. This theoretical approach is validated by several test cases, where we show that excellent dynamic range and photometry retrieval are obtained at separations shorter than 1.5 arcsec compared to a standard PCA analysis.

In hierarchical CDM-like cosmogonies DLAS arise naturally from the cool gas that accumulates at the center of dark matter (DM) halos (e.g. Katz et al. 1996, Gardner et al. 1997a/b). Absorption features of low ionization species like SiII are generally believed to be good tracers of the motion of this gas in a gravitational potential well (Prochaska & Wolfe 1997, 1998). One major characteristic of these absorption features is their overall width which in HSR98 we have shown to be correlated with the circular velocity of the DM halo hosting the DLAS. However, for a halo of given circular velocity a statistical distribution of velocity widths p((vwid | vc) arises due to different orientations of the line-of-sight and different dynamical states of the gas of the DM halos. Halos with small circular velocities are believed to lose most of their gas due to feedback effects. The velocity width distribution of DLAS as probed by low ionization species can thus be written as
[La , Lb] = fabc Lc .

So far it has been shown that the model with an experimentally interesting parameter space could be compatible with standard big bang cosmology. It might be pertinent to check if there are any contraints from astrophysical considerations. An obvious constraint comes from the possible energy loss of a neutron star when ordinary particles in the star can produce shadow particles via the electromagnetic and Higgs interactions. Since the shadow particles interact very weakly with the ordinary world then there exists the possibility that the shadow matter carries off too much energy and cools the star too rapidly. An estimate of this energy loss is given by
Extending the scheme to the quark sector
Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) are commonly used in contemporary multi-wavelength astronomy because they are considered to be a powerful instrument to study the physical properties of astrophysical sources by providing a direct comparison of source luminosities in different energy bands.
Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and other randomized search heuristics have been successfully applied to countless difficult practical problems. One important reason for their popularity and their success is that they can be applied to a broad range of problems. They are usually easy to implement and they typically produce reasonable results in short time, with little effort.
While we have extensively analyzed volume holographic gates and algorithms using coupled-mode theory, paraxial wave equation simulations and finite-difference time domain simulations, we have not analyzed the engineering particulars of this device. For example: (1) how many independent writes of orthogonal states into a holographic element can be made in the PTR glass before cross-talk or saturation between the modes becomes a limiting factor? (2) Is it difficult to stack the holograms due to the enhanced angular selectivity of the volume holograms? And (3) what is the maximum number of recordings in a multiplexed PTR hologram that can be reasonably be achieved? In this sense, we are well along in understanding these devices from a theoretical prospective; however, we are at the very beginning experimentally.
Current correlators in QCD at a finite temperature T are considered from the viewpoint of operator product expansion. It is stressed that at low T the heat bath must be represented by hadronic, and not quark-gluon states. A possibility to express the results in terms of T-dependent resonance masses is discussed. It is demonstrated that in order T2 the masses do not move and the only phenomenon which occurs is a parity and isospin mixing.

While the HET design makes it possible to build a low cost telescope, there is no way to achieve comparable savings on the instrumentation packages without compromising the overall performance.

In view of the importance that the SALT partners place on such an instrument we anticipate good progress by the time this article is printed.

Firstly, all normal triangles in S link the same vertex. If this were not true, there would be normal triangles t1 and t2 in S, linking distinct vertices of τ, that intersect in common edges. This is not possible as normal arcs linking different vertices of a face are not normally isotopic. So, let v be the common vertex linked by triangles of S. Then S is a cover of S(v), as S(v) is composed of one triangle from each of the normal isotopy classes of triangles linking vertex v. As S(v) is a sphere and S is a closed connected cover of S(v), the covering projection map is a homeomorphism. Therefore, there is only one triangle of S in each normal isotopy class of triangles linking v and thus, S is normally isotopic to S(v).
The paper is organized as follows:
Another problem of consequence takes us back to dynamics: the radial velocities of 47 Tuc stars show a quite prominent rotation of the cluster (Meylan & Mayor 1986). We can in fact see rotation clearly in the proper motions too; at the cluster center they show a slightly greater dispersion in the equatorial than in the polar direction. It is obviously essential that we have a good dynamical model for the cluster. (It should also go without saying that the model should have the correct mass function for this cluster, a precept that has not always been followed. Fortunately our HST observations of the cluster provide a good mass function down to quite low masses.) For the modeling itself we intend to generalize the rotating models of Wilson (1975) to the multi-mass case.

Purely interest based recommenders may produce more novel recommendations than purely social network based recommenders. With respect to the survey rating of test-users, the purely interest based approaches perform slightly worse than the purely social network based approaches. The over-proportionally good performance of the FoF approach in reproducing known friendships can be attributed to social effects and does not have to be taken as a definitive quality criterion. Mixed approaches yield many novel recommendation while (with respect to user rating) perform as good or even slightly better than the purely social network based approach. Combined social network based and interest based approaches may thus be a good compromise and a promising field of future research.
In Go some grid points of the board are not legal moves, either because they are already occupied by a stone or due to ko rules. Therefore these points can be eliminated as possible places an expert will move a priori. During testing we account for this, but this knowledge is not present in the network during training. Informal experiments show that the classifier is able to learn to avoid predicting illegal moves with very close to 100% accuracy, but we still speculate that accounting for this knowledge during training might be beneficial because it will simplify the function the classifier is trying to learn. To accomplish this we zero out the outputs from the top layer that are illegal, and then apply the softmax operator, make predictions, and backprop the gradient across only these outputs during learning.
First, we need to see that the full spark property passes from a frame to its Naimark complement.

Because of their low opacity, the Fe II and Al II] line centroids should be more indicative of the true outflow velocities of the shocked material, and the line widths should be more indicative of turbulent velocities within the shocked material.

The differences between the results with different payoff matrices might as well reduce, if the tournament were not carried out in a binary way, but if the frequency of a strategy could take a real value and frequencies of a round were dependent on the score (fitness) of the preceding round.

One way to choose GY is as follows: if χi is a flop, choose GYi ample, general, and very small on Yi. If GYi is small enough then for all j if χj was a flip or antiflip then it still is a flip or antiflip. On the other hand now χi is a (KYi + GYi)-flip. Some other flops may have become flips or antilfips. If there are still flops repeat the process by adding, on Yk such that χk is a (KYk + GYk)-flop, a very small ample divisor to GYk, and so on until there are no flops left.

Finally, while the behavior of refractory materials such as silicon and iron is relatively insensitive to temperature, this is not the case for volatile materials for which could increase the planetary radius considerably with increasing temperature. Below, we explore how the choice of the dissociation pressure and internal temperature affect the M-R relation for methane planets, and investigate how the inclusion of a silicate (or iron) core changes the results. Finally, we identify several detected exoplanets that could be methane-rich planets.

New understanding of relations between mathematical ideas and ideas in fundamental physics can lead to progress in either field. From the earliest days of quantum mechanics, representation theory played a major role in the elucidation of atomic spectra and many other physical questions. Ideas from physics have had a huge impact on mathematics, with the Chern-Simons and Seiberg-Witten theories a recent example of this. Going forward, information is equally likely to flow from mathematics to physics, or physics to mathematics.

All four quadrants are controlled by a common Processing Electronics (PE) of CZTI which also controls all interfaces with the spacecraft. Event data acquired from the 16 detector modules of each quadrant are packaged by the quadrant wise FEB and sent to the PE every second, which then further re-packages them into larger data frames and sends to spacecraft for on-board storage. Other functions of the FPGA based PE include distribution of power from the satellite to detector quadrants, forwarding telecommands to the detectors, identifying the mode of operation based on telecommand or environment and acquiring the housekeeping parameters. PE also has an interface with a GPS based on-board satellite positioning system (SPS). The SPS provides a pulse every 16 seconds with accuracy of 200 ns, which is used for absolute time assignment for individual CZTI events. Though AstroSat is in a low inclination orbit, it has passages through South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region of increased particle concentrations. The Charge Particle Monitor (CPM) on-board AstroSat measures particle flux and provides SAA signal to all X-ray instruments including CZTI when particle flux is above a certain threshold. CZTI processing electronics detects this SAA signal and issues commands to turn off detector HV. Control of overall AstroSat spacecraft as well as data downlink from all scientific instruments is carried out from the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) located at Bengaluru. The Payload data is then sent for processing at the payload operation centers (POC) for individual payloads and the higher level data is archived by Indian Space Science Data Center (ISSDC) located at Bylalu. The payload operation center for CZTI is located at the Inter University Center for Astronomy & Astrophysics (IUCAA) at Pune.
7. Pellet injection in toroidal plasmas The complete interaction between a pellet and a plasma has not been throughly studied until now. Sato discussed our present knowledge about pellet injection. Fast density oscillations have been observed just after pellet injection. A long helical tail, which is independent of the magnetic field, has been observed.
Fig.7 shows the free energy per baryon f/nB as a function of the baryon mass density ρB with various Yp at T = 0, 1, 5 and 10 MeV. In the uniform nucleon gas phase at low density and finite temperature regime, the f/nB are not significantly altered by variations in Yp, because the interaction between nucleons is very weak at low density. When the system changes into the non-uniform matter phase, the formation of heavy nuclei can reduce f/nB, and brings appreciable Yp dependence of f/nB. All curves display a rapid rise in the high density range, which is due to the strong density dependent repulsion among nucleons in the RMF theory. We show the results of the entropy per baryon as a function of ρB with various Yp at T = 1, 5 and 10 MeV in Fig.8. The effect of the non-uniform matter phase on the entropy clearly appear in this figure. The drop of the entropy in the non-uniform matter region is due to the formation of heavy nuclei. The Yp dependence of the entropy in the non-uniform matter region is opposite to the one in the uniform matter regions when the temperature is low. This is because more heavy nuclei are formed in non-uniform matter phase at higher Yp, then they can bring more rapid drop in the entropy per baryon curves comparing with the case at lower Yp. On the other hand, the free nucleon gas outside is a dominant composition of matter at high temperature, and the effect of the formation of heavy nuclei is weakened as the temperature increases.
The action of the system is defined by
In Folded SUSY, the low energy spectrum below the scale M contains, in addition to the SM states, the scalar partners of the top quark which couple just as the stop quarks would in typical SUSY models but carry no color quantum numbers. The cancellation of the Higgs mass UV sensitivity is ensured by a supersymmetry broken at the high scale M. The light scalar uncolored top partners, dubbed the f-stops, realize an accidental supersymmetry of the low energy spectrum below M. Above M the theory contains both colored and uncolored partners of the SM particles.
Robotic search presents several challenges that traditional search algorithms do not have to consider. Traditional search algorithms require the entire search space to be both bounded and mapped. In robotic search, it is often the case that at least one of these requirements cannot be met, and environmental data must be gathered through the process of exploration. Due to this limitation, robotic search necessitates that the search path be calculated in real-time.

This is a result that we had not foreseen, and as far as we know no one else had either; but it should not have been a surprise, because in clear hindsight it is exactly what we should have expected. To understand it we must keep in mind that anisotropy is removed only by relaxation, whose rate is proportional to the star density in the regions through which a star passes. In a region like the one that we have observed, the stars of low velocity have orbits that bring them into the denser inner regions, where they have seen enough relaxation to isotropize their orbits, whereas those of higher velocity have orbits in which they have spent most of their lives in the low-density outer regions, and with less exposure to the relaxing tendency they have retained some of their anisotropy.

Nowadays, the beta and Kumaraswamy distributions are the most popular models to fit continuous bounded data. Further, these models have many features in common and in a practical situation one question of interest is how to select the most adequate model (between the beta and Kumaraswamy distributions) to fit a certain continuous bounded data set. To the best of our knowledge, it does not exist a way to discriminate the beta and Kumaraswamy models. In practical situations, the Akaike criteria has been used to do this, but this relies only on checking what is the model with great value of the maximized log-likelihood (since both have the same number of parameters).

The symmetry breaking mechanism is such that the lagrangian potential for weak fields corresponds to a negative mass squared particle. It is then possible to set up the hypotesis that the Higgs, just as the tachyon, is unobservable as a free particle. In other words, it is unable to occupy free asymptotic states.

Such a prescription is sure to explain the grand success of the classical theories and may also help get a deeper understanding and to lead to better designing of charged-particle beam devices.

Despite all this progress, there is still a need for developing new analysis tools that relate the network structure to its dynamics, especially ones that are applicable to large scale networks. This is a problem for many of the methods developed so far, since many of them are very computationally demanding and can only be exactly applied to networks of small to moderate size. The size of the networks is also a problem even in cases where mathematical theorems are available, because as the network increases in size, it is very likely that the conditions needed in the theorems become harder and harder to be fulfilled. These limitations call for methods that are as generally applicable as possible.

A second benefit of restricting our attention to detections, is that the maximum and marginalized flux normalizations are the same. Thus, it is only necessary to compute one set of quantities to address both the posterior probability density of a given set of parameters (the marginal value) and assess the quality of the fit via a χ2 and/or Bayesian analysis (the maximum value).

The theory of inflation, a period of quasi-exponential expansion of the universe very shortly after the big bang is now widely regard as part of the standard cosmological model. The predictions of the simplest inflationary models have passed increasingly stringent tests from observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), most recently by the Planck satellite. Remarkably, the apparently crazy idea that the formation of all structures in our universe such as galaxies were caused by quantum perturbations of the field driving inflation, does have strong observational evidence. Inflation therefore provides a mechanism to relate the smallest and largest scales in the universe.

Let us require that, just like ordinary SU(5), mirror SU(5) breaks down to SU(3)mc × U(1)mEM, where mc and mEM refer to mirror color and mirror electromagntism, respectively. Since the soft terms of the mirror sector are different from those of ordinary sector, this breaking occurs at different energy scales. Consider the case when mirror SU(5) breaks down at much lower energy than the ordinary GUT scale. The coupling constant of SU(5) runs faster than that of SU(3), so the mirror coupling constant is larger than that of ordinary SU(3)c at the point where mirror SU(5) breaks down. Hence, SU(3)mc becomes strong at the scale Λmc which is larger than ordinary ΛQCD. Assuming

Commonly used position-sensitive detectors include scintillation counters, solid-state detectors, proportional tubes, and multiwire proportional and drift chambers. These produce electrical signals which can be digitized and processed in real time or recorded for further analysis using high-speed digital computers. Specialized detectors less commonly used nowadays include the cloud chamber and bubble chamber, in which measurements are made continually as the particle traverses an extended gaseous or liquid medium, the spark chamber, and stacks of photographic emulsion. These detectors typically produce information on photographic film which must be processed optically, requiring scanning and measurement by trained personnel.

Thus, the number of inequivalent observable sector embeddings satisfying the CMM conditions is presumably six; we take CMM observable sector embeddings 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 9 as representatives of these six. This does not mean that only six models of this type exist. For each choice of the six inequivalent {VA , a1A , a3A } there will be many possible hidden sector embeddings {VB , a1B , a3B}, not all of which are equivalent. CMM have left the hidden sector embedding unspecified and the purpose of this paper is to enumerate the allowed ways (up to equivalences) of embedding the hidden sector.
It is a vital property of the larc-abc process that it leads to position localisation in appropriate circumstances. But this localisation can only occur relative to some other body. Therefore, the theory cannot produce any problem of there being a preferred reference frame. Likewise, the temporal constant Pt for the probability of a state reduction also belongs to a well-defined system: that to which the relevant larc cluster belongs, such as the molecule where the photon is absorbed, so again there is no need for a preferred reference frame. Taken altogether, larc theory should be as relativistic as quantum field theory itself.

The use of asteroseismology can significantly advance our understanding of stellar evolution, stellar-interior physics, and stellar populations (Chaplin & Miglio 2013). Nowhere will this be more powerful then when used to combine high-precision photometric observations with strong prior information on age, distance, and metallicity in clusters that span a wide range in mass, chemical composition, and evolutionary state. K2 observations of bright stars within clusters, e.g., O-B stars (Aerts et al., 2003, 2013; Degroote et al., 2010) or A and F pulsators (Michaud & Richer, 2013) can yield results on radiative levitation and element depletion processes, and the onset of near-surface convection, and allow comparisons of distance scales for various cluster stars using the standard pulsating variables such as RR Lyrae stars or Cepheids.
We observe that for Λd < 0 the cosmological constants of the universe and the dual universe obey the Dirac quantization. In fact, this kind of quantization is incorporated with the energy quantization.

We can then summarize the above discussion in the following form.
Functionality, coded in the deploy, start and terminate methods, is separated from configuration, coupling and deployment processes dealt with by SmartFrog. Adding components then consists in coding the corresponding classes. Building the blocks is done in the description where components are easily associated. Any new functionality translated into a new component is then highly configurable: fields of the Java class can be presented as attributes of the corresponding component in the description. References to other components in the tree can be included in order to be resolved at run-time, thus enabling the remote invocation of a method from the referenced component.

In every train-track all edges must be mapped to an edge-path that has alternately Type 2 edges (denoted by letters) and Type 1 edges (denoted by numbers). This ensures that two or more adjoining Type 2 edges do not collapse back to a shorter edge-path under repeated action of the braid. (This is the non-cancellation property alluded to above.) With no possibility of such cancellations a transition matrix can be written down by recording the number of edges in each edge-path. This matrix can then be used to determine the evolution of an arbitrary edge-path under any number of subsequent applications of the braid.

The point is that we are picking exactly one vertex from each vertex set/partition, and hence do not lose any randomness or independence of the edges. This now gives us a bound on the minimum number of edges one can expect, w.h.p., in the chosen set of k vertices. We are not able to express, in a closed form, the size of a subgraph obtainable using this algorithm for a specific density. Therefore, we state the best density one can guarantee w.h.p. for k = 2log n. This is stated as a theorem below, which we prove subsequently.
In short, the charge-self-consistency condition can on equal footing be understood as a way of improving the density functional of DFT to include more explicit correlation effects as well as finding a realistic and consistent effective single-particle part of DMFT via combining both formalisms to a new, complete cycle, which is summarized in the following sections.

Only the last two statements need an explanation. Since (ci , xi +1) is positive and (di , xi +1) is negative, (a, xi +1) must be negative for a preceding di, for otherwise, there are two sign changes in the sign sequence of {xi + 1}. The statement about (di, a) is proved in the same way.

The RPC has been tested with cosmic rays in a standard cosmic ray test set-up. We have used three plastic scintillators - two paddle scintillators (20 cm × 8.5 cm) and one finger scintillator (7 cm × 1.5 cm). The overlap area between the scintillators has been used to obtain the cosmic ray efficiency for a particular set-up.

The key features of the results obtained with the quantal Langevin model are the occurrence of larger fluctuations and an enhancement of stable configurations, such as bound fragments, as a result of the need to take account of the spectral distortion of the wave packets. The former feature arises from the fact that the wave packets are populated according to the strength of the eigencomponent for the given energy, and therefore the wave packet parameters can have larger fluctuations than when the expectation value of the energy is conserved. On the other hand, in order to project out the appropriate energy component from the wave packet, it is necessary to take account of its internal distortion. The combination of these two basic features is then expected to enhance the IMF yield at the final stage: while the larger fluctuations allow the system to explore more configurations and thus enhances the yield of primary fragments, the latter stabilizes the fragments, since the compensation for the quantum distortion effectively acts as a cooling mechanism.

Remark. In the previous lemma there is nothing about the case of equality. Indeed, it is possible that some columns are identical to the pivot column, but some other columns are identical except that the bottom entry is different. To prove that φ is a bijection it is important to notice that in any case, two differently-filled columns of T give rise to differently-filled columns in φ(T). An essential remark is that if there is in T a column with a single 1 in bottom position and 0s elsewhere, then it is necessarly identical to the pivot column, so that there is no confusion possible.

We consider probing the 11-dimensional solution with a giant graviton. In this case the giant graviton is a 2-brane wrapped on an S2 within the S4. We take the brane world-volume to be parameterized by the coordinates t, θ2 , φ2 and consider rigid motion in the φ1 direction at fixed θ1 . The motion in the non-compact AdS directions is arbitrary, but assumed to be independent of the coordinates θ2 , φ2 , so that only rigid motion of the brane is considered. The action for the giant graviton is given by
We further demonstrate how using several simple linear time tests can be used as a filtering step, and conjecture, based on experimental evidence, that these lead to expected O(n) time algorithms. But first the reader is kindly invited to try for herself.
Critical KS sets are sets of IDs as described above. Again, the IDs in a KS set need not be critical in the sense given for IDs, but instead the KS will be called critical if no subset of IDs and/or qubits can be removed from the set such that a smaller KS set remains. These critical KS sets are then the minimal structures in the N-qubit Pauli group that demonstrate quantum contextuality.

To be precise, we do three things. First, we proof that the identity holds for arbitrary 2D lattices with one site per unit cell using Fourier transformation. Second, we generalize the identity to situations where the origin does not coincide with a lattice site. Third, we rewrite the identity such that the form of the exponential factor is reminiscent of magnetic wave functions in uniaxial rather than symmetric gauge. The last result is particularly useful when the spin liquids are formulated on lattices with periodic boundary conditions.

Eq. (11) reduces the degrees of freedom from 16 to 12 because Eq. (11) is valid for each spinor indexes. So, Eq. (9) (or Eq.

(11) one comes to the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation for each component of the 4-vector-spinor

In summary, we have compared two methods of evolution for the structure functions: FOPT and DGLAP evolution. We found that for the polarized structure function g1p(x, Q2), the two methods give identical answers, even if the logarithms in the scale are large. For the unpolarized case, the two methods are not equivalent in the small x region of the singlet piece of F2p(x, Q2). For the non-singlet piece, however, there is no distinction between FOPT and DGLAP evolution, even for very large values of Q2. The results of this work question the connection between large logarithms in Q2 and the need for their resummation.
We have constructed a new model for the Universe with two key assumptions written in the preferred frame of cosmology: (i) inertial energy of the Universe, Mc2, is a constant, and (ii) the total energy of a particle, i.e., its inertial energy plus its gravitational potential energy, is zero. The second assumption is another version of the Machian view. In addition, we do not restrict the speed of light to a constant, however, we assume that G is a constant. These and some other plausible assumptions lead to the relations between the scale factor and the speed of light, the total mass and the density of the Universe. Also the relations between the wavelength and the frequency of light and the scale factor are obtained. This suggests that corrections to the redshift measurements should be made.
Currently, the HERA interaction regions are optimised for high luminosity running, with focussing magnets placed close to the interaction region. This sets a limit on the minimum measurable four-momentum transfer squared of about 4 GeV2. These high luminosities are essential for the measurement of small spin-induced asymmetries and also for high statistics eD measurements. At low Q2, event rates will be high and substantial upgrades of the front-end electronics may be required.

There are two principal categories of fusion techniques. Some algorithms make use of the score assigned to each document in each input result set to calculate a final score for that document in the fused result set. Because these raw scores are not always directly comparable (e.g. one input result set might assign scores in a range of 0-100 while another uses 0-1), score-based techniques frequently make use of a score normalisation phase before fusion takes place. This typically involves the mapping of all scores to a common range. Others make use of the rank each document occupies in each of the inputs, as the scores are not always available.
We have been able here to demonstrated that scale-invariance and a mean-value constraint are sufficient and necessary conditions for obtaining the LE from first dynamical principles. Then, the LE was generalized to multi-component systems. This allowed us to show that these dynamical mechanisms underlie interesting scale-free processes, which was illustrated with reference to city-populations phenomena, diffusion in complex networks, and popularity of Net Browsers.

The RS1 model is an interesting candidate in order to explain the well known hierarchy problem. It is formulated as two 4D surfaces (branes) in 5D world in which the extra dimension is compactified into S1/Z2 orbifold. In this model, the SM fields are assumed to live on one of the brane, so called the TeV brane. On the other hand, the gravity peaks near the other brane, so called the Planck brane and extends into the bulk with varying strength. Here, 5D cosmological constant is non vanishing and both branes have equal and opposite tensions so that the low energy effective theory has flat 4D spacetime. The metric of such 5D world reads

In the context of the above theorem we say that observables E1 and E2 are regularly coexistent. We may then say that regularly coexistent observables are functionally coexistent.
In the regression RNNs, we used an LSTM layer of size 100. We did not observe a benefit in using more LSTM units. We used the part of the gradient corresponding to all 30,300 weights of the output layer (including one bias per word2Vec dimension). In the case of the larger COCO dataset, due to the computational burden of the CCA calculation, we used PCA to reduce the gradient dimension from 30,300 to 20,000. PCA was calculated on a random subset of 300,000 sentences (around 50%) of the training set. We also tried PCA dimension reduction to a lower dimension of 4,096, for all three datasets. We observed no change in performance (Flickr8K) or slightly worse results (Flickr30K and COCO).
Because the set covering problem included a set for each pair of xi points, there exists some yj that covers both xi and xa. By the previous argument, that yj is set to 0 in all assignments that set xi or xa = 0. For a fixed k, all of these points can be covered by the implicate zk → yj. Hence, points p and q are not independent.

Now we proceed to present the detailed theoretical modeling of interaction between photonic pulses and an atom inside a two-sided cavity. This calculation serves for two purposes; first, we need to prove the statements made before for the principle of the CSWAP gate. In particular, we will show that the pulse will have reflection or transmission conditional on the atomic state if its bandwidth is much smaller than the coupling rates κ and g2/κ. Second, we also want to characterize the influence of noise on this gate scheme. The most important noise here is the intrinsic atomic spontaneous emission, which causes loss of photons to uncontrolled directions. There could be other source of noise, such as the light absorption/scattering at the cavity mirrors. The effect of the latter, however, is very similar to the atomic spontaneous emission and thus can be similarly modeled.
The Linking Number
In conclusion, we showed that unconventional triplet superconductivity is generally possible in TI quantum wells proximate to a conventional superconductor. It involves triplet condensation at finite momenta under the influence of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, likely leading to a vortex lattice state. Quantum melting of such a vortex lattice is tunable by the gate voltage and expected to yield a correlated triplet insulator, a vortex liquid that could exhibit topological order and excitations with fractional statistics. We argued that singlet superconductivity, also possible in the TI quantum well, need not be an obstacle to obtaining the superconducting and correlated insulating phases of triplets.

Introduction
The purpose of the study is to employ molecular dynamics simulations to determine the binding affinities between E2 and ERs of the different isoforms in the rainbow trout and to use the results to provide insight into the underlying evolutionary selection pressure on the ERs. Our binding affinity results obtained from insertion and deletion are very similar indicating that our simulations are well converged and that accurate estimates of binding affinities were obtained. Our results show that E2 binds preferentially to ERα1 over ERα2. By contrast, the difference in binding affinity is less significant for the β subtype, i.e., both isoforms bind similarly to E2. We also computed dN/dS ratios for the ER isoforms. These results suggest that the ERα1 gene is evolving under relaxed selection compared to all other salmonid ERα genes.

The modifications proposed to CUS method aims at providing a more perceptual assessment of the quality of the automatic video summaries. Instead of comparing frames from different summaries using color features only as in CUS method, both color and texture features (as in section 3.2 and section 3.3) are used to detect the similarity of the frames. Once two frames are color-based similar or texture-based similar, they are excluded from the next iteration of the comparison process. In this modified CUS version, the Bhattacharya distance is used to detect both color and texture similarity; in this case the distance threshold value for color and texture similarity is set to 0.97.

During an inflationary epoch, quantum fluctuations swept up in the rapid expansion lead to perturbations in the present universe. A review of this mechanism, and of the modelling of an inflationary epoch, is given in Ref. 6. Inflation produces not only a spectrum of density perturbations, but also one of gravitational waves. These latter are capable of influencing large-angle microwave background anisotropies, as witnessed by the COBE satellite, and must be taken into account in a full comparison with observations.
was applied to the Dopplergrams to enhance the p-mode oscillations above the other features. The temporal power spectrum was obtained for each pixel. This spectrum was smoothed by applying a digital filter, namely a Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter (Press et al., 1992), to the power spectrum. This filter basically smooths the data by a window function of a predefined number of data points and a polynomial order with a proper weighting and then finds the maximum of the smoothed spectrum. We observe an optimal fit with a window of 32 data points and a polynomial of order 6. The peak frequency of the smoothed spectrum was then determined by selecting the discrete frequency in the appropriate frequency domain whose ordinate was greatest in the smoothed spectrum.

Results and Assessments
Results obtained by the Bayesian model are quantitatively evaluated by the above criterion. It is, however, possible that a false long-term trend would be extracted from observations even the result satisfies the above criterion. Hence, results from the Bayesian model should be evaluated carefully. In addition to the above criterion, we can check the validity of results with their qualitative features. We expect that a long-term trend exhibits not a random walk, but a systematic motion in the QU plane. A long-term trend depicting a very complicated path in the QU plane may merely indicate that there is no systematic long-term trend in the observed QU. We should also suspect a result highly sensitive to a small change in w.

Complementary imaging of the GAMA regions is being obtained by a number of independent survey programmes including GALEX MIS, VST KiDS, VISTA VIKING, WISE, Herschel-ATLAS, GMRT and ASKAP providing UV to radio coverage. GAMA is funded by the STFC (UK), the ARC (Australia), the AAO, and the participating institutions. The GAMA website is http://www.gama-survey.org/.
The Distributed Data Analysis Manager never itself actually manipulates the data; rather, it issues instructions to the other units that include where to expect data from and where to send results to. The other units (the data archives, the data conditioning unit, the filters and the event manager) then negotiate their own connections and perform the analysis as instructed.

Introduction
The gas accreted onto compact objects in close binary systems is transferred via Roche-lobe overflow by a main-sequence or sub-giant companion. The large specific angular momentum of the gas naturally leads to the conclusion that a thin accretion disk forms in the system (the gas being allowed to radiatively lose energy much more efficiently than momentum when cooling is efficient; see, e.g., Frank, King & Raine 1992 for a review). The presence of thin accretion disks during outburst in transient close binaries has been observationally confirmed by detailed eclipse maps in DN (Horne 1993) and X-ray spectroscopic diagnostics in SXTs (Tanaka & Shibazaki 1996). The situation in quiescence appears more complicated, however.

It is also important to stress how the end of inflation and reheating happens here. Actually there is no clear distinction between inflation and reheating, since radiation is produced continuously and its energy density stays roughly constant in time. The crucial difference is only that during inflation the potential energy dominates. We can find the field value φRH and also the temperature TRH at reheating just equating by definition the potential to the radiation energy density ρRH:
An error of 0.87% on MNIST is probably (at this time) state-of-the-art for the above learning setting. The only difference between softmax and DLSVM is the last layer. This experiment is mainly to demonstrate the effectiveness of the last linear SVM layer vs. the softmax, we have not exhaustively explored other commonly used tricks such as Dropout, weight constraints, hidden unit sparsity, adding more hidden layers and increasing the layer size.
The transmission of signals at a superluminal speed is in contradiction to the relativistic causality. This telecommunication system that could transmit information at superluminal speeds is based on the polarization entangled photon pairs, therefore the existence of the polarization entangled photon pairs is in direct contradiction to the relativistic causality.

Many current and planned synoptic sky surveys image the same areas of sky repeatedly over many years. With the ability to directly measure position angle, separation and contrast ratio of individual binaries, in many cases sufficient data will be collected to follow the motion of binary systems with time. Since this can be done over large areas and very large samples, BinaryFinder could be used to obtain orbital measurements (and thus mass constraints) for a very large sample of binaries.

If the wave power in the inertial range is much higher than assumed here, other nonlinear couplings might play a role also in the kinetic regime. This can possibly destroy the normal mode superposition even above k = 1, and then lead to a completely different picture with respect to both the spectral transfer to higher wavenumbers and the dispersion structure in the dispersive spectral range.

This procedure exploits the morphological regularity that parts of composite words exist as simple forms. If both, the complex form and a simpler one which is part of it, are members of the list of word forms, the complex form is divided into the simple one and the remaining character string (which has to respect the linguistic parameters). According to language specific properties, several cycles of splitting complex character strings into simple ones are necessary for German word forms whereas only a few are needed for English ones.

Summarizing, it is possible to say that the main mesoscopic deformation mechanisms which take place during the BET on an unbalanced fabric have been isolated. These significant contributions include the in-plane shear of the yarns, the differential local bending of the yarns and the sliding of the yarns. In the next section a macroscopic, second-gradient, continuum model which is able to capture such mesoscopic deformation mechanisms together with their macroscopic counterpart will be introduced. This model will provide a sensible description of the macroscopic S-shaped deformation of the considered unbalanced fabric, as well as a reasonable prediction of the mesoscopic deformation of the yarns.

Our future work will apply probFuse to larger collections with greater levels of incompleteness in their available relevance judgments (e.g. the Web track collections of later TREC conferences). We intend to investigate whether the performance of probFuseJudged and probFuseAll diverges as the level of incompleteness increases. In addition, the relevance judgments for some collections differentiate between different degrees of relevance (e.g. for the WT10G collection, documents can be judged nonrelevant, relevant and highly relevant). We also intend to investigate whether adjustments to our probability calculations that take this information into account will be beneficial.

Dragging solitons: forward lubricant motion
After discussing the unicast case, we extend our result to more general traffic models. We show that for multiple-access (multiple sources communicating to the same destination node) and broadcast (a single source node communicating independent information to multiple destinations) traffic, each rate point in the capacity region of the original network can be approximately achieved by using an acyclic directed subnetwork. However, a single acyclic directed subnetwork that allows to approximately achieve all the rate points in the original capacity region may not exist. For multicast (a single source node communicates the same information to multiple destinations) and multiple unicast (multiple source-destination pairs communicating independent information with each other) traffic, we provide examples which illustrate that bidirected communication over certain links can be critical to achieving capacity. These results provide a generalization of the conclusions for the single-hop case, where it is known that the capacity gain from feedback is bounded (or absent) for point-to-point, multiple-access and broadcast Gaussian channels and can be unbounded in the case of interference channels.

We discuss general black brane system with arbitrary number of species of branes. We can also introduce momentum along one of the cycles of the torus if all the branes wind around this cycle. (We define R as the radius of this cycle.) In this case, the momentum is quantized as NP/R and there are NP gravitational waves each of which carries a momentum 1/R. We can regard this gravitational wave as a 0-brane with mass 1/R via the KK reduction of this cycle. Although the setup is complicated, we will see a simple result that the effective theory of the separated intersecting branes explains the black hole thermodynamics of the corresponding black brane at low energy.

We have showed predictions for direct photon production process in association with a heavy quark jet. Based on the discrepancy between data and theory at NLO at the Tevatron, we focused on the case of a charm jet because the charm intrinsic contribution is less suppressed in comparison to a possible bottom quark intrinsic contribution. We have shown that using the studied process, one can test models of intrinsic charm such as the BPHS model which modify the charm PDF at large x beyond the reach of DIS measurements.

The averaging time for the solutions ranged from 1 to 20 minutes with a solution made for EACH frequency channel, or for ALL frequency channels combined for better sensitivity. In all cases the resultant in-beam source looked point-like and its peak flux density was approximately equal to the expected solution noise per averaging time. In other words the phase determination algorithm does produce a point source even with noise data. However, when this phase calibration is transferred to the pulsar and images are made, the peak flux density and the quality of the pulsar images indicate the accuracy of the phase calibration. The solutions with at least five minutes solution time, with all frequencies added together, produced good pulsar images. The slight decrease in pulsar peak flux from 5-min integration to 20-min integration may be caused by loss of coherence over this relatively long period of time. The images in which all frequencies have been averaged with a solution interval of 5, 10 or 20 minutes are acceptable and do not differ in the location of the peak (See Table 2).

In conclusion, we have studied the behavior of quasi bound states in a bi-ripple waveguide as the distance between the two ripple cavities changes. We found that the widths and positions of the resonances associated with the quasi bound state poles change in a sinusoidal way with variation of the distance between the ripple cavities. In 2D and 3D models of the Dicke effect, the coupling parameter decays when the distance between two atoms (impurities or quantum dots) is longer than the wavelength of photon or electron. In the ripple waveguide system, the coupling parameter does not decay because the waveguide is a quasi 1-D system. We also studied the trajectories of S-matrix poles in the complex energy plane. We found that the pair of poles that give rise to the super- and subradiant resonances in the electron transmission, rotate on a circle centered on the S-matrix pole for the waveguide with a single cavity and are phase shifted by π. Therefore, superradiant and subradiant resonances appear in oscillatory manner as the distance between cavities is changed. Furthermore, as the S-matrix poles rotate, the symmetry of the electron state associated with the superradiant (subradiant) resonance alternates between symmetric and anti-symmetric with increasing distance between the two ripple cavities.
The second problem that we face by applying the algorithm is the presence of the activity, A(t), relating the observed signal, x(t), to the signal of interest, γ(t). In the following analysis we will assume that the activity is a deterministic function of time with a daily period. One would naturally expect it to also have a weekly variation along with a variation on slower time scales, but here we will be interested in time scales below the resolution of a day, why it makes sense to approximate the activity by a daily period.

The customary three-star photometry reduction scheme cannot be applied, since the stray light is distributed very inhomogeneously on the CCD chip. The mean background value, which is subtracted on-board, is not stored due to downlink limitations; hence the true raw data cannot be reconstructed. To improve the accuracy of the data, it is possible to use the decorrelation technique, as done by the previously mentioned data reduction techniques. Here constant comparison stars are used instead of background pixels, whose individual values are not available.

Similarly to other lower bounds on quantum algorithms, this result should not be considered as pessimistic. First, the classical binary search is very sequential algorithm and, therefore, it is not so surprising that it is impossible to speed it up by using quantum algorithms. Second, the classical binary search is already fast enough for most (if not all) practical purposes.

The standard way of measuring perceived quality is by conducting subjective tests where the end user is asked to rate the system as a whole or rate individual system components on a continuous or discrete scale. However defining service quality by conducting subjective tests is resource intensive and not feasible in real-time communications. This raises the question if we can measure or estimate perceived quality automatically with acceptable resource requirements and high accuracy. To answer this question, we need a reference point, in the form of databases of audiovisual material at several quality levels to enable us to develop models for accurate quality estimation. However audiovisual testing is a topic still relatively under-explored and the number of existing databases of various configurations is very limited. In this research, we present a database of audiovisual material with subjective scores for a wide range of audiovisual quality parameters as one of our contributions.
QED and QCD are the cornerstones for a grand synthesis known as the standard model. The standard model has successfully accounted for every particle experiment carried out to date. However, for many physicists the standard model is inadequate because data on the masses, charges and other properties of the fundamental particles need to be found from experiments. An ideal theory would predict all of these.

SUMMARY
The combination of the BH and FT strategies appears to be constructive: The conditions (i) and (ii) are satisfied. In Table 6, we give values of the mixing parameter α, the return R3, and the dispersion of the combined strategy with the lowest possible dispersion. The minimum of the dispersion is not an obligatory requirement. The value of α is selected as a compromise between the highest possible return and the minimum possible risk. The above estimates show the limits within which these parameters (return and dispersion) can be changed.

ABSTRACT
We consider the point cloud captured by the Velodyne 64E lidar. Like other range scan data, points from a Velodyne scan can be roughly projected and discretized into a 2D point map, using the following projection function.
The present study has several fundamental limitations. First, the dynamics of swarms were explored only through a limited number of random parameter sampling and analyzed only using simple median comparisons. It was a reasonable first step of exploration when nothing was known about the model, but this approach would not be able to characterize behavioral diversity and richness of each class of systems or to discover non-trivial behaviors that would be statistically rare but unique and interesting. To fully explore and understand the limit of dynamical diversity of each class, more sophisticated evolutionary or other population-based search methods should be conducted. Now that we have 24 outcome metrics defined, we can try evolving morphogenetic collective systems toward a certain area in this metric space, to examine how closely the swarms of each class can achieve the target properties.

To characterize the macroscopic mechanical response of the woven composite reinforcements, two set of experimental tests are proposed. Indeed, the behavior of such materials must be analyzed under different types of loads and, in particular, the most important feature to be determined is the in-plane shear response of the woven composite. In fact, due to the quasi-inextensibility of the fibers, the main deformation mode of the woven composites reinforcements during a forming process is the in-plane shear deformation (angle variation between the warp and weft).

In cross-layer dynamic route selection data is transmitted between source-destination pairs through dynamic routes. This is in contrast to static routing where a fixed multihop link is established between source-destination pairs. The proposed cross-layer dynamic route selection schemes at the MAC layer schedule the assignment of relays in different hops based on the associated channel and buffer conditions. As we shall demonstrate, the proposed schemes enhance the overall throughput of the network and help meet the diverse QoS requirements.

Inertia
We have shown how nuclear quantum effects give rise to large qualitative and quantitative changes in the local hydrogen bonded structure of water, such as the appearance of transient proton excursions to nearby oxygen nuclei. Accompanying these hydrogen bond rearrangements are changes in the underlying electronic structure, which in turn modulate the nuclear motion and the quantum kinetic energy of the nuclei. These effects manifest as isotope effects and can be understood and validated by experimental probes of the quantum kinetic energy. Our simulations, incorporating both nuclear and electronic quantum effects, have shown that the transient proton excursions are overestimated in GGA DFT functionals, where their tendency to delocalize electron density leads to excess delocalization of the nuclei, a problem that is exacerbated upon including nuclear quantum effects. While BLYP manages to qualitatively capture the cancellation between competing quantum effects, PBE over-estimates dramatically the extent of quantum fluctuations of the proton and incorrectly predicts inverse fractionation at room temperature.

In all models of particle acceleration to extreme energies, the flux decreases with energy. The decreasing flux is not fully compensated by an increasing sensitivity of the neutrino detector. This leads to a strategy that concentrates on somewhat lower energy neutrinos, acting as surrogates for the extremely energetic, but far rarer, cosmic rays.
Suppose Player a is making an announcement α for a set of components Tα. Since Player c should not learn about a single card other than his own hand, we get the following lemma.
This holds for special relativity as well as for general relativity. Special relativity shares with Newtonian mechanics one crucial point: inertial coordinates are distinguished from all others (i.e. from non-inertial reference frames), and the laws of physics are said to hold only relative to inertial coordinate systems. It is often argued that general relativity puts away any worries over inertial reference frames insofar as it nullifies the privileged status of inertial reference frames. Inertial and uniformly accelerated motions are equivalent. However, the statement that all reference frames, rather than just inertial frames, are equivalent is misleading. Rather, the variable curvature of space-time makes the imposition of a global inertial frame impossible. Any space-time obeying the general theory of relativity and thus accounting for gravitation will be locally Minkowskian in the sense that any infinitesimal region of space-time has an inertial frame obeying the principles of special relativity.

An alternative procedure to take the electronic correlations into account, used in band structure calculations of strongly correlated transition metal oxides, is to incorporate the atomic Hubbard U directly in a LDA+U scheme. For molecular crystals, however, this approach would require a novel computational scheme that uses a basis set of orthonormal molecular orbitals so that a molecular U can be incorporated.

Introduction
Though the CC approximation is better than the CS approximation, but it is too expensive from the computation point of view. A calculations in the CC approximation takes many times more computer time as compared to that in the CS approximation. In a large number of calculations, the CS and CC approximations have been used. Some of the papers where such calculations have been done are: Cernicharo et al. (2011), Daniel et al. (2014; 2015), Dubernet et al. (2006), Dumouchel et al.

We find that the cross-section for J/ψ production is completely dominated by the gluon fragmentation contribution (shown by the dotted line in Fig. 2) and is larger than the fusion contribution and the charm-quark fragmentation contribution by two orders of magnitude. The cross-section for J/ψ production is large and even at pT = 100 GeV, the cross-section is as large as 0.1 pb. For values of pT so much larger than the charm quark mass, the fragmentation picture becomes exact and the experimental measurement of the J/ψ cross-section will, therefore, be a crucial test of the fragmentation picture. The LHC measurement will also be a test of the magnitude of the colour-octet contributions.

The original focus of the SKA was observations of the 21-cm H I line from galaxies, and such observations remain a significant focus of the SKA Key Science Program. Neutral hydrogen is the raw material from which stars form. The peak of the star formation rate in the Universe occurred at redshifts between about 1 to 2 (e.g. Madau et al. 1996; Steidel et al. 1999; Hopkins and Beacom 2006). The SKA will be able to probe the evolution of neutral hydrogen to this crucial point in the assembly of galaxies.

It is striking (Figure 2) how tight the Chi distribution fits to the distances histograms. We believe that this might be an important observation, in general, for the use of SIFT features, beyond nearest-duplicate detection. Our results demonstrate that the benefits of the well-adjusted model can be quite dramatic, as the much better adjustment between expected (header) and observed (3rd line for Gaussian, 5th line for Chi) accuracies on Table 1 show.
Motivated by the work of Geroch on asymptotically flat spacetimes, conformal transformations were used not only to give a well-defined derivative on null hypersurfaces, but also to provide a test to determine whether the null surface admits such a definition.
Now we turn to discussion of more realistic situation, when many pair interaction scatterers are present in the sample. It is worth noting that in our mean-field treatment we neglect OP phase, which is a strongly fluctuating quantity in short coherence length high-Tc superconductors and, especially, in the inhomogeneous situation. In the present paper we only study local pairing and do not concern the global transition temperature Tc, which is controlled by the phase fluctuations.

Posttest. At the 95 % confidence level, or α = 0.05, we find that p = 0.087 > α, so there is no significant difference between the means of the posttest scores of males (x̄m, post = 67 %) and females (x̄f, post = 58 %). Though the percent difference between the means may not be ignored at 15 % (only 1 % away from that of the pretest), the relatively wide variation of student scores (as measured by the standard deviation) results to acceptance of the null hypothesis in the t-test.
Thus if we are to look for new fifth force, search must not be directed at long range but to short range and it will have to be a non-abelian vector or a scalar field.

Several works have pointed out the importance of the study of YSGs in galaxies and, in particular, of the study of the relations between properties of the YSGs and global properties of the mother galaxy. These relations are important for deducing properties of the physical mechanism of star formation and, possibly, as indirect distance estimates. Examples of such correlations found in the literature are the scaling laws between the largest YSG in a galaxy and the size of the galaxy itself (Elmegreen et al. 1994, 1996), or the relationship between the total B magnitude and color indices of the galaxy and the luminosity of the greatest YSG (Wray et al. 1980). To check these laws and to deducing new interesting relations, we have developed an automatic method for the identification of the YSGs in unresolved galaxies. The method is based on a multivariate statistical analysis (Adanti et al. 1994, Battinelli et al. 2000).
In examples of section 3 we have used this restriction without any special mention of it.

(ii) From the requirement of constancy of the Compton wavelength of a hadron the density of the vacuum energy within the sphere surrounding quarks may be estimated. (iii) The inward force acting on quarks due to negative vacuum is strong enough to confine them within hadron. (iv) Quarks occurring around the center of the sphere of the negative vacuum energy behave as practically free particles. (v) Hadrons appear as islands of quarks surrounded by negative vacuum energy in a sea of the positive vacuum energy given by the common cosmological constant.

Distinguishing between a transient and a persistent problem matters because a good ABR may adapt to temporary problems (e.g., lowering bitrate), but it cannot avoid bad quality caused by persistent problems (e.g., when a peering point is heavily congested, even the lowest bitrate may see re-buffering). Instead, persistent problems require corrective actions taken by the video provider (e.g., placement of new PoPs closer to client) or ISPs (e.g., additional peering).
The possibility that accretion disks play a role in PNe formation was first suggested by Morris (1987). More recently Soker & Livio (1994) and Reyes-Ruiz & Lopez (these proceedings) have explored the formation of disks in binary PNe systems in more detail. In these works there has been a tacit assumption that disk = outflows. Obviously there is gap in the theory and it remains unclear if or how accretion disks in PNe can create collimated outflows that match observations. I now review two classes of disk wind models that may be applicable for PNe.

To conclude we have studied experimentally the statistical properties of the energy exchanged between two heat baths at different temperature which are coupled by electric thermal noise. We have measured the heat flux, the entropy production rate and we have shown the existence of a conservation law for entropy which imposes the existence of a fluctuation theorem which is not asymptotic in time. Our results, which are theoretically proved, are very general since the electric system considered here is ruled by the same equations as for two Brownian particles, held at different temperatures and mechanically coupled. Therefore these results set precise constraints on the energy exchanged between coupled nano and micro-systems held at different temperatures. We finally mention that for the quantity Wi an asymptotic fluctuation theorem can be proved both experimentally and theoretically, and this will be the subject of a paper in preparation.

For all of the listed surveys, there is a convenient interface to request the fits files.

Analysis
Summing up the discussion we state the following. The results obtained by studying PT symmetric optical lattices as well as those received from an investigation of open quantum systems show the characteristic features of non-Hermitian quantum physics. They prove environmentally induced effects that cannot be described convincingly in conventional Hermitian quantum physics. Due to the reduced phase rigidity around an EP, the system is able to align (at least partly) with the environment. This can be seen from PT symmetry breaking occurring in one of the considered systems as well as from the dynamical phase transition taking place at high level density in the other system.

Graphical representations of graphic frame matroids
We investigate hyperon and antihyperon production in Pb+Pb collision at CERN SPS energies using two different scenarios. The formation of a Constituent Quark Plasma and the modeling of its hadronization as in the ALCOR and MICOR models was used to calculate the particle numbers and transverse momentum distributions. String formation and fragmentation as in the HIJING/B with ropes model was also used to calculate particle yields. In the case of meson, baryon and non-strange antibaryon yields, both models predict similar particle numbers. However, only the CQP scenario could reproduce the antihyperon data. This can be attributed to the coalescence of heavier strange quarks which is favoured in the ALCOR model. The inability of HIJING/B to reproduce the antihyperon data reveals the need for a new hadronic mechanisms (similar to the baryon junction) for antihyperon production.

Even with proper POS tagging, morphological disambiguation, and chunking, we are still faced with the problem of negative evidence; without a very large corpus, we cannot say with confidence that a given verb cannot appear with certain arguments, simply because it has not yet been observed with those arguments.

We could imagine a system that generates sentences to test the hypothesis that a given verb may be used with a given subcategorization frame, then presents those sentences to human users for grammaticality judgments.

Summary and Discussion
The predictive distributions of R1, R2, G, L, and A are derived from past data and elicited information. They are treated as independent in order to derive a joint distribution. The predictive distribution of A depends on the number of offers, O, and is modeled as Binomial (O, π), where π is estimated from historical data. The predictive distribution of R1 is obtained by polling departmental faculty to elicit from each of them a predictive distribution of the number of research assistantships they will have available in the next academic year. The distribution of R1 is then the distribution of the sum of the numbers from faculty, obtained by convolving the elicited distributions. The predictive distributions of R2 and L are based on historical data on these quantities; empirical rather than model-based distributions are used. The predictive distribution of G is based on current information about student progress and is typically quite tight.
We also show the stability of integrals along fibers for some 2-dimensional cases.
Basically, the language designer using an LDA picks suitable language building blocks from the language knowledge base (language library), customizes them, and composes them into larger and larger language fragments. It may be necessary to add entirely new building blocks and concepts in the process, especially domain-specific ones, since it cannot be expected that everything required is already present in customizable form. The LDA provides feedback during customization and composition. Finally, the finished design is implemented by a language development system that serves as back-end to the LDA.
A common problem in computational physics is computing the eigenpairs of large matrices. We will present a new Monte Carlo algorithm that allows the simultaneous determination of a few extremal eigenpairs of a very large matrix without the need to orthogonalize pairs of vectors to each other or store all the components of any vector.
The efficiency of string matching algorithms depends on the underlying automaton used for recognizing the pattern p and on the encoding used for simulating it. Here we present the list of all string matching algorithms based on deterministic automata.

The outcome of these instructions is a sequence of random strings, all of them in order of length. Suppose the length of this new program is L symbols, this program will eventually print a random string of L + 1 symbols. But then we have just printed a random sequence of L + 1 symbols with less than L + 1 symbols! This contradicts the definition of algorithmic randomness, therefore there cannot exist an algorithm that can decide the randomness of a string.

Damping Tail and Lensing. Recombination is not instantaneous (takes about 1% of the age of the universe at the time of recombination) and hence, as recombination proceeds, photons are able to random-walk and erase anisotropy. The damping length for this erasure is set by the width of the recombination surface which is O(Mpc). The end result is that the primary CMB signal (i.e., that produced at the recombination surface) is damped for multipoles larger than about 1000 (or angles smaller than about 10 arcminutes).
Our null result for the gender aspect of polarisation and FCI as a whole may require no justification at all. However, in view of the existing evidences to the contrary for the FCI as a whole (see our references), it might be worth mentioning that our student participants were female-dominated and multi-racial in nature (international students). How these factors might have possibly influenced our result remains to be investigated.
I think the answer to these problems is to build a system which exploits the breadth of mathematics, by allowing quicker students to work through the material in greater depth and to take excursions into related topics, before racing ahead of their age group.

3.3 Expected performance and scalability
We now explore the current structures obtained by perturbing, non-linearly, a fully 3D equilibrium field. Of particular interest is the extent to which the results of the line-tied X-point model of Section 2 can be applied to more general 3D magnetic nulls. An exact equivalence cannot be expected since, in the absence of a true magnetic null, all points in the QSL field considered above are causally related. We present only a preliminary study here, but point out that the competition between localized interior currents and the footpoint currents, so apparent in the previous analysis, is also a salient feature in the model outlined below. For the cases considered however, the current at the null is always ultimately dominant.
Choice of x
So far we have not taken into account the physical effects of the ln z cut in the currents. At first sight, the presence of ln z in the currents appears to be contrary to the periodicity requirement of closed strings. However, this is not true. The periodicity requirement arises as a boundary condition in the process of minimizing the action. In other words only on mass shell physical string configurations are required to be periodic. In the presence of the extra zero mode the Hilbert space is larger. One must require periodicity in the physical on shell sector. The physical sector is identified as the subspace of states for which the matrix elements of the currents are periodic.

When the procedure applied to the nearby clusters is applied to a sample of intermediate-redshifts cluster, as the CNOC1 survey, an orbital-segregation is again detected. However, this time the differences is between the bulge-dominated galaxies and the disk-dominated galaxies, and the orbital-segregation is less strong than in the nearby sample. Moreover, when the orbits of the red and blue galaxies of the intermediate-redshift sample are compared the strongest orbital segregation is found. This result suggests the orbital segregation seems to modify more efficiently the star formation activity than the internal shape of the galaxies.

with, again, the primes restricted mod 8 as with f2(α; N). Note R2(n) is a weighted counting of the number of representations of n as a sum of two primes congruent to 3 or 5 modulo 8. Clearly if R2(n) > 0 then there must be at least one representation of n having the desired properties. Further, from our choice of c1 we see every representation of n is counted if n is of size N + o(N); if n is much larger, we are only counting the representations with each prime factor at most c1N and could therefore miss some.

Our next goal was to extract the CW signal from the PM time series, removing all the regular (periodic and quasi-periodic) and non-regular (trend) PM components out of the CW frequency band. Using digital filtering enables us to cut off the PM variations with periods beyond the CW band without application of any models of annual, trend, and other signals. The following two methods were used for digital filtering of the PM series.
Of course, our toy model relies on many simplifying assumptions. A full path integral description would include infinitely many paths with phases close to θi in the neighbourhood of each Pi, and infinitely many more exotic paths that are not piecewise linear and have rapidly fluctuating phases. Moreover, even in 1 + 1 dimensions, these paths are not geometrically related in a way that allows the sort of one dimensional representation that our toy model and choice of distance function assume. Nor is it evident which choice of distance function one should make for the full set of quantum paths, even for a single particle travelling between two specified points in space-time. These issues clearly ultimately need to be addressed, and we discuss some of them further below. Our present aim, though, is to extract intuitions from and explore the range of possibilities suggested by discrete toy models. We consider next ways of modelling multi-particle systems, beginning by considering models of interferometry experiments that include the measuring apparatus as well as the interfering particle.

The final mass diagram has very similar structure to the luminosity diagram and again reflects how mass loss is more severe in the high-metallicity region and drops off at low metallicity. The mass ejected by the SNe is also interesting because it demonstrates that a WR star ejects very little mass because it is more dense and so more tightly bound than a red giant progenitor.

As a result of the arguments in the earlier sections, we can construct a model where the composites can scatter from each other, whereas the process whose sole result is the scattering of the constituent spinor fields from each other vanish as the cut-off is removed. The scattering of the composite fields from each other will be a finite expression. There is also a tree-diagram process where the spinor scatters from a composite particle, a Compton-like scattering, with a finite cross-section. This diagram can be written in the other channel, which can be interpreted as spinor production out of vector particles. There are also processes where a single spinor scatters with a vector composite and creating additional vector particles in the tree approximation. Here we have to exclude any internal vector lines as a rule, which makes us use tree diagrams only. There may be insertions to vacuum fluctuations of a spinor field, but these just add finite contributions to the propagator, since the presence of vector propagators make these loop diagrams at most finite. Whenever the composites do not take part as incoming or outgoing particles, the cross section goes to zero.

This will, primary, require modification of the bases used in reconstruction since different parts of the frequency domain has to be covered, in comparison to the Lambertian case.

Such a scheme is useful for secure transmission of information over parallel channels. Suppose the transmitter and receiver share secret identifications. The transmitter can then divide the identification into pieces and recursively encode it into the shares of the message to be sent over parallel lines. Transmission of shares over parallel channels provided implicit security and reliability. Further, the scheme may be used for information dispersal in storage networks.

Because the thicknesses of these contamination layers are presumed to be much thinner (< 10 nm) than the dimensions of the constitutive elements of the qubit metallization, the constraints on the domain discretization necessary to produce a credible numerical solution made conventional simulation impractial. Instead we adopted a strategy of calculating the effective electric field strength at key interfaces by first assuming no contamination layer and extrapolating the solution to a different dielectric constant than those on either side of the original interface. The effective fields were calculated by matching the appropriate components of the electric fields as prescribed by the boundary conditions between two dielectric layers:

The theoretical mass distribution expected for groups and clusters in the hierarchical clustering scenario has been derived by several authors (see, e.g., Press & Schechter 1974; Cavaliere, Colafrancesco, & Scaramella 1991; Blanchard, Valls-Gabaud, & Mamon 1992). The distribution functions for mass, X-ray temperature and velocity dispersion of rich clusters have been shown to provide important diagnostics for cosmological models (see, e.g., Edge et al. 1990, Henry & Arnaud 1991, Lilje 1992). In particular, the distribution function of cluster X-ray temperatures has been used to constrain the mass fluctuation spectrum (see, e.g., Henry & Arnaud 1991). Bahcall (1979) estimated the cluster luminosity function, and first offered the possibility of evaluating the cluster mass function by adopting a constant mass-to-light ratio. At present both optical and X-ray data contribute to the description of the cluster mass function (Bahcall & Cen 1992). Recently, Pisani et al. (1992) obtained the mass distribution function of groups of galaxies directly from their dynamics, while Ashman, Persic, & Salucci (1993) described a distribution function of galaxy masses.

Introduction
The basic mathematics of calculus could be developed by scientists themselves (ie. Newton and Leibniz) as fortunately it did not necessarily require a too sophisticated pre-existing mathematical framework. Their work was simplified by the fact that the foundations of calculus had already been laid by earlier mathematicians. It was not just for nothing that Newton had stated that he had risen on the shoulders of giants.
In leading logarithmic approximation this ratio can be written as
Introduction
That the Perelman invariant of Xk is infinite follows from the fact that this is so for S2 × S2.
The central piece of OPE is the only one that contributes to scattering in spin-singlet waves. Like the Coulomb potential, this has a 1/r singularity, and so it does not alter the power-law forms of the wave functions at small r. The scattering in singlet waves with L ≥ 1 is weak, and so the corresponding effective potential can be expanded using naive dimensional analysis. In contrast, the 1S0 channel has a low-energy virtual state and so the expansion of its short-range potential is like the one around the unitary fixed point.
An important difference to the watershed algorithms used for image segmentation lies in the computational cost for checking all neighbours of a cell/pixel. Working in 3D naturally increases the number of neighbours. Using an AMR grid further increases the number of possible neighbours since one has to consider possible neighbours at the same level as the original cell as well as one level above and below. Most importantly, the data structure in an AMR grid is very different from the one of a flat 2D array. The location of neighbouring cells in memory needs to be constructed before a neighbour can be checked for its density. Our main interest lies therefore in reducing the number of neighbours that have to be accessed. This aspect influences the choice of watershed algorithm for our purpose.

The results show that the organic linkers sensibly deform the otherwise spherically symmetric Mn electron cloud. Magnetization curves reveal that the Mn atoms in the M-L network are FM coupled. Angle-dependent measurements show in-plane uniaxial anisotropy. Ligand-field multiplet calculations allow to reproduce the XMCD spectra obtained on the two substrates. An increased in-plane distortion is found in the case of Ag(111), suggesting a stronger M-L interaction. An analytical expression for the anisotropy energy is derived from the ligand field parameters confirming the in-plane uniaxial anisotropy. Finally superexchange and substrate-mediated interactions are discussed as possible causes for the observed magnetic coupling.

Finally, we perform model fusion between normally trained CNNs and knowledge guided CNNs. From these results, we see that those knowledge guided CNNs are complementary to those normally trained CNNs. For the normal BN-Inception architecture, the best combination of (A0) and (A2) reduces the top-5 error considerably from 17.4% to 16.3%. With the deeper BN-Inception network, the best combination of (B0) and (B2) achieves a top-5 error of 15.8%, compared to the original 16.7%. These excellent fusion results suggest that our proposed knowledge guided disambiguation techniques not only improve the performance of the original models, but also provide reliable complementary models that build stronger model ensemble.

ON THE SELECTION OF TRIADS
Benoit et al. claim that visual examination of the tail of our AmBe exposure distribution shows no neutron events. However, this must be compared with the shape of the γ-ray only time constant distribution also shown in our figure. This is found from high-statistics 60Co and 137Cs Compton scattering calibration runs to have a very sharp fall-off of the left hand branch. As discussed in our paper, this has been determined with high accuracy and fits a γ-ray distribution at all energies. We show one example of this in Figure 2 of our paper. A statistical analysis of the AmBe source population, together with the high accuracy Compton scattering runs, then shows a clearly significant additional population on the tail when the AmBe source is in place. From these data the time constant ratio can be determined with the error bar which we quote. Plotting the data in logarithmic or linear scale makes no difference to the statistical significance of the short time-constant population.

The observation of the rotation of the plane of polarization as a function of wavelength in extragalactic radio sources has long been known to give unique information on the strength of cosmological magnetic fields (Kronberg 1994). This technique gives information out to redshift of about 2.5, and can in principle do this on the line of sight to a polarized radio source at any redshift.
The Arbitrary-Field RRM (ARRM) model is an extension of the original RRM formalism to allow consideration of arbitrary circumstellar field topologies. The theoretical basis remains the same: the distribution of density ρ along a given closed magnetic flux tube is calculated by solving the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium subject to gravitational and centrifugal forces. This yields

Conclusion
The latest ITRF realizations are derived from four space geodesy techniques: VLBI, GPS, SLR, and DORIS, whereas the ICRF is the result only of the global VLBI solution. The latter is tied to the ITRF datum using an arbitrary set of reference stations. VLBI also contributes, along with SLR, to the ITRF scale. Furthermore, all the techniques contribute to the positions and velocities of ITRF stations. As a consequence, we face systematic errors involving the connection between the ICRF and ITRF realizations, which cannot be fixed by datum correction during the current solution.

We have studied the symmetry of neutrino mixing, assuming one residual symmetry each survives for the charged leptons and the neutrinos after the spontaneous breakdown from a finite horizontal symmetry group. The problem is studied both from the bottom up and from the top down. In the former approach, starting from any one of the three partial mixing patterns defined by (1), a list of horizontal groups labeled by n can be constructed to yield a specific pattern, and the result for n = 3 is explicitly shown in eq. (3). In the latter approach, a necessary condition for a finite group to be horizontal is given, and a general recipe is provided to decide what mixing patterns it contains, and how to produce an effective dynamical models giving rise to such a pattern automatically after the right-handed and the heavy leptons are integrated out.

Comparing Models
The multi-modal nature of the optimization problem is not the only modeling pitfall to be reckoned with. A good fit between model periods and data certainly suggests that the model adequately reflects the actual physical structure of the stars themselves. However, the possibility can never be ruled out that other physical characteristics of the white dwarf models, considered known and held fixed in the present modeling work, could also be varied to yield comparably good fits to the observed frequencies. As with any inverse problem, asteroseismic inferences are plagued by the potential for non-uniqueness of the solutions. With this caveat firmly in mind, we proceed.

These results raise many questions. For example, it is clear that there is great freedom in choosing codes to purify states. While we have given some sufficient conditions for choosing codes, we have not studied how to match codes and states to give high efficiency of purified state production. We expect each state/code combination to have its own conditions on the required fidelity of the input states. Strategies for maximizing thresholds and efficiencies are likely to be as rich as those used in other fault-tolerant quantum information processing tasks.

If we regulate the S independent piece in the above manner to control its divergence, (which is enough to make the last term of integral (48) finite for all non-zero S), then it will no longer cancel with the S dependent terms in the limit S → 0, since these terms still diverge. Therefore we must find a way to regulate the S dependent pieces too, so that they will be finite in the S → 0 limit, and properly cancel with the regulated S independent piece. Bearing this in mind, and noting the following integral identity,

This is exactly the question we try to answer in this paper. Towards this end we try to give hardness results for graph families which are as simple as possible. Perhaps most striking among them is a result showing that not only is avoiding all trees not enough but in fact it is necessary to avoid the much smaller class of uncolored paths if one hopes for an elementary parameter dependence. As an example application, this almost immediately rules out the existence of meta-theorems with elementary parameter dependence in any induced-subgraph-closed graph class with unbounded diameter and any edge-subdivision-closed graph class. This explains why all recently shown meta-theorems we mentioned work on classes which are closed under induced subgraphs but have bounded diameter and are not closed under edge subdivisions.

In contrast to such inner disk oscillations, classes ν, θ, and β show a more gradual change from a high-soft to low-hard state and they are characterized by a sharp soft dip when both H1 and H2 are low and the variability too drops to a low level.

We have seen that there is room, but no need, for a signal in the measured antiproton fluxes. We have also seen that the optimal energy to look for when searching for antiprotons is either below the solar modulation cut-off or at higher energies than currently measured. However, there are no special spectral features in the signal spectra compared to the background, unless the signal is enhanced and one looks at higher energies (above 10 GeV).

Our proposal consists of eliciting each subject to simulate the arousal of Yerkes-Dodson Law. To explore all the stress possibilities, our method is based two different test: one of visual attention and another of logical reasoning. Each individual starts in a comfort situation, continuing with an alertness and optimal performance state, and finishing with an anxiety and breakdown condition. If we go across the obtained results, its calibrates each individual performance because we have all the possible arousal points. Therefore we only have to make a relation with the achievement performance.
Hence the scheme used for detector description must be flexible and versatile. Any information potentially of interest to more than one application, in particular all geometric parameters and relationships, must exist as data, not code.

A method was created to determine the strength of a weak neutron source using a HPGe detector. Three different reactions in both the thermal and fast neutron regimes were used to determine the neutron activity of an AmBe source. The independently-determined activities show consistency and result in a neutron activity of 305.6 ± 4.9 n/s. The neutron activity determined using a measurement of the 4483 keV γ ray from the AmBe source directly yielded an activity of 305.0 ± 16.1 n/s.

the first term generates the masses of up type quarks, while the second and third- masses of down quarks and leptons respectively.
Longer k-mers did not improve the sequence and may have decreased the quality of the assemblies. Although the number of contigs and the apparent coverage of the tuna genome is greater with k=51 (Table 3), this coverage exceeds the known length of the tuna genome by 18% or more than 140 Mb. Two factors may contribute to this result. Firstly, with shorter k-mers and a threshold of 100 bp for inclusion in the list of counted contigs, more short contigs are excluded with k=25. These short contigs have reduced sequence variability compared to longer contigs and may represent segments of the same repeat structure (Figure 2). Contigs such as those containing mononucleotide runs are excluded at shorter k-mer lengths. As contig length increases, the major change in the graph in Figure 2 is that the minimum diversity values increase, and at short contig lengths the low diversity values are driven by poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(T) segments. Secondly, the distribution of contig length by contig frequency showed a clear artefact in the distribution of the k=51 contigs for both PDB3 and PDB5 (Figure 3). This artefact would inflate the coverage by contigs of size 100 to 200 bp. Further analyses of the draft assemblies were restricted to k=25.

The QSO 2dF redshift survey fields form part of the area of sky surveyed by the galaxy 2dF survey, and so the objects in the QSO and galaxy 2dF redshift surveys are being observed simultaneously with 2dF. This leads to significant gains in both efficiency (the combined survey can be carried out in 20 nights less than if the surveys had been separate) and completeness (the QSO survey will pick up compact blue galaxies, the galaxy survey will identify extended low-redshift QSOs).

In the alternate scenario, if Lorentz symmetry remains exact down to small distances, then any potential nonlinearity scale is set by a length parameter, possibly the Planck length, and thus the smallness of the potential nonlinear corrections to Schrodingers may be attributed to the weakness of gravity.

On a capital market the social group is formed from traders. Individual behaviour of agents is influenced by the need to associate with other agents and to obtain the approval of other agents in the group. Making decisions an individual equates own needs with those of the other agents from the group. Any two agents from the group may interact. The interaction consists of the exchange of information and it costs some money. We assume that agents interact in such a way that they give reference to the origin of the information if asked by other agents. Thus the agent may verify obtained private information. Hudak recently used methods described by Rivier to study social behaviour of such agents. He characterized the quantity which corresponds to verification of information. Here we study a capital market and social behaviour of agents relations. Quantity which characterizes verification of information contributes to an aversion of an agent with respect to a risk. The mix of investments of an agent in a given cell with an average measure A of risk aversion in the cell is found from minimum of the average per cell aim function <FM >. Absolute minimum corresponds to such a state in which there is an optimal mix of the exchange of information for a given expectations about the capital market. The crowd and personal /≈ < f > / contributions to the risk aversion of an agent are present in the aversion constant A. We have discussed a stable and metastable states of the market for different values of E, an expected return for a given investment period, of EV, an expected risk for a given investment period, and of b, a constant which characterizes contribution of the quantity <f > to the risk aversion. Characteristics of the variance of n for the distribution of nonreducibile subgroups are found. Our model describes intermediary process effects.

Namaste is therefore a useful tool, allowing more targeted follow-up observations with radial velocity measurements and the search for additional transits. For giant planets around bright stars, subsequent RV follow-up could lead to their confirmation. Smaller planets around fainter stars could still be validated with follow-up techniques such as diffraction-limited imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy.

An essential part of present-day high-precision frequency measurements is related to experiments performed in the presence of some residual electric or magnetic field. To reduce the uncertainty caused by the field, one tries to perform the measurement on those sublevels which are under control, e.g., for sublevels slightly affected by the perturbing field. Here, we study another possible option to deal with a residual magnetic field. We show that despite the presence of a perturbing magnetic field shifting the energy levels, there are some special combinations of energies which do not depend on the magnetic field at all. In the case of microwave measurements that may be used, e.g., to determine the hyperfine separation in the ground state. There are also some more specific combinations, and in particular ones where the dependence on the magnetic field is linear.
For the upper bound, it suffices to show that

The potential arising from the donor causes impurity bands to form from linear combinations of the low-lying conduction band states, pulling them down into the band gap. In the limit of infinite defect separation the width of these bands would drop to zero, giving a clear separation between localised bound states and scattering states; for the finite supercells accessible to our calculations the impurity bands retain a finite width and the distinction is not clear-cut. Nevertheless a single band can be identified with its minimum at the Γ-point, which lies below all the other states. The band dispersion (approximately 0.1 eV) is large compared with the expected spacing of the Rydberg series associated with the hydrogenic impurity (30 meV or less) so only the lowest state is clearly resolved below the continuum; nevertheless this is the state most relevant to low-temperature measurements.

Other Examples
In elastic network models a simplified structural representation is achieved by representing any monomeric unit of the biopolymer with one or more beads. Accordingly, the model potential energy is equivalent to the one of a set of N beads connected by pairwise harmonic springs which penalize deviations of inter-bead distances from their typical, reference values. Thus, the elastic network does not directly restrain the absolute positions of the beads but only their distances. In the simplest formulation, the spring constant of the harmonic pairwise interaction is set equal to a master spring constant k whenever the reference distance between the two beads is smaller than a pre-assigned interaction cutoff (Rc), and set to zero otherwise.

When observing with NACO in cube mode the frames are stored in data cubes of 30 to more than 500 frames, with only one single header. This implies that the hour angle for each single frame cannot directly be derived from the header, since solely one LST value is given. Thus the observing time for every single frame has to be interpolated in order to get the correct parallactic angles, which can become problematic when frame loss occurs.
We continue by discussing the implications of this negative-delay phenomenon from a more general perspective. The pump-induced field effect can be a generic phenomenon for materials in which the photoexcited charge distribution gives rise to a macroscopic electric field. This would not be the case in metals, because excess charges are efficiently screened and the time-integrated Coulomb field effect is negligible. However, due to less efficient screening this field effect may be substantial for a wide variety of semiconductors including the recently discovered topological insulators. Our work defines a general framework to disentangle the intrinsic electron dynamics from the long-range field effect in trARPES experiments.

In conclusion, to our knowledge for the first time, we have demonstrated directly the evolution of charge density wave due to localized electronic states. It is also shown that a soft gap opens up across the CDW transition. The energy dependence of the spectral density of states reveals the role of magnetism on the electronic structure in the vicinity of Fermi level, which signals an intimate relationship between ferromagnetism and charge density wave in this system. The observation of profound changes in the Ba-O covalency prior to the formation of charge density wave poses a new question with respect to the role of precursor effects.

Obviously, our requirement for the disk to be thin at rin is ad hoc, motivated by our desire to have as simple structure as possible. Our toy model may require uninterestingly low accretion rate to satisfy all the conditions that are imposed at its inner boundary: hydrostatic equilibrium, low geometrical thickness, high entropy and low internal energy. It is very likely that at the accretion rate of any interest some of these conditions are broken. It is likely that the cusp at rin opens up considerably, the speed of sound is not negligible compared to rotational velocity, and the transonic flow carries a non trivial amount of internal energy into the black hole (Loska 1982). However, the conservation laws do not require the advected thermal energy to be large, as demonstrated by our toy model.
Therefore, we have that

The configurations ν = 3 and ν = 4 have the Cv symmetry and reveal higher energy and larger critical exponents than the previous ones. The last ν = 5 configuration with all electrons on a line is the least significant because of its high energy and its high critical exponent.
The genus of a matter curve gives us information about the number of moduli the curve has. Since these moduli have to be stabilized, matter curves of low genus are desirable from a phenomenological point of view. In the generic situation the equations specifying the Yukawa points can be expressed as classes Y1, Y2 in terms of the toric divisors. The number of Yukawa points is then given by the following intersection product:

Tycoon is a resource management system that builds on virtualization to implement a specific resource management strategy: resource usage optimization via a bidding system and a global economy. In this aim, it benefits from the resource sharing capability of virtual machines, and in particular the ability of Xen to dynamically adjust the proportion of CPU cycles allocated to different VMs. In addition, as a system that brings up execution environments to remote users, it benefits from data isolation between VMs: a priori untrusted users can access VMs, install and run their own software without threatening each other nor the backing OS.

At sufficiently high baryon density, matter is expected to be deconfined. The physical degrees of freedom in a deconfined phase are quarks and gluons, rather than usual hadrons. At present the theory cannot predict reliably where in the QCD phase diagram the corresponding deconfinement transition should occur. The issue gets further complicated by the fact that the deconfinement is not associated with a symmetry-related order parameter and, thus, does not need to be marked by any real phase transition. Leaving aside this well-known conceptual difficulty, here I discuss the recent progress in the studies of cold and dense matter which, owing in part to the property of the asymptotic freedom in QCD, allows a relatively rigorous treatment.
Then, we asked participants why they used 2F and why they thought other people would; this helped us understand the motivation and the context in which they used 2F. Users were also asked to recall the last time they had used any 2F technology and report any encountered issues and whether or not they wanted to change the technology (and, if so, how). If users had used multiple technologies, we also asked to compare them, and this helped us understand how participants use and perceive 2F technologies.

It has been proposed that relativistic kinematics considerations necessitate that the Thomas precession gives rise to certain forces that resemble the rotational pseudoforces known as the Coriolis, Euler, and centrifugal forces. It has been shown to order v2/c2 that the predicted anti-Coriolis force of the Thomas precession accounts for the existence of the magnetic force. The possible correspondence of the strong nuclear force to an anti-centrifugal force of the Thomas procession was investigated.

The existence of the fermion EDM depends on the CP violating fermion-fermion-photon interaction. In the framework of the SM, the CP violation is carried by the complexity of the Cabbibo Cobayashi Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements and the estimated numerical values of EDMs of fermions are extremely small. This makes it charming to investigate new complex phases by considering the physics beyond the SM. The model III version of the 2HDM is one of the candidate since the FC neutral currents (FCNC) are permitted at tree level and the new Yukawa couplings can be complex in general. With the addition of spatial extra dimensions which are felt by the new Higgs doublet there appear additional contributions sensitive to the compactification scale 1/R where R is the radius of the compactification. The Yukawa Lagrangian responsible for the EDM fermion in such a single extra dimension reads:

We turn, then, to the program of formulating a broken Yang-Mills theory of strong and weak interactions, with an effective energy of unification between 1014 GeV and the Planck mass. This program is only slightly less immodest in conception than the overall unification program of self-coupled supergravity. For the sake of expressing all the Yang-Mills coupling constants in terms of a single one, a simple group G is employed. (Actually one could use G × G, G × G × G, etc. with discrete symmetries connecting the factors, but we shall treat here only the case of a single G.)

In future studies of dilepton production from nucleus-nucleus collisions, one should thus include both finite particle widths and the medium modification of hadron properties. This is necessary for identifying the signatures of the quark-gluon plasma and the precursor phenomena related to the phase transition from the hadronic background. We expect that for photon production from hot dense matter there will be similar effects, and we plan to investigate this in the future.
After the classic application of relativistic wave equations to the atomic spectrum of hydrogen atom, there were several other applications of the relativistic wave equations to well-known problems of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. In the simplest from, one can cite the work of Sauter2 , who treated the problem of a particle in an uniform field relativistically. Srinivasa Rao et.al.3, have dealt with the relativistic rigid rotator in an elegant way, treating the rotor as a dumbbell with equal masses. Following the prescription of Rao, we extend the treatment to a linear rotator with unequal masses. The foregoing discussion is applicable to any heteronuclear system, special case of which is the homonuclear species. Such studies, apart from being pedagogical in nature are potentially exciting and shed light on the spectra of diatomic molecules.

In this paper, we studied effects of strong electron-phonon interaction in quantum dots with a vibrational degree of freedom. At sufficiently strong couplings the vibron-induced polaron shift overcomes the charging energy cost and the effective potential for electrons favors large charging. The instability towards an arbitrarily large electron population on the dot is regularized by the anharmonic contribution to the phonon energy. The effective potential differs qualitatively from the usual Coulomb repulsion, leading to characteristic modifications of the low temperature Coulomb blockade properties. Signatures include a rapid change in the average and the fluctuations of the electron number as function of the gate charge in the neighborhood of Qg = 0 as well as the temperature dependence of these quantities. Moreover, transport properties also show a number of unique signatures that can be used to characterize the negative-U instability and the nonlinear phonon effects.

However, macro micro strategy is able to identify the root cause behind congestion which is the conflicting directions and reports congestion successfully.

We have derived a general framework to deal with electromagnetic properties of charged fluids and we have derived some of their main properties. We have shown the existence of two coupled electromagnetic-matter modes for a given frequency inside a viscous charged fluid, one of these two has a negative value for the real part of the index of refraction for low frequency. Moreover we have computed some observables: reflection and transmission coefficients, that could be measured in actual experiments. Our results provide perspectives for a novel generation of experiments and devices for the detection of viscosity in charged or electron liquids and the possible exploitation of multiple waves and negative refraction in such systems.

Such results lead to the question of the relative importance of thermal conduction/evaporation versus dynamical processes such as this sort of triggered condensation. It is clear that the evaporation timescale is long enough that evaporation is unlikely to be important in regions experiencing such strongly dynamical processes. On the other hand in more quiescent regions, evaporation could dominate. The overall importance of conduction thus depends on an understanding of the larger scale evolution of the ISM and such things as the frequency of shock crossing for a given shock strength or the frequency and relative speed for cloud-cloud collisions. The old questions of the filling factor of CNM, WNM, WIM (warm ionized medium) and HIM (hot ionized medium) and their relative arrangement in the ISM clearly also has bearing on the lifetime for tiny H i clouds. As we have shown, the ambient medium in which the clouds are embedded could be crucial to determining their lifetimes.

In this work we attempt to answer some of these questions in a bottom-up approach, in which both (1) and three of its partial patterns are studied. The latter are bimaximal mixing without trimaximal mixing, tirmaximal mixing without bimaximal mixing, and a third pattern specified by the first column of U in (1), just like bimaximal and trimaximal mixing are respectively specified by the third and the second columns. We shall label these patterns by an index α: the full pattern is α = 0, and the partial pattern specified by column i of (1) is α = i. For a partial pattern, one column of the mixing matrix is fixed, and the other two are arbitrary, subject only to unitarity considerations.

Recently, Verwichte et al. (2004) have detected interesting phenomenon of simultaneous existence of fundamental and first harmonics of fast kink oscillations (see also De Moortel & Brady 2007; Van Doorsselaere et al. 2007). However, the ratio between the periods of fundamental and first harmonics P1/P2 was significantly shifted from 2, which later was explained as a result of longitudinal density stratification in the loop (Andries et al. 2005; McEwan et al. 2006). The rate of the shift allows to estimate the density scale height in coronal loops, which can be few times larger compared to its hydrostatic value (Aschwanden et al. 2000).

Introduction
In calculations of the probability distribution for the cosmological constant, it has been previously assumed that the a priori probability distribution is essentially constant in the very narrow range that is anthropically allowed. This assumption has recently been challenged. Here we identify large classes of theories in which this assumption is justified.
This example illustrates the necessity to characterize the interactions among sub-bases whose inconsistency measures can be summed up. To this end, we propose the following independent decomposability property:

It is interesting to note that regulation policies for the lowest and the higher layers are closer to each other than the middle ones. Policies to regulate the poorest layer will also contribute positively in regulating the upper ones. The middle layers follow a different dynamics on its own mostly due to the fact that they receive and send family units from both sides of the distribution.
Is there a way to compute which triangles are invalidated in each cell of the arrangement in a way proportional to the depth of that cell in the presence of constraints? (Our realistic input analysis does not extend to the constrained version of the problem.)

There are several potential directions for future work. First, our model can be further improved by exploring multi-task learning approaches to combine more useful and correlated information. For example, we can jointly train a neural network model with both the POS and NER tags to improve the intermediate representations learned in our network. Another interesting direction is to apply our model to data from other domains such as social media (Twitter and Weibo). Since our model does not require any domain- or task-specific knowledge, it might be effortless to apply it to these domains.

Conclusions
It is tempting to suggest that kinematic components, which we see in S235, correspond to sequential evolutionary stages. In this line of reasoning, the most advanced stage of the triggered star formation would be represented by the East2 and Central clusters, where a non-negligible amount of gas has already been accelerated by stellar winds. The clump coincident with the East1 cluster would be at the intermediate stage as it is actively forming stars but have not yet developed any observable wind signatures.

In this section we collect several general results concerning the duality theory of precompact groups. Some of them appear in the literature, while others might be known to specialists, but it seems convenient to have them all collected here for future references. In any case, the two lemmas below are well known.
The braided fields constructed in this manner are taken as an initial condition in numerical relaxation experiments. An alternative would have been to begin with a uniform magnetic field between lower and upper boundaries and use a numerical technique to simulate photospheric motions and obtain a braided field and to then proceed to relaxation techniques. However, here our primary interest lies in the relaxation process and its consequences and so we take the analytical models as a proxy for a field constructed through simulated photospheric motions The advantages of this approach lie in a significant saving in computational time, the ability to easily adopt fields with the aforementioned braid properties and a model that lends itself to analytical analysis.

September 23: The same six tails can be seen again, although more faintly, and with position angles that have rotated clockwise in the plane of the sky. This rotation provided the main clue that the tails are synchrones (Paper 1), caused by impulsive dust emission on a range of dates.
If the autocorrelation of the coding pattern is not bi-valued with a single central peak and flat wings, then ghosts of bright sources will occur in correlation images. They can in principle be avoided by noting that at each of the ND points in the detector one measures a linear combination of the contributions from each point in the sky (plus background). Provided the problem is not underdetermined, the inverse of the matrix representing this coding can be used to obtain the sky distribution which led to the observed data.

Step 4a is required when the low-energy expansion is being used as an efficient means to accurately calculating observables in a well-understood theory. It is the option of choosing instead Step 4b, however, which introduces much of the versatility of effective-lagrangian methods. Step 4b is useful both when the underlying theory is not known (such as when searching for physics beyond the Standard Model) and when the underlying physics is known but complicated (like when describing the low-energy interactions of pions in Quantum Chromodynamics).

ASCA observed MCG-6-30-15 for ≈ 4.2 days from 1994 July 23 to 27 (Tanaka, Inoue & Holt 1994). This long exposure allowed for the first time the detection of a broad Iron line (Tanaka et al. 1995). A subsequent detailed analysis by Iwasawa et al. (1996) showed that the line shape was variable and correlated to the intensity of the source. Iwasawa et al. (1996) grouped the data into three intensity levels called the low (LI), medium (MI) and high intensity (HI) data sets. During most (3/4) of the observation time, the source was in the medium intensity level. Iwasawa et al. fitted the line profile with a phenomenological two Gaussian model and accretion disk models around stationary (Schwarzschild) and rotating (Kerr) Black holes. This data has also been reanalyzed using alternate models like a Comptonizing cloud model (Misra & Sutaria 1999) and an occultation model (Weaver & Yaqoob 1998).

Unfiltered photo-polarimetric observations were made with the HIPPO (HI speed Photo-POlarimeter: Potter et al. 2010) on four separate occasions and reduced as in Potter et al. (2010).

Multiple eclipses were observed on the other occasions which were folded and binned from which measurements were made.
The symmetry of the potential implies that we have two types of solutions: the even solutions obtained by imposing (ignoring normalization) a0 = 1, a1 = 0 and the odd ones by imposing a0 = 0, a1 = 1. The energy eigenvalues are then obtained from the condition Ψ(E, L) = 0 for both cases.

The resonant interaction of several solitary waves may cause extreme waves higher than 4 times of amplitude of a solitary wave. This mechanism may happen in ocean; for instance, tsunami, freak wave and solitary killer wave may be amplified by this mechanism.

Introduction
Univariate analysis of multivariate genetic data sets usually results in a ranking of the variables according to some criterion. This ranking is then interpreted to gain biological knowledge and understanding. However, it has been noted that the variable rankings are often highly unstable with respect to small changes in the underlying data set or the method used to obtain the ranking and therefore, methods for stabilizing the variable ranking and allowing more robust comparison to other lists are much needed. In this paper we have presented a general framework for robust representation and comparison of variable lists. The framework encompasses both ordered and unordered lists, which can therefore be compared on similar terms. Having a robust measure of similarity between any pair of variable lists can furthermore enable visualization through e.g. multidimensional scaling to obtain a low-dimensional visual representation of large collections of lists. We have shown that the extended variable lists are more stable than the original variable lists from an experiment, and also more stable than lists obtained by aggregation of several lists from subsampled data sets. These results suggest that the exchangeability concept for random variables may be a suitable tool for quantifying the functional redundancy among genes and incorporating this information into the list representation.

We would thus tentatively suggest that, while further development is of course urgently needed, real path quantum theory has some scientific yield, even in its presently undeveloped state. This is the motivation to explore empirically whether quantum interference fails, with an open mind about what governs the transition between interference and effective decoherence. If we take the idea of real path quantum theory seriously, then until further theoretical and/or mathematical constraints are uncovered, this transition could be governed by almost any physically interesting parameter or combination of parameters: maximum beam separation, average beam separation, separation time, particle mass, and so on.

The CF model is purposely oversimplified. Such simplified models, with few parameters, provide insight into the essential ingredients of the mechanisms studied. At the same time the simplicity of the CF model leads to certain artifacts. Here we show that such artifacts can be alleviated by more detailed models. Below we discuss how one can allow for varying UCR and DCR lengths, and how alternative interaction potentials can be chosen, with distance-dependent forces.

Our algorithm provides the significance of the rotation identification (with a set of indices), the rotation amplitude, the position angle of the rotation axis, whether the rotation is clock or anticlock-wise and the rotation centre. We find that the amplitude of the rotation is correlated with the indications of rotation; the larger the rotation amplitude the more significant are the indications of rotation. This implies that small amplitude rotation may not be easy to identify, and thus it could pass undetected.

In preview of the paper layout, we begin by introducing the reaction-diffusion equations that we will use as the drive system. We discuss how this system is solved numerically and the parameters used to simulate complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Next, we implement the response system and show the parameter PDEs used to find autosynchronization. We demonstrate the power of the systems of PDEs to autosynchronize by employing three different spatial functions for the parameters. Next, we show the estimated parameters and the convergence plots for both state variables and parameters to the correct values. Finally, we give an improvement on the response system that admits autosynchronization wherein only one species is sampled, which is an important breakthrough for applications since generally only the phytoplankton is easily observable.

In the paper we have addressed Clinical Data Intelligence and postulated a number of conjectures we believe are important. Maybe the most important one is that a sensible analysis of data collected in a daily routine implies a Big Data analysis. We described under which conditions we believe scientific conclusions can be drawn from the data. We believe that much can be done already but to harvest the full power of a Clinical Data Intelligence, we need an improved clinical data situation. Once the information can be unlocked via a semantically rich, diverse and large data set, the potential benefit will be tremendous.

Each run was performed for a variety of training set sizes defined as a percentage of the number of available queries. In the case of the TREC-3 and TREC-5 data, the number of available queries is always 50. The number of segments into which each result set was divided was also varied. We used training set sizes, t such that t ∈ {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} and numbers of segments, x such that x ∈ {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500}.

So, we see that the Tsallis entropy is far away from its initial value, Eq. (10), as well as the Renyi entropy.
At high redshift, the sampled wavelength baseline is more limited than at low redshift, as the rest-frame UV and optical range fall in the observed optical and IR range; thus determinations of opacities are even less secure than in the local Universe. One could expect dust opacity to be a minor issue at high redshift, as young galaxies were also metal-poor and, therefore, dust-poor. However, low metallicities were coupled with large gas column densities, which can in principle produce non negligible opacities. In addition, standard observing techniques target the rest-frame UV emission from high redshift galaxies, a wavelength range very sensitive to the obscuring effects of dust.
In this paper, we only considered the vacuum energy at the one-loop level. Even at the same level, the correction to the Newton constant may also be induced in general. This would be related with the restriction or determination of the scale of the extra dimensions as well as the scale of m.

The colour-magnitude relation (CMR) of elliptical galaxies is a natural byproduct of galaxy formation scenarios involving galactic wind. However, those scenarios were initially based upon a simple model which ignored the internal structure and complex star formation history inherent to galaxy formation. Numerical simulations are a powerful complement which allows one to treat complex physical processes in galaxy formation self-consistently. We have developed a code that can calculate the dynamical, chemical, and photometric evolution of galaxies self-consistently. To understand further the physics of elliptical galaxy formation, we examine whether realistic numerical simulations can reproduce the observed CMR.

In summary, it has been shown that the first engineering flight of the AMS experiment has been very successful, both instrumentally and scientifically. This first step has provided a significant number of new unexpected physics results on the particle populations close to Earth. Although no new physics has emerged so far from these data, they are new and important and expected to provide some significant improvements in our understanding of the particle flux in the environment close to earth at the completion of the study. These result obtained in a region extensively explored by previous balloon or satellite experiments, illustrate the discovery potential of the spectrometer due to its instrumental characteristics: large geometrical acceptance, large momentum range and dynamics and particle identification capability, and to the long duration of the measurement campaign scheduled for the main phase of the experiment on the ISS, where close to 3 orders magnitude more statistics than in the first flight will be collected in much better instrumental conditions.

This housing regulation policy contradicts the intuition about a voiced general opinion that the land in Madrid should be deregulated to build more housing units and, therefore, decrease the overall prices. This suggestion might reduce the prices of the housing units, yet it could worsen the current situation in Madrid in the long term. From the housing-demographic point of view, and according to this nonlinear model, more deregulation of land can push the system even farther out of equilibrium.

The topics that need to be investigated range from the types of architectures to consider (ARM vs Intel x86 vs GPUs), the types of programming tool sets and languages (opencl, cuda, thrust, tbb, openmp, Google go), the models of parallelism (implicit, i.e., discovered by automated tools, vs explicit, i.e., exposed by the programmer). Much research has been done in the Computer Science (CS) community to discover patterns and algorithms for parallel computation, and another task is to understand what has been done in the CS community and how these patterns can be mapped onto HEP problems.

Apparently dark matter particles feel no other force than gravitation and can exchange kinetic energy or momentum only by elastic gravitational interaction or by direct collisions. But as will be discussed later, the contribution of distant interactions appears negligible, as the mean free path is too large to establish equilibrium in galaxy sized objects. The energy which the particles take up in a gravitational field is transferred to thermal motion preferably by collisions. Whether this thermal energy remains in the region, where it is produced, or if it is transported by conduction, depends on the mean free path. In the limit of small mean free path the local energy density equals the potential energy taken up during infall into the halo, the normal virial condition

To realise the potential of weak lensing at radio wavelengths requires a great deal of development work on analysis techniques and the demonstration of those techniques on real data. A key challenge will be to develop the field of galaxy shape estimation to the level of maturity that is currently enjoyed by the optical weak lensing community. The radio GREAT challenge has begun in order to draw attention to the highlighted issues and attract researchers from a number of fields to begin addressing them. In conjunction, real data from instruments such as eMERLIN and LOFAR will be available for demonstrating radio weak lensing techniques.

We see, therefore, how resonance and excited state lines complement one another. If a feature (indicated by excess or reduced absorption) appears at low velocity in an excited state line and then joins a high velocity feature in a resonance line (whose low velocity portion may be saturated) at higher velocity, this provides evidence that the excess or deficiency of opacity which caused the feature close to the stellar surface (where the radiation field is intense) propagated outward, into the wind.

Results and Discussion
The ghost propagators are not useful in the order we are working. The above propagators were written for generic gauge parameters: ξh and ξγ. Since our interest is in the study of gauge independent quantities, from now on, we will restrict to the Feynman gauges, ξh = ξγ = 1, which simplifies the very long calculations involved. Reproduction of the same results by calculating with generic parameters ξh and ξγ would be desirable, but we will leave it for future investigations.

Finally, we consider IPCs with two polar patches of equal charge but of different size. We start again from the 45n model and now change both the interaction range of one polar site, e.g. the site corresponding to patch 2, and its distance from the particle center in such a way that the quantity a2 + ρ2 remains constant. This procedure guarantees that in the corresponding coarse-grained system, the interaction range of patch 2 is the same as the interaction range of the whole particle, i.e. δ is fixed. For a specific interaction range, there is thus only one choice for a2 for a given ρ2, and vice versa; as a consequence there is only one the patch size γ2 associated to the choice of ρ2 and a2 or, equivalently, of ρ2 and δ.

Let us consider how the Hilbert action principle modifies in empty spacetime.
where T is a causally well-behaved triangulation of spacetime (taken to be topologically I × S3). The quantity CT is equal to the order of automorphism group of the triangulation T, and the 1/CT factor in the summation is known as the discrete measure because it weights highly symmetric geometries with a lower probability. In practice, the sum over triangulations is approximated using a Monte Carlo simulation which generates a set of independent histories.
Fragmentation time tff can be defined as the time where system breaks up in such a way that afterwards only some monomers are ejected. In order to estimate tff it is necessary to measure the simmilarities of partitions at different times, which can be done using the Microscopic Persistence Coefficient (Strachan and Dorso, 1999), which is defined as the probability that two particles belonging to a fragment of partition X remain together in a fragment of partition Y:

This is of course a big plus: the geometrical optics limit allows us to obtain rigorous results directly in the language of particles, rather than having to use the unwieldy and physically less transparent Bogolubov method that is more traditionally used. Moreover, as we shall see, the inclusion of back-reaction effects is also perhaps easier now.

Output requirements will not be severe either. A snapshot of the positions and velocities of all particles will only take 10 Mbytes. With, say, 105 snapshot outputs for a run, the total run worth 10 Pflops-day will result in an output of only 1 Tbyte.

In particular, indirect searches for neutralino annihilations inside the Sun, the Earth or the Galactic center are being undertaken by looking for neutrino fluxes resulting from the decay of gauge bosons and hadrons produced in the annihilations. Muon neutrinos can be detected via the up-going muons produced in charged-current interactions in the rock underneath the big underground (Baksan, MACRO, SuperK) and underwater/ice (AMANDA, BAIKAL, ANTARES) experiments. Since both the neutrino-nucleon cross section and the muon range increase with the neutrino energy, the neutrino indirect detection of neutralinos improves with the parent neutralino mass.

The fact that πC does not depend on the choice of any particular execution model T may help to explain why structural models choose to ignore the dynamic aspects of causality in the first place. Indeed, this result shows precisely that, for applications which only care about properties of the final state that the domain will eventually reach, the details of how this final state came about can be safely ignored. As I attempt to show in this paper, though, actual causation is not such an application.

We consider all hadronic resonances having well defined masses i.e., their decay widths are small. All hadronic resonances decay rapidly in strong decays after freeze-out and thus contribute to the stable particle abundances. Some heavy resonances may decay in cascades. This has been implemented in the calculation by considering all decays proceeding sequentially from the heaviest to lightest particles. As a consequence of this, the light particles get contributions from the heaviest particles. Thus it has the form:

For comparison with the ASCA observations and Galactic Center sources, we perform homogeneous X-ray spectral fitting of 23 (optically) identified CVs in globular clusters (47 Tuc, NGC 6397, ω Cen, NGC 6752, and M4), with >90 counts above 2 keV. We compare the fitted power-law photon indices and estimated X-ray luminosities of the globular cluster CVs with the observed CV populations in Figure 1a. The locations of globular cluster X-ray sources in this plot suggest that some (the brightest and hardest) are likely magnetic systems, while many others are likely nonmagnetic systems.

It is the good energy resolution that is the most dramatic factor of silicon detector. And it ensures the wide applications of these detectors on energy spectrum measurements and particle discrimination. Energy resolution depends on many physical factors, not only the detector itself, but also the front-end electronics system and even the energy and mass of the charged particle to be detected. If the impacts of system energy resolution are excluded, the intrinsic energy resolution of the detector should be better than 50 keV.

The foregoing remarks serve to justify the assumptions we shall make regarding the future cones of target and interceptor. It will be assumed that the subset of either cone lying to the future of its vertex is a manifold possessing a timelike foliation, whose leaves are locally convex, and which posesses a finite convex cover. In particular, there is no assumption that the future cone of either target or interceptor, or their leaves, are necessarily convex as a whole.

The system has no real-time capabilities. We believe this is not necessary for our target application of small-scale object scanning (unlike e.g. navigation, map-building, or odometry). Considering the low resolution of RGB images, the matching process is a matter of seconds. This bottleneck could be removed by an approximate nearest-neighbors search. Our impression is that our system requires the same or even less overall acquisition time compared to e.g. Kinect Fusion, which requires slow and steady motion around the object (and sometimes even a complete reset).

Magnetic fields are not just passive tracers of the gas motions in various astrophysical systems. Often, they play a decisive dynamical role that may be manifested in a number of, sometimes subtle, ways. This includes situations where a large-scale magnetic field governs the motion of the plasma, e.g., in launching, acceleration, and collimation of outflows, including relativistic jets; magnetically-channeled accretion on neutron stars, white dwarfs, and young stars; and gradual magnetic braking of accretion disks and stars. But dynamical effects of magnetic fields also include the effects of energetically sub-dominant small-scale turbulent magnetic fields in accretion disks and stars on the effective long-time-scale transport of some large-scale quantity, such as angular momentum or large-scale magnetic flux. This often involves a complicated interplay between magnetic fields, large-scale rotation, and turbulence. Perhaps, the most notable recent example is the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and its role in the angular momentum transport (AMT) in accretion disks.

As we have observed, certain search-related computational operations can be carried out very efficiently indeed in space endowed with an ultrametric. Chief among these computational operations is that nearest neighbor finding can be carried out in (worst case) constant computational time. Depending on the structure of the ultrametric space (i.e. if we can build a balanced dendrogram data structure), pairwise distance calculation can be carried out in logarithmic computational time.
It is often the case that effective use of a complex experimental system for a key science goal for which it is custom built requires a deep understanding of performance and systematics, which requires experience with the instrument and development of appropriate calibration methods in the commissioning phase.

ACLP tries to address this problem by a non-trivial integration of constraint solving within the abductive process. The general pattern of computation in ACLP consists of a cooperative interleaving between hypotheses and constraint generation, via abductive inference, with constraint satisfaction of the generated constraints. Abductive reasoning provides an incremental reduction of the high-level problem representation and goals to abductive hypotheses together with lower-level constraints whose form is problem independent. The integration of abductive reasoning with constraint solving in ACLP is cooperative, in the sense that the constraint solver not only solves the final constraint store generated by the abductive reduction but also affects dynamically this abductive search for a solution. It enables abductive reductions to be pruned early by setting new suitable constraints on the abducible assumptions into the constraint store, provided that this remains satisfiable. During the ACLP computation there is a non-trivial interaction between (i) reduction of goals and consistency checking of abducible assumptions, (ii) setting new constraints in the constraint store of reduction and (iii) generating further abductive hypotheses.

It is universally recognized that the NVO would be a powerful tool for the astronomical community. A particular emphasis will be placed on the need for the NVO to make the most efficient use of the large datasets in our present holdings and to future projects. However, perhaps one of the most common uses of the NVO will be of the one human/one workstation type project.
The plan of this work is as follows: In section 2, we will develop our model and derive the main equations of motion. Particularly, emphasis will be put on the equations of a massive dilaton in the asymptotic regime. The latter should show the long range behaviour of the solutions, and consequently is connected with the confining phase. Section 3 will be devoted to the existence of analytical solutions from which we shall extract a new class of interquark potentials whose magnitude grows with the separation between the quark and antiquark. The main features of these potentials will be presented along with their connection to some popular phenomenological ones. Finally our conclusion will be drawn in section 4.
Certain ranges of the magnetic field are of special importance and directly related to integer and half-integer structures: Whenever the magnetic field is such that the Fermi energy falls between two Landau levels, the LDOS is highly suppressed and we obtain the integrated LDOS

In summary, crossing symmetry almost certainly holds for the long-range force between heavy quarks, but the naive crossing-symmetric partner, a color electric flux loop, would be practically indistinguishable from ordinary meson systems. However, if large color magnetic loops were produced, their coupling to light quarks might be weak enough to allow distinctive signals of their presence. We want now to suggest that exactly such an effect could occur in a simple and natural way.

As the interaction progresses, the slowest photons (low k-value) will start to lag behind with respect to the fastest photons. This will cause the pulse to be stretched and chirped (i.e. tilted in phase space). Due to the continued energy transfer from the photons to the plasma, the mean values of ω and k for the pulse as a whole will decrease, causing it to undergo a general redshift. We also find that the pulse (moving with vg < c) is lagging behind with respect to the simulation box (moving with c), and more so for decreasing photon momentum.

Performance Analysis: Since our architecture is aimed to alleviate network latency, performance analysis component is deemed to analyze communication latency and resource consumption pattern of different Service. If the amount of resources required to run a particular Service is not in balance with other factors such as communication delay, the resource scheduling tasks should be repeated to determine more appropriate infrastructure. Additionally, the relation between frequency of a Service invoking and execution and the amount of resources consumed is monitored by this component. The result of this analysis is useful to enhance the quality of overall execution. For example, if a delay-sensitive Cloud Service is invoked too frequently, the Service can be moved to a nearby MNO or its authorized dealer to tackle the communication latency.
Finally we give two examples, where we work through the main steps of the algorithm. The first of these examples is the easier case of trivial character, while the second example with non-trivial character showcases some other aspects of the algorithm.

Like other block-matching algorithms, we use sum of absolute differences (SAD) to detect pixel block similarity. In addition to detecting matching regions, we score blocks based on their abundance of edges. This allows us to disambiguate the situation where two pixel blocks might both be completely black, giving a good similarity score, but still not providing a valid stereo match. To generate an edge map, we use a Laplacian with an aperture size (ksize) of 3. We then take the summation of the 5x5 block in the edge map and reject any blocks below a threshold for edge-abundance.

The driver sometimes pays attention to not only the headway but also the headway of the immediately preceding one. If the headway of the preceding car is short, the driver assumes that the forward driver decelerates, thus the driver decrease the optimal velocity even though the headway of his car is long enough. On the other hand, if the headway of the preceding car is long, the driver assumes that the forward driver accelerates, thus the driver increase the optimal velocity even though the headway of his car is short.

An alternative transport mechanism to turbulent diffusion whose effects have been investigated in the last years in the solar nebula is photophoresis (Krauss & Wurm 2005; Wurm & Krauss 2006; Krauss et al. 2007; Mousis et al. 2007; Wurm et al. 2010). This effect is based on a radiation-induced temperature gradient on the surface of a particle and the consequential nonuniform interaction with surrounding gas. When the existence of an inner gap is postulated in the disk, this latter becomes optically thin enough for particles to see the proto-Sun, but still has a reasonable gas content, which enables the photophoretic force to push dust grains outward (Mousis et al. 2007). This process provides a mechanism to transport high-temperature material from the inner solar system to the regions in which the comets were forming. Eventually, the dust driven outward in this manner will reach a region where the gas pressure and irradiation are so low that the combined outward forces of radiation pressure and photophoresis can only balance the inward drift of particles.

Finally, we hypothesize that for stars with an intermediate latitude with a rotational period commensurable to the orbit of a close planet, star-planet interactions might induce spot formation preferentially at this latitude, which would show up as a resonance between the dominant period in the out-of-transit lightcurve and the planetary orbit, and also as the stroboscopic effect if the planet is transiting and the transit chord intersects this active latitude. However, proving this hypothesis might be difficult mostly because of the small number of bright targets and the uncertainties in differential rotation parameters.
If the coupling were this weak, the experiment has no practicle possibility of detecting dark energy.

As the solar spectrum is so intense, on some solar telescopes no calibration lamps are deemed necessary, and the wavelength scale is set using the solar spectrum itself. Reasonable precision can be reached using the spectrum at the centre of the disc to compare with previously measured disc centre wavelengths, thus avoiding differential shifts due to the limb effect. In this case, small scale motions have to be averaged out, integrating in time and/or space, in order to minimize errors.

This procedure provides an equation for a/r. We then determine a/b where b is the polar radius, by a/b = a/r (cos θ = 0). Since the polar radius is assumed to be known (66,854 km), we finally find the equatorial radius a, and the values of j2n for an assumed rotation period ω (see paper I for further details).

The total mass of a satellite halo is defined to be its virial mass when it first enters the host halo. After this point, it is assumed that its central structure is frozen. Any loss of mass would be restricted to the outer shells, not affecting the central mass which is of interest here. Such changes (in total mass after accretion) are not relevant because the discussion concerns the temperature of the halo with regard to cooling, which will have mostly taken place while the halo is still isolated. (Substructures are not expected to retain their hot halos long after accretion).

The results of the experimental study indicate that dimensionality reduction is a promising approach for the construction of ensembles of classifiers. In 113 out of 204 cases the dimensionality reduction ensembles outperformed the plain algorithm with the following distribution: RPE (33 cases out of 113), DM+AdaBoost (30 cases), RSE (27 cases) and DM (23 cases).

The model has two different populations (host and vector) and the expected basic reproduction number should reflect the infection transmitted from host to vector and vice-versa. If R0 < 1, then, on average, an infected individual produces less than one new infected individual over the course of its infectious period, and the disease cannot grow. Conversely, if R0 > 1, then each individual infects more than one person, and the disease can invade the population.

where ms is the scale of supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector. The value of ξ depends on the loop order of the associated graph (two or three in this case) which, in turn, depends on the particular non-renormalizable term that gives rise to the tadpole. Such terms lead to a vev for the light singlet S much larger than the electroweak scale. Thus, it seems that the non-renormalizable terms that are able to make the walls disappear before nucleosynthesis are the ones that destabilize the hierarchy.
The extended model can be generalized in a straightforward manner to describe also inhibitiory synapses and spatio-temporal aspects of real networks by use of (on larger time-scales) time-dependent values Ai(t) of synaptic strength.

A deterministic pattern has specific states, and the transition of the system to a new state depends only on its current state regardless of the previous states or any other values. These systems are similar somehow to road signs as road signs have only three states; red, orange, and green, and the transition of the system to a new state (orange for example) depends only on its current state (red).

The objective of this paper is to analyze in some detail the collapse of an inhomogeneous dust cloud in higher dimensions to cover both non self-similar and self-similar models. We also access the curvature strength of central shell focusing singularities. We find that gravitational collapse of a non self-similar higher dimensional spacetime gives rise to a naked strong-curvature shell-focusing singularity, providing an explicit counter-example to the CCH.
We used an improved version of the LensCLEAN algorithm (Kochanek & Narayan 1992; Ellithorpe, Kochanek, & Hewitt 1996) to constrain the position of the lens centre, which is the most important model parameter. LensCLEAN works by deconvolving radio interferometer data under the constraint of a given lens model. The residuals are then used to find the best fitting lens model.

To quantify the overall characteristics of our patterns we note the following. The number of fingers surviving up to a certain length as the fingers grow. The cumulative length distribution shows a linear behaviour in a log-log plot. log N(l) vs. log(l) plot is shown in fig. 3 where N(l) is the number of fingers with length greater than l. The slope of this plot fsurv is a measure of the competition in finger growth. The values of fsurv are plotted in table I for different values of the parameters.
If the amplification gets large enough, the light flux reaching the pixel in the direction of the star will temporarily rise above the fluctuations of the output of the pixel. If this rise is large enough, and lasts long enough we call this an event (see an example on figure 2).

We begin by introducing the definitions and notation required for the remainder of the paper. Let S be a finite set of points in the plane in general position, that is, no three on a line. Denote the convex hull of S by CH(S). The boundary vertices of CH(S), and the interior of CH(S) are denoted by V(CH(S)) and I(CH(S)), respectively. Finally, for any finite set Z ⊆ S, |Z | denotes the cardinality of Z.
The transit and the stellar signal cannot be separated effectively if they overlap too much in the frequency domain. Because of this, commonly used pre-detections stellar variability filters, such as the NIF, alter the transit signal, causing systematic errors in the resulting star and planet parameters. We have quantified this effect using 20 CoRoT BT2 simulated light curves including transits, instrumental noise and stellar variability. We found that the effect on the transit signal can be very significant, leading to errors on the star-planet radius ratio up to 50%.

In the standard analysis of the stability of the massless excitations, one needs to include all the counter terms that have the right symmetries into the Lagrangian, since those terms can be generated by perturbative fluctuations. Then we examine if those allowed counter terms can destroy the massless excitations or not. In our problem, we need to consider all the possible corrections to the mean-field ansatz. However, the new feature here is that it is incorrect to use the symmetry group to determine the allowed corrections. We should use PSG to determine the allowed corrections in our analysis of the stability of the massless excitations.

Next, high energy protons escape from the hot spot via sideways expansions and they injected in the minilobes. Then, they undergo various coolings in the lobes, i.e, adiabatic loss, pγ interaction, and proton synchrotron cooling. Below, we calculate these processes with the Monte Carlo simulation.
Using the conservation of the trace, determinant and sum of principal minors of the Hermitian matrices MD under unitary transformations, we are led to a complete determination of the moduli of all their elements, which can be expressed to high accuracy as follows:

There is also a third approach. Instead of manually deriving an analytical performance model, it can be built automatically instead, using machine leaning methods. A random set of candidate implementations are executed, and the measured execution times are used to learn a statistical model. This model is then used to pick promising candidates for evaluation, as with traditional model driven auto-tuning.

Evaluation: We carry out a human study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). We show human evaluators a dialogue context along with two potential responses: one response generated from each model conditioned on the dialogue context. We ask evaluators to choose the response most appropriate to the dialogue context. If the evaluators are indifferent, they can choose neither response. For each pair of models we conduct two experiments: one where the example contexts contain at least 80 unique tokens (long context), and one where they contain at least 20 (not necessarily unique) tokens (short context). We experiment with the LSTM, HRED and VHRED models, as well as a TF-IDF retrieval-based baseline model. We do not experiment with the MrRNN models, because we do not have appropriate coarse representations for this domain.
The aspect ratio that we use for convex cells is defined by the maximum distance between any pair of vertices contained in a cell divided by the minimum of the maximum distance between each vertex and every facet. Thus, the aspect ratio can be seen as the ratio between the longest and shortest spanning lengths of a cell.

From Newton gravity theory, the action of, say, the Sun on a planet is understood as a continuous taking of some amount of momentum, along the line joining the planet to the Sun, keeping the planet on a closed or open orbit, according to its initial energy. The bending of light rays obey to a similar effect, although General Relativity predicts twice the nonrelativistic shift.
Finally we turn to distance phrases. As mentioned above, distance cannot be sensibly predicated of non-delimited paths, so I will assume that distance predication is restricted to delimited paths. Consequently, bare distance phrases will behave just like to-PPs, which explains both why Jack ran two miles to the bridge is fine and why * Jack ran two miles for ten minutes is out. Now, what about distance phrases headed by for? Remarkably, these adverbials have been almost completely ignored in the literature. As with their temporal counterparts, I will assume that distance for-adverbials form measure phrases, i.e. serve to introduce the composed-of mapping. By making this natural assumption, we may then explain the curious fact that * Jack ran to the bridge for two miles is horrible, in sharp contrast to both Jack ran two miles to the bridge and Jack ran along the river for two miles. This is illustrated below:

The guided reflection on the challenges and opportunities of cybernetics and systems research (CSR) included initial interventions by panelists Peter Erdi, Helena Knyazeva, Stefan Thurner, Peter Csermely, and Alexander Laszlo. Afterwards, the floor was opened to interventions from the general public and further interventions by panelists.
For efficient introduction of the power, mode matching between input and inner field is critical. We aim to introduce > 50% of the input power into the cavity with the Gaussian converter and the focusing lens by matching beam waist position, beam size, beam position, and the transverse beam shape of the input power to those of the cavity. For the best maching, we monitor the input, reflected, and accumulated power with pyroelectric power monitors located upstream and downstream of the cavity. Final optimization is now ongoing.

Observed periods of the order of an hour require the newly discovered sdB variables to be gravity mode pulsators. Preliminary calculations show that high radial order g-modes are needed to produce the range of periods observed in PG 1716+426. The κ mechanism that has been so successful for understanding p-mode pulsations in EC 14026 stars (Charpinet et al. 1997; Brassard et al. 2001) does not appear to be capable of driving such deep pulsational modes. The g-mode driving mechanism is therefore unknown.

The most important effect of the spot in RV is due to the fact that it suppresses the flux emitted by a portion of the rotating stellar disk, thus introducing a perturbation to the disk-averaged RV. Provided c is not close to one, this perturbation can be estimated simply by multiplying the projected area of the spot, which is given by F(t), by the RV of the stellar surface at the location of the spot:

The position of the non-stretched line will be given by the equation L = 2πR(Y). Assuming that we are dealing with a thin slab so that this line of no stretching is in the exact middle of the slab, we obtain the equation L = 2πR(W/2) which can be solved for R0. For a thick slab, the exact value of R0 will depend on nonlinear elastic parameters and will be difficult to estimate a priori. However, the arguments still show that the inner layers of the slab will be thickened when bent into an annulus.

The value of the Fourier transform of s(t) at the frequency f is a measure of the degree to which s(t) varies like a sinusoid of frequency f.

where p(I, t) is the probability for a walker to be in the class I initially and at time t. Stability measures the quality of a partition by giving a positive contribution to communities from which a random walker is unlikely to escape within the given time scale t. For small values of t, this gives more weights to small communities whereas for larger values of t, larger communities are favored. Thus, by searching the partitions maximizing the stability for several values of t, one can detect communities at several scales.

Our activation and binding energy calculations show that bromophenyl functionalization is selective with respect to nanotube size and metallicity: functionalization of smaller and/or metallic nanotubes is thermodynamically favored. However, this selectivity is stronger for smaller nanotubes while the experimental tubes are relatively large. Therefore, it may be challenging to observe this selectivity in experimental samples, due to others factors becoming of equal importance as compared to the diameter, such as the family of the nanotube.

In this contribution I have discussed a novel approach to the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleon in the timelike regime. I have shown that existing data on proton induced dilepton production on light nuclei seem to be in gross disagreement with predictions based on a naive VMD picture. Based on results of a microscopic model I have argued that this disagreement may be due to off-shell effects on the form factors. I have also indicated that it may be difficult to disentangle the effects of the strong interaction and the electromagnetic interaction vertices in nucleon-nucleon collisions.

In this context, users and products can be modeled as nodes of a bipartite graph, while purchases or clicks are modeled as edges.

Overfitting in a game sense refers to the poor performance of a GPP P when P seems to be strong according to a given criterion which was used in the design of P. For instance, a GPP built through trials and errors by accepting any modifications which increase the success rate against a GPP X might have an excellent success rate against X, but a poor winning rate against another program Y. This is a case of overfitting.

Clearly, this simple Newtonian system has no direct relation with glassy systems. Nevertheless, it might be possible that there exists a variable representing the time correlation function for a glassy system that obeys an equation similar to that in the example discussed above. Such a variable would provide a characterization of the non-ergodic transition in that glassy system. Beginning from this speculation, in this paper, we determine such a variable and derive its evolution equation from a many-body Langevin model, employing several assumptions. We demonstrate that the obtained equation indeed does exhibit a non-ergodic transition.

Before proceeding, let us specify the framework and the metric that we are going to use. The cosmological principle, i.e., the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy of the Universe, implies that there should be no preferred point in the Universe. This is obtained when the spatial part of the metric has a constant curvature. The Robertson-Walker metric is the most general metric that merits these properties even if c0 is replaced by c(t), i.e.,

The use of effective theories is one of the primary modus operandi of modern physics. Frequently the effective models give only a qualitatively accurate description of the phenomena under investigation, due to corrections that are omitted and free parameters that may be hard to determine experimentally. Finding experimental systems that display striking phenomena, are accurately described by a simple model, and have few or no free parameters, is important since it enables detailed comparison between experiments, theory and numerical simulations.

then all of the lattice sums are absolutely convergent and the forces generated by Emp are periodic with the lattice. Because of this, the value of the energy is not affected by the definition of the unit cell. In fact, Emp is the same as the Ewald energy if the same lattice limits are used in both cases, and the surface charge distributions generated by each method are identical.
The reionization of the universe is a crucial event in cosmic history. Identifying the source(s) responsible for reionization will allow us to understand the underlying physics.

Assuming that the domination numbers of G(U) and G(V) are defined, the above result implies that the domination number of G(U) is greater than or equal to the domination number of G(V) for any non zero and non simple R-submodule U of V. In the next result we see a case in which a converse inequality holds.
We measured tree heights with a clinometer and recorded to nearest meter. Maximum water level was measured using the still visible line of water on objects surrounding the tree, such as houses or fences. We identified (Herman & Chaput 2003) to the level of genera and measured 288 trees.
Also, let us make the convention that Roman letters i, j, k run from 1 to 2m and Greek letters α, β, γ run from 3 to 2m.
The second constraint from consistency with the standard cosmology model is that the energy density in the early Universe cannot be too large, otherwise too much helium will be produced. In our scenario, all of the charged tau neutrinos will continue to annihilate until the temperature drops below about 0.01 to 2.5 MeV (depending on the mass of the tau neutrino) so that during nucleosynthesis their numbers are heavily depleted relative to the number of relativistic species. Thus, our scenario has the novel feature that there can be effectively only 2 (plus a fraction) neutrinos (depending on its mass and charge) present during nucleosynthesis.

(iii) The dI/dV spectra show systematic magnetic field dependence and the spectral features disappear at Hc of a given point-contact: In order to inspect the validity of this point we show the magnetic field dependence of an Pd/Pb0.6Sn0.4 Te point-contact spectrum in Figure 2(b). As expected for superconducting point-contacts, the spectrum shows a monotonic decrease in the spectral features with increasing magnetic field. Beyond a critical magnetic field of 5 T, the spectrum becomes featureless and that is the critical magnetic field for the superconducting point-contact. The magnetic field dependence of the critical current is demonstrated in the inset of Figure 2(b).

Our results motivate a population level understanding of stem cells. Because of heterogeneity and complex dynamics, static gene-expression profiles provide limited insight into stem cell phenotypes. Study of population epigenetics and population dynamics of stem cells can bring fresh insight into the delicate interplay that occurs in homeostatic cycling tissues.
It should be mentioned that in case of induced moments the adiabatic approximation might not be valid at all. For this reason, in our implementation only the good moment constituents are described according to DLM, whilst induced moments are treated within usual SDFT. Though the orientation of the induced moments can be determined self-consistently, for ferromagnetic systems we kept it parallel to the average magnetization of the good moments. For antiferromagnetic alloys like FeRh the induced moment of Rh converged to zero.

VC2 is a poorer region than VC1 both in HI and optical, with a factor of 1.8 fewer HI detections per square degree in VC2 compared to VC1. Other regions within the cluster show even greater differences, so the difference is low enough to be readily explained by normal variance within the cluster. The number of background HI detections in each region is consistent. The low number of detections in this region is therefore not a result of poor source extraction methods, despite the high S/N level of the detections. Indeed, the HI mass distribution from AGES shows a greater fraction of objects in the low-mass bins than other shallower surveys.

Introduction
According to standard mathematics, the coefficients Mlm(t) can be fully determined if the magnetic field is known at the boundary of the volume where the field equations are considered, in this case the LCA. This data is of course not available to us, since we only know B in four points of the boundary, where the magnetometers are. Therefore the question we need to address is: how many terms of the series can we possibly determine on the basis of the limited information available? Or, equivalently, how many multipole coefficients can we estimate, given the magnetometers readout data? Then, also, to which accuracy can we estimate the actual magnetic field after the maximum number of multipole coefficients have been calculated?

We have shown that templates corresponding to broken-power law spectra have the necessary fitting-factor (i.e. greater than 97%) for a wide class of models and that the total number of filters required to carry out a search using the data from first generation laser interferometer is sufficiently small not to produce a large computational burden.

For lattice calculations in which the topological charge tunnels frequently, the distribution of Q will be well-sampled, and χt can be estimated simply from the empirical sample variance, or from a least-squares (LS) fit of a Gaussian to the Q distribution. The advantage of the ML method is that it should still yield robust estimates of χt even when the distribution is relatively poorly sampled. However, in extreme cases where the number of observed tunneling events is O(10) or less, the uncertainty in χt can become very large, as a lack of tunneling events can be explained by either large χt and small η, or vice-versa. Marginalizing over η leads to essentially a lower bound on χt.

Conclusion
In the general case we have the ground state of the continuum which can always be described in terms of the elastic field. In the ground state, this field has some definite value which does not depend on the point of the elastic continuum. The different fluctuation of elastic field which mean value is zero present the ground state too. To consider the elastic field that determines this continuum, we have to describe possible deformations of the distribution of this field which become dependent on the point of this continuum. The elastic field may be characterized by various geometrical objects, i.e., a scalar if this field describes the phase transition in a condensed matter (liquid, liquid crystal, the wave function in the superconductivity), a vector potential in electrodynamics, a second-rank tensor in the general relativity etc. The basic concept is that in any system with local broken continuous symmetry exist states in which the elastic variables describe distortions of spatial configurations of the ground state. These distortions arise if the continuous symmetry of the elastic-field distribution is broken in a local area. The first way to break the continuous symmetry is to introduce a foreign inclusion in the elastic matter. Then the long-range interaction between inclusions is determined by the symmetry of the deformation of the elastic field. This deformations are produced by the boundary conditions on the inclusions. Then interaction expressed in terms of the characteristics of this inclusion. In a system with broken continuous symmetry also can exist defects in the elastic-field distribution, i.e., the topological defects. In the general case, each topological defect has some core region, where the elastic-field distribution is strongly destroyed, and a far-field region where the elastic variable slowly changes in space. Both inclusions and topological defects are foreign to the elastic field and can not be described in terms of this field. Nevertheless they must have characteristics which influence on the ground state of the elastic continuum. This characteristics determine the value and character of the deformation. Then the amount value of various elastic deformations can be associated with the effective interaction between inclusions. In other words, the presence of the field deformation immediately leads to the interaction. Such interaction did not need the carrier. Interaction of other type determined by the changes of the global deformation of elastic field can arise only when inclusions changing or moving.
Under the regime of this genericity philosophy we shall now show the following theorem (or lemma):
Then
This state is not degenerated for the fixed quantum numbers S, S3, Q, Q3.
In the above line elements, the coordinate time coincides with the proper time of an observer at infinity. However, since one wishes to evaluate the ground to orbit clock synchronization, it is advantageous to rewrite the metric in terms of a rescaled time coordinate, which coincides with the proper time of clocks at rest on the surface of the Earth; this is best implemented by resorting to the above-mentioned geoid, since its definition as an equipotential surface Φ = Φ0 indicates that all clocks at rest with respect to it will beat at the same rate; hence, rescaling the time coordinate according to t → (1 + Φ0/c2)t, one gets the metric given by the line element

Despite the potential difficulty just described, we conclude that it is possible in principle for atmospheric structures like those predicted by hydrodynamic models of Miras to account for the lack of red peaks in observed Mg II profiles from these pulsating stars. Further modeling is needed to confirm these results, and to find a model which accurately reproduces the profiles of both Mg IIh & k and of the less optically thick Fe II and Al II] lines. In addition, future modeling could combine hydrodynamic modeling and a more sophisticated treatment of the radiative transfer in a self-consistent manner.

While many aspects of solar neutrinos will have been well investigated by the time an Indian effort can be mounted, there are some further areas which will remain uninvestigated. An example would be the measurement of the higher energy tail of the solar neutrinos, in the range of 13-17 MeV where Hep neutrinos can be measured, and where SuperK, the presently largest instrument planned, will not have accumulated good statistics. Typical number of events at a 1 kT on water Cerenkov detector are given in Appendix A. The effects of cuts on the minimum energy of detection (of the recoil electron) are shown in Table 1 in the Appendix.

We have considered self-similar nonlinear perturbation from the Friedmann solution and investigated the asymptotic properties of spherically symmetric self-similar solutions containing a scalar field with potential and approaching the flat Friedmann solution at spatial infinity. The potential is restricted from self-similarity to be exponential with the steepness parameter λ. This is motivated by the fact that a scalar field with sufficiently flat (0 < λ2 < 2) potential enables the universe to expand with acceleration and hence acts as quintessence.

This equation is sufficiently regular and does not allow for existence of a trap for any value of M, so consistently with energy considerations, no blow-ups are possible in this case. For d ≥ 3, a similar reasoning shows that a trap of an arbitrarily small mass may exist. So the interesting case is d = 2.

Suppose now that the composition length of V is 3, and that V has a unique maximal submodule J. Then, every proper submodule of V is inside J. As the composition length of J is 2, every proper submodule of V different from J is simple. Consequently, G(V) is the star K1, c, where J is adjacent to all the other vertices (= all the proper submodules of J), and there are no edges between the vertices other than J, and c denotes the cardinality of the set of all the proper submodules of J. Hence, we have observed in both cases that there are no cycles.

Introduction
Two-step experiment assumes both measurement and comparison of the measured and calculated with the tested functions ρ = ψ(Eex) and k = φ(Eγ) emission probability of two correlated reaction products. There can be two gamma-quanta or particle and gamma-quantum. The function shape for probability distribution of their registration with the determined parameters in one- and two-step reactions is different. Just this difference causes different value of systematical uncertainties of measured nuclear parameters and high resulting reliability of their values in two-step reaction.
The results which have been obtained as part of the stability analysis are also helpful for analysing various features of the density fluctuation spectrum. We therefore take the opportunity, whilst the results are to hand, of giving some formulae which might be useful for observational tests of warm inflation.
Because instruction sequence notations are quite low level it may be the case that faults are spread over a set of instructions in a less coherent fashion than would have been the case for programs written in a high level program notation. Thus. assuming that inferring a fault from an observed failure or error is a major obstacle, that obstacle may be smaller in a high level program notation, which may be considered to constitute a disadvantage of instruction sequence based research on software testing.
Since the location of the horizons are slightly different for odd and even dimensions it will be convenient in the next section to analyze these cases separately.
ARCADE 2 determines the radiometric temperature of the sky by using a full-aperture blackbody external calibrator as an absolute temperature reference. To function as a blackbody emitter, it should have very low power reflection across the entire ARCADE 2 frequency range. The emitting surfaces of the external calibrator need to be close to isothermal, and, while located on the carousel at the top of an open bucket dewar, have to be precisely temperature controlled within the range of 2.5 K to 3.1 K.

Despite the achievements described above, the lack of experimental data over a wide range of x and Q2 values seriously limits the accuracy with which polarized PDFs can be determined. Several issues in our knowledge of the nucleon longitudinal spin structure are hence left completely open, as summarized below.
We conclude that the sparsity-sampling relation revealed by the phase diagram in the noise-free case is robust to low levels of Gaussian noise. For medium and high levels of noise, the phase diagram shows that a sharp transition continues to hold (for the particular noise considered) but the location of the transition changes to require more data for accurate reconstruction.

In the absence of viruses, hosts exhibit logistic growth with exponential growth rate ri and a community-wide carrying capacity K. To simplify the model we assume that for a given host, intrastrain and interstrain competition are the same. The parameters φj and βj are the adsorption rate and burst size (virion release per infection) of virus j (which we assume is independent of host i). Virus j decays outside the host at a rate mj. M denotes the infection matrix, where Mij = 1 if virus j can infect host i and Mij = 0 if virus j cannot infect host i. For analytical tractability, there are several characteristics of the life cycle of a viral infections that are not included in this model. For example, we assume there is no delay between infection and virion release. We also do not include the possibility of lysogeny, where viral genetic material is incorporated into the host chromosome and vertically transmitted to daughter cells for future activation and lysis.

The ratio of detections to sites with 6035-MHz emission was 8 out of 38, while for the 1720-MHz it was 2 out of 12, both of which also have 6035-MHz emission. This draws into doubt the claimed predictive power of 1720-MHz, though with few detections the statistics are not compelling.
The present experiments suggest that one factor controlling the propensity of a reactive mixture to support fast flames is its ability to generate vorticity by hydrodynamic instabilities. These appear to be favored in mixtures with a lower isentropic exponent, for which density changes are more significant. The experiments have shown that such hydrodynamic instabilities may couple with the reactive field when auto-ignition is possible in discrete regions. The punctuated reaction of these spots permits to drive the pressure fluctuations and shock amplitude changes conducive to more instabilities.
Even though limited to the extreme ends of the valid interval, the probability of getting a non-valid response may be pretty high, even larger than 50%.

Course Structure
We have chosen to implement our code in the C++ programming language. This choice is motivated by considerations such as modularity of design, flexibility, efficiency, ease of code reuse, and extensibility. For example, using the object-oriented paradigm in the C++ language has allowed us to maintain a clean separation between interfaces and implementations (e.g., for the equation of state, Poisson equation solver, and initial conditions etc.), and features such as templates have allowed us to write generic code without sacrificing runtime performance.
The equations of motion are solved by a fifth order predictor-corrector scheme. In the course of stretching, the native contacts are being ruptured. A contact between amino acids i and j is said to be ruptured if the corresponding distance rij becomes larger than 1.5σij (close to the inflection point of the Lennard-Jones potential) for the last time. When studying folding, we consider establishing contacts starting from an unfolded state. A contact is said to be established when the corresponding value of rij crosses the threshold value for the first time. Folding is considered to be achieved when all contacts are established simultaneously.

This comes in addition to the natural increase of parameter uncertainty. Bias in the intercept coefficients imply incorrect predicted probabilities for the levels of the response, whereas bias for parameter estimates associated with the regression covariates may erroneously attenuate or highlight an effect, thus leading to misinterpretations related to the importance of a given predictor on the longitudinal dynamics of the ordinal response.

Of course, the point of these numbers is not to argue that any such quantum corrections are likely to be detected in the forseeable future. Rather, the small size of these quantum corrections instead show that the experimental great success of classical General Relativity in the solar system can also be considered a great success of quantum gravity! Classical calculations are not a poor substitute for some poorly-understood quantum theory, they are rather an extremely good approximation for which quantum corrections are exceedingly small.

The super-cluster is placed on an eccentric orbit with perigalacticon at 2.1 kpc and apogalacticon at 7.5 kpc. The orbit is inclined such that the maximum Z-distance from the disc plane is about 2 kpc. The parameters are chosen to be representative of the knots seen to contain many star clusters in the Antennae galaxies, while the orbital inclination is motivated by the orbit of ω-Cen (Dinescu et al. 1999). The host galaxy is represented by an analytical potential, which consists of a disc modelled as a Plummer-Kuzmin potential and a spherical halo component modelled as a logarithmic potential:

Nevertheless, the metallicity data give values somewhat higher than what might be naively expected from the Local Group hypothesis. Furthermore, all but one of the HVCs that have been measured are in the southern hemisphere where there may be some confusion with MS gas; the interpretation of the origin of the metallicities is therefore not unambiguous one way or the other as Gibson (this volume) points out. As is true for the Hα test, it would be useful to have some of the small, high negative velocity clouds near M31 measured, but finding suitable background sources is difficult.

Preliminaries
The physical conditions inferred from the absorption features caused by high redshift damped Lyα absorption systems (DLAS) are, in several aspects, similar to those in the interstellar medium of present-day galaxies. It has therefore been suggested to identify DLAS with the progenitors of such galaxies (e.g. Wolfe 1988). At low redshift DLAS show a wide variety of morphologies (Le Brun et al. 1997). At high redshift, however, few have been detected in emission (Møller & Warren 1995; Warren & Møller 1995, Djorgovski et al. 1996, Djorgovski 1997, Møller & Warren 1998) and the nature of galaxies causing the absorption remains unclear for the majority of DLAS at high redshift. The main source of information on the nature of DLAS comes from the associated metal absorption which probes the kinematics and the chemical enrichment history of the mainly neutral gas in these systems. Motivated by the characteristic asymmetric shape of the absorption profiles of low ionization species Wolfe and collaborators (e.g. Wolfe 1986) have suggested that high-redshift DLAS are large rapidly rotating discs akin to present-day spiral galaxies (but see also Ledoux et al. 1998). In this picture the generally low observed metallicity of high redshift DLAS (Pettini 1994, Lu 1996, Pettini 1999) is taken as evidence that these are still chemically young (Lindner, Fritze-von Alvensleben & Fricke 1999).

This modification must take into account the Lorentz invariance violation intrinsic in the M-P model. As it was mentioned in the introduction, we are only interested in this low energy regime because it is the relevant one for a theory which must be seen as an effective theory parametrizing new features of space-time structure which may come from a more fundamental theory.

The time basis measurements are not affected by the decoherence-induced reduction of the visibility contrast; in contrary the energy bases measurements are. An intuitive picture of how the decoherence affects the time-bin entanglement is the following: the pump interferometer phase, φP, is transferred onto the quantum dot by means of resonant excitation. Any incoherence in the process of resonant excitation as well as in relation between the ground and the biexciton state will have as a consequence an averaging of the transferred phase, and thus of the phase of the entangled state. This will reduce the visibility contrast as well as decrease the values of entanglement measures and indicators like concurrence and fidelity.

We now turn to generalizing this discussion to two-dimensional aperture fields h = h(x, y). The main difference between the one-dimensional channel and the two-dimensional fracture is that flow can in the latter case easily bypass regions of small aperture. They do not play the crucial role here as they did in the one-dimensional channel.

Conclusions
In general, the expansions will have this structure, i.e., they can be divided in a few pieces, each one consisting in a series of negative integer powers of λ, multiplied by a rational power of λ. For this reason, the approximants that we will build must also be divided in a similar way, in order to match the behavior of each piece. This will be seen explicitly in the next two sections.

New H-band Galaxy Number Counts: A Large Local Hole in the Galaxy Distribution?
The integrated intensity map, proportional to the column density, is shown in figure 1; many filamentary structures are apparent. The filaments stand out in individual channel maps and most of them can be followed over several channels. The strongest filament (a on figure 1) crosses most of the field in an east-west direction. There are also two fainter filamentary structures (b and c) that seem to merge (in spatial and velocity space) in the brighter part of filament a. A closer look at these filaments in individual channel maps reveals smaller elongated substructures, parallel to the main axis.

Conclusion
In conclusion the adhesion of the pentylamine is reliable only on surfaces with a high enough density of carbon atoms that can bind with the ions/radicals produced during the glow discharge sticking the pentylamine to the surface. In this case the deposition of DNA molecules is reproducible and molecules are not overstretched. The role of the carbon atoms is only to anchor the pentylamine layer. Hence it is not necessary to form a continuous carbon coating of the substrate. For example the Pt/C samples produced by D. Klinov were obtained by simultaneous evaporation of both Platinum and Carbon in unknown proportions. (However in the transport devices for measurement of DNA transport the nature of the substrate will not be relevant since the active region will be contaminated by carbon from the focused ion beam microscope).

We focus on the a-Cr0.14Si0.86:H sample with optimal magnetic properties. The ferromagnetism is clearly seen in Fig. 2(a) at both 10 K and 300 K. The saturation magnetization is 0.23 emu/cm3 and the coecivity is about 100 Oe at room temperature. Both the field-cooled (FC) and the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization were measured from 350 K down to 10 K. The crossing point of FC and ZFC curves, serving as a rough estimate for Curie temperature, is clearly above room temperature. In addition, we also measured the Hall resistivity by PPMS in the presence of perpendicular magnetic field up to 3.5 Tesla at T = 5 K. As shown in Figure 2(c), the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is manifest, hinting the ferromagnetic order is mediated by charge carriers.

Both of these limitations are overcome by a remarkable algorithm based on dynamic programming, that was suggested by Brendan McKay. This algorithm was incorporated into a program, latticego.c, that is run against a set of lattices. No equation is given to the program; instead, the program tells the user the first n for which n-Go fails or whether it passes for all n. The program runs very quickly, depending only on the size of the input lattice, with a run time proportional to the fourth power of the lattice size, rather than increasing exponentially with n as with the lattice g.c that checks against arbitrary equations.

Our use of an unattended experiment led to several complications that we had not anticipated. For example, we were often confronted with multiple subjects simultaneously taking part in the experiment or advising one another on how to correctly complete the task at hand. A technical solution to this problem would be an enclosed experimental area whose access is restricted to entry by a single person only (e.g., through a controlled turnstile). Unfortunately, this would be in violation of fire safety regulations. We therefore plan to explicitly instruct participants that the experiment is intended to be conducted by a single subject at a time, and to verify and penalize non-compliance, e.g., by denying reward to non-compliant subjects.
The analysis is performed in three steps: 1) determination of the optimal on-off fluorescence threshold; 2) preselection of detection times around each fluorescence jump; 3) detection of the first (last) photon associated to the fluorescence jump.

Observation and Data Selection
The second-order magnetic phase transition near the Curie point is characterised by a set of critical exponents, β (associated with the spontaneous magnetisation), γ (associated with the initial susceptibility) and δ (related to the critical magnetisation isotherm). They are defined as14

Joint Fluctuation Effect
The systems which represent classical and intuitionistic logics have often been studied separately. For each of these logics we establish its proper properties. Although the systems which represent intuitionistic logic are sub-systems of those which represent classical logic, we usually do not find in the literature studies of the properties of these systems at the same time. We mainly find many external translations from classical to intuitionistic logic. The main novelty of the system which we look for is that intuitionistic and classical logics appear as fragments. For instance a proof of an intuitionistic formula may use classical lemmas without any restriction. This approach is radically different from the one that consists in changing the rule of the game when we want to change the logic. We want only one logic which, depending on its use, may appear classical or intuitionistic.
To illustrate the methodology presented here, we analyzed a bank loan survival data, in order to assess the propensity to fraud in loan applications. In this scenario, information from fraudsters is exploited through the joint modelling of the survival time of fraudsters, which is equal to zero, along with the survival times of the remaining portfolio. The results showed the new model performed very well.

Quasiprimitivity and Simple Right Loop
Unification schemes, cosmological models, and quantum theories of gravity indicate that certain variations to the value of certain fundamental physical constants are possible but, unfortunately, they cannot supply us with quantitative details. Neither the hierarchy of the expected variation rates of the different fundamental constants is understood, nor is the form of the dependence clear. Is it a space or time variation? Is it a nearly linear drift or does it oscillate? Without responding to these basic questions we are not in a position to find out what is the most sensitive way to search for possible variations.

It appears that the compactification of a large extra dimension can lead to assistance effects enhancing the probabilities for inflation not only in the case of power-law potentials but in the case of exponential potentials as well.

We close this section with a table demonstrating how the many different realisations of the curvaton scenario could be distinguished using multiple non-Gaussian observables. This has provided us with a concrete realisation of how powerful an observation of non-Gaussianity would be, as well as how even the current constraints without a detection provide interesting information about the curvaton.

By inspection, we see that there is no median vertex in P3 × H3 for (v1, x), (v3 , y), (v1 , z), and by the previous observation, there can be no median in G × H.

Quarks are bound together into hadrons by the strong force. This is observed to occur in two ways: a quark can bind to an antiquark to form a meson or antimeson, and three quarks or antiquarks can bind together to form a baryon or antibaryon. Bare quarks, as well as combinations of quarks other than those just mentioned, have never been observed and are presumed to be forbidden by the laws governing the strong force. (The possible existence of hadrons made up entirely of gluons is a subject of current experimental investigation but has not been definitively established.)

The zero point of the FP depends on the cosmological effects (surface brightness dimming and the value of q0), and the evolution of the galaxies. The FP can in principle be used to test for the expansion of the Universe (Kjærgaard et al. 1993). In the following we correct the data for the expansion of the Universe, and we assume q0 = 0.5. The FP shown in Figure 3 is corrected for the expansion of the Universe. The zero point of the FP can then be used to study the mean evolution of the galaxies in the clusters. Figure 5 shows the zero point differences between the intermediate redshift clusters and the Coma cluster as the offset in the M/L ratio.

For sample sorting every sample key is augmented into a record that includes this additional tag information (array index and sequence identifier storing the key). Since sample size is o(1) of the input keys, the memory overhead incurred is small, as is the corresponding computational overhead. The attached tag information is used in step 2 to form the sample and in sample sorting/merging and then in splitter selection, and finally in step 4, as all these steps require distinct keys to achieve stability. In step 4 in particular, a binary search operation of a splitter key into the locally sorted keys involves first a comparison of the two keys, and if the comparison is not resolved that way the use of sequence identifiers or array indexes as well. If merging is used instead, a similar resolution applies. In the multi-way merging of the Merging phase, stability is resolved by the merging algorithm itself. The computation overhead of duplicate handling that is described by this method is within the lower order terms of the analysis and therefore, the optimality claims still hold unchanged. The results on key imbalance still hold as well. This same duplicate handling method is also used in SqRan.
In order to reveal the time-varying dynamics of the clustering structure, we proposed a method for adjusting the observed correlation matrices to remove the effects of both sector membership and geography separately. After making this adjustment, the effect that both factors have on the clustering becomes much clearer. This allows the clustering structure to be studied over time. Our analysis reveals that between the years of 2003 and 2008, companies located in the same country did not tend to cluster together. However after the 2008 financial crisis this pattern changed, and geography started to become an important determinant of the clustering. This is especially the case in the countries which were hit hardest by the crisis, such as Spain and Italy.

The conjunction of these two ideas leads us Majorana zero modes. In a particle interpretation, the quanta associated to these modes are zero-mass Majorana particles. Since they are localized on specific points, they can be considered as particles in 0 + 1 (0 space, 1 time) dimension. They are in many respects the most extreme Majorana (self-conjugate) particles, consistent with their origin as mid-gap states in superconductors, where the electron Majorana mass is most dominant. They are not quite fermions, as we shall see, but obey an interesting generalization of Fermi statistics. It will be convenient to have a name for such particles. In view of their smallness both in mass and in spatial extension, and their extreme Majorana character, the name Majorino suggests itself, and I shall adopt it here.

We found He 2-36 to exhibit extended emission only, whereas He 2-84 and Th 2-B exhibit only a compact central source. Mz 3 show both compact and extended emission. No emission was detected from He 2-25. For He 2-84 and Th 2-B, we applied the task IMFIT to the clean map and UVFIT to the visibility data to determine the flux densities of their radio cores. In both cases, we assumed their radio cores to have a two-dimensional Gaussian structure. For Mz 3, the flux density was obtained only for the bright compact core in the clean map, as can be seen in Figure 1. The results are listed in Table 3.

We note that the near-field images are repeatable when taken in five minute sequences over the same sample area and at a fixed temperature because they show nearly identical patterns of metallic puddles in the insulating host (see Appendix B). This indicates that the possible effect of dynamic fluctuations on the static patterns is small. This is discussed in detail in Appendix B.

There are various ways to interpret this equality of moduli spaces.
In summary, we have obtained a simple way of s-ordering of operators. This is specially suitable for evaluating product of ordered operators, as well as ordering transformations. Indeed, we have re-derived and generalized some elementary quantum optical identities in a simple fashion. We have shown that some of the previous ordering identities have simple combinatorial meanings. We have also represented the extent of our method through a simple example.

As a typical test particle is integrated over the course of a simulation its semimajor axis a and eccentricity e remain constant. We discover a nodal libration mechanism in the inclination i and longitude of the ascending node W of all inclined orbits.

For many Monte Carlo simulations, as is the case for the transfer matrix of the Ising model, the particle weights defining the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue can be made all positive. The second eigenfunction however must be represented by some particles of negative weight and some particles of positive weight. For some jumps these negative and positive weights must at least partially cancel to maintain a correct estimation of the second eigenfunction. When N ≪ M, as is typical, this cancellation does not occur often enough in a Monte Carlo simulation without proper design.

The value c4/4G of the force limit is the energy of a Schwarzschild black hole divided by twice its radius. The maximum power c5/4G is realized when such a black hole is radiated away in the time that light takes to travel along a length corresponding to twice the radius. It will become clear below why a Schwarzschild black hole, as an extremal case of general relativity, is necessary to realize these limit values.
As done previously we can rewrite the difference of Θ functions as follows:
Actual theories might predict a specific phase relation so that there is less opportunity for a look-elsewhere effect. To study this possibility let us simply assume φP = φB = φ and look for the maximum amplitude found for any common phase φ so that in this case

This dispatch approach is particularly adapted to a HPC data-analysis work-flow: a repetitive concurrent access to a limited set of hosts exploits at the best the session recycling and maximizes the lifetime of the TCP connections. However, contrary to a pure multi-plexing solution that aims to the usage of one TCP connection per host, our approach uses a connection pool whose size is proportional to the level of concurrency. Consequently, an important degree of concurrency can result in a more important server load compared to a multi-plexed solution like spdy due to the number of connections allocated per client.

A breaktrough in high pressure experimental techniques occured near the middle of this century (Lawson and Tang, 1950; Jamieson et al, 1959; Weir et al., 1959) with the invention of the diamond anvil cell (DAC). The first DACs were built with the aim of performing high pressure x-ray diffraction studies and infrared absorption measurements under high pressure. Later evolution, described in detail in the literature (such as Jayaraman,1983,1986;Williams and Jeanloz,1991; Angel et al.,1992; Itie 1992) has converted the DAC into a versatile quantitative tool for physical research.

It is often desirable to present quantitative results in both color and grayscale formats. In the black-and-white or grayscale format, an interval of numerical values maps to a scale of grays which increase uniformly in lightness. Color is usually represented as a three-dimensional object, and could thus be used to represent a three-dimensional region of numerical values. More typically, a color scale is used to represent a one-dimensional interval of numerical values. Colors are usually easier to distinguish than grays because of the additional dimensions along which colors vary. Thus a color scale is generally preferable to a gray scale.

One of the most relevant properties of a learning algorithm is its speed of convergence. For each method, we computed the average reward over the last 500 episodes of the training episodes, and compared it to the average across the 500 episodes preceding those. If the average was within 10%, we considered the method to have converged. The percentage of converged trails out of those that finished for each method was: SARSA: 85%; AC: 80%; ETTR: 84%; GQ: 80%; Q: 82%; R: 85%. The convergence rates are very similar across the methods considered. These results also suggests that the step size constants that we chose were reasonable.

However things are not that simple. First, simulations show that only a fraction of the gas supply falls on the BH, the rest being released in a bipolar outflow, owing to the high thermal energy content of the hot gas (and probably also because the thick structure facilitates the collimation of the jet, like at the other extreme the thick discs in strong accretors). Second, ADAF models underpredict systematically the low-frequency radio flux of LLAGN, and another component, presumably from a jet, should be added to that emitted by the disc. This is clear when the LLAGN is a FRI radio-galaxy like M87, as the jet is prominent. But is it also the case for radio-quiet LLAGN?

The density in a superbubble depends on a number of parameters, the ambient density into which the bubble expands (itself perhaps porous), the time-dependent power input from H II regions, winds, and supernovae, the evaporation of clouds and of the compressed shell of ambient gas, turbulent attrition of the shell, and the time since the onset of the power input, among others. To represent the density evolution, we adopt the expression from Shull & Saken (1995) for the interior density of the bubble. Shull & Saken assume an isothermal interior in pressure balance and hence derive an interior density loaded by mass evaporation from the shell that is radially constant interior to the bubble shell.

Conclusions
The likelihood of detecting H i SA favours the geometry in which a molecular cloud lies at the near kinematic distance. Since H i exists everywhere throughout the Galaxy, it emits at essentially every allowed velocity. For clouds at the near kinematic distance, there is an ample amount of H i at the far distance and at the same velocity against which a cold molecular foreground cloud can be seen. If the same cloud were placed at the far distance, however, there should be little or no background H i, and the SA feature would be absent. In addition, any weak SA for far clouds would be filled in by emission from warm clouds in the foreground. Note object G291.1881-00.2729 component 1, which is physically solved to be at the far distance, yet shows very slight H iSA features within its spectrum for example.
To compute the value of K(f, S)(x) we need some properties of Cayley-Menger determinant. We recall some definitions and basic results.
It is obvious that Q is onto W0 and is 1-1 on Z. We give W0 the quotient topology. For x = {xi} ∈ A let N(x) be, for the 3 cases of the definition respectively, ∞, n and 0. Then if Q(x) = Q(y), it follows that N(x) = N(y). The map Q is not 1-1 on A.

Self-tuning of hyper-parameters
The non-linear transformation which has just been described can be used to transform non-orthogonal states into orthogonal states, provided two copies of the state are available. By nature, non-orthogonal quantum states can not be distinguished with certainty, and even if this transformation can turn non-orthogonal states into orthogonal states, this does not in any way conflict with quantum mechanics, since there is a certain probability that the transformation fails.
The reason gauge bosons have a definite B and L is because there are only defining representation 15s for the fermions. The 10 in SU(5) is antisymmetric and this couples to gauge bosons with indefinite B and L.
The work presented in this article should naturally be extended in several directions. One should first investigate systematically all QWs on the line defined with a quantum coin acting on a 2D Hilbert space and, for each family of walks, try and determine if and how a continuous limit can be obtained. One should also extend the main result of this article to QWs defined on physical space of higher dimension and/or defined by quantum coins acting on a higher dimensional Hilbert space. A particular goal would be to obtain walks whose limits are described by a Dirac fermion coupled to both a gravitational and an electromagnetic field.
We always denote vector fields in T L by T, S and in T P by X, Y. In addition, we identify vector fields in T L and T P with basic vector fields in T N by taking T(x, y) = T(x) and X(x, y) = X(y).

Finally, if indeed the evolution of magnetic field strengths in galaxies is relatively slow over the last 10 Gyr, then we need RM data on very distant sources. Such measurements can allow us to push back to early enough times to reveal how magnetic fields in galaxies were created and amplified. Deep SKA observations of quasars or gamma-ray burst afterglows at z > 6 can provide information on Faraday rotation at these early epochs.
The steep slope of the power-law model (αp = 2.69) indicates that the synchrotron emission we observe in the Suzaku energy region is above the roll-off frequency of the spectrum extrapolated from the radio regime.

ReLU Units (Convolutional)
Next we give a corollary of this Lemma.
We fit the ASCA spectra from 2-8 keV, in order to compare the same energy range for all our data. A power-law model with a single gaussian (representing the combination of Fe lines) generally gave acceptable fits to the data. We find (omitting 3 CVs with poorly determined indices) a clear difference between the fitted photon indices of the magnetic (mean Γ = 1.22, σ = 0.33) and the nonmagnetic (mean Γ = 1.97, σ = 0.20) ASCA CVs. We find consistency, however, between the average IP and polar spectra, and between the average quiescent dwarf nova spectrum and the average novalike/outbursting dwarf nova spectrum. High-B IPs and polars (e.g. AE Aqr and V884 Her) have suppressed hard X-ray radiation, producing low LXs and photon indices. Excluding these high-B systems, we do not find strong dependence of the photon index with LX within either the magnetic CVs or nonmagnetic CVs as groups.
The chief consequence of our Adams differential calculation is the following results about the stable 51 and 52 stems.
Ironically, one of the most maligned groups of modelers in science, climatologists, have probably proved ahead of many other disciplines in trying to validate their models against measured data from a variety of sources documenting historical temperature trends. In large complex systems, sometimes models may be the only realistic way to proceed and given this one may be inclined to sacrifice elegance for realism in order to present a theory that both reproduces measured data and also proves useful to those in other fields to model and predict data according to their own methodologies.
In addition to the censored regression models, we consider some well-known strategies which can deal with unobservable intensity values at the peak level. The first and simplest alternative strategy we consider is complete case analysis, ignoring thus all censored peak intensities. A simple alternative approach which allows us to use additional information on the unobservable peaks is to reduce all intensity values to the binary information above/below the LOD. Finally, we consider substituting the unobservable peak intensities with the LOD value in order to avoid the loss of information in the observable peaks. For all these alternative methods, we obtain an estimate of the average intensity within cluster by averaging the (available) values. For the complete case analysis, if an entire cluster is unobservable in a sample, we impute the average over the estimates from all patients with at least one observable peak.
Then we obtain

A planar proximity graph is a planar graph where two points are connected by an edge if they are close in some sense. A pair of points is assigned a certain neighbourhood, and points of the pair are connected by an edge if their neighbourhood is empty. Here we consider the most common proximity graph as follows.

Our hope is to find some signature that can distinguish models with universal coupling from models with non-universal coupling. If one were to find traces of a non-universal coupling in observations this would essentially a breaking of the equivalence principle.

The idea of flavor democracy is an elegant one, especially in that it uses one basic idea to explain the largeness of the leptonic angles, the smallness of the quark angles, and the fact that one family is much heavier than the others. On the other hand, it requires the very specific forms given in Eqs. (6) and (7), which come from very specific symmetries. It is in this sense a narrower approach to the problem of fermion masses than some of the others I have mentioned.

Conclusion
A certain generalisation of the above theorem (which will be stated and proved in Section 3) shall be applied in the sequel to prove that certain classes of tuples of operators are p-isomorphic. Roughly speaking, the existence of a p-isomorphism between two classes asserts that these classes have the same Borel (as well as spectral) complexity (p-isomorphisms preserve direct sums of arbitrary collections and prime decompositions). As a main result in this direction we will obtain a theorem stating that the class of all k-tuples (where k is arbitrarily fixed) of closed densely defined linear operators affiliated with finite type I von Neumann algebras is p-isomorphic to the class of all (single) unitary operators.

Now start with a nest of non-intersecting MH-alternating paths through G with endpoints in A. We will create a perfect matching in K by first removing all edges in MH from the paths, removing vertices in A if necessary. The remaining vertices off the path can be matched in only one way, namely with the edges in MH that are not on the path. If there were another way to match those remaining vertices, MH would not be the only perfect matching of H. The bijection is established, so the number of nests of non-intersecting MH-alternating paths is M(K).

The analytical results presented above may be extended to include other parameter variations. Figure 7 illustrates the magnetostatic bias field as a function of te for different values of (a) Ri, (b) L and (c) the width of the spacer, ts. In the range of parameters considered, we observe that an increase in Ri results in an increase of the magnetostatic bias field. Furthermore, an increase of the length, L, produces a decrease of the magnetostatic bias field. Finally, increasing the spacer between the two magnetic layers produces a decrease of the magnetostatic bias field felt by the inner microwire.

If VSD < Vt , then the Fermi level in the drain is above the subband level in the dot and therefore electron cannot flow from the dot to the drain. Consequently, there will be a threshold behavior in the current-voltage characteristic. The current voltage characteristic for Vgb and Vgc are shown in Fig. 4(a).

The shape of a rotation curve is determined largely by the distrbution of luminous and dark mass contained in a spiral galaxy. The correlation found between pitch angle and shear rate, therefore suggests that the main factor determing the tightness of spiral structure, is in fact the central mass concentration. Essentially, a declining rotation curve is indicative of a large central bulge. The correlation between mass concentration and spiral arm pitch angle has been suggested by many theoretical models (e.g. Fuchs 1991, 2000; Bertin et al. 1989a,b; Bertin & Lin 1996).

In conclusion, we proposed a probabilistic neural computing platform that exploits the stochastic device physics of the MTJ to model complex neural transfer functions in the time domain. While the stochasticity of MTJ switching has been traditionally viewed as a disadvantage for logic and memory applications, we demonstrated that such probabilistic switching behavior cannot only lead to high-accuracy cognitive recognition platforms but also provide energy benefits over conventional CMOS designs.

Instead, there should be more courses available to freshmen and nonmajors which exploit some of the breadth of mathematics, to permit starting near the ground level without a lot of repetition of topics that students have already heard.

Throughout our study, we have ignored the effect of electron-electron interaction and the influence of all the inelastic processes. More studies are expected to take into account the Schottky effect which comes from the charge transfer across the metal-molecule interfaces, the static Stark effect resulting from the modification of the electronic structure of the molecular bridge in presence of the applied bias voltage (essential especially for higher voltages).

Before ending this section, it is probably worth to spend few words on some examples of realistic systems where our mapping is at work. In this respect, we would like to note that there are several applications in the literature where fermionic systems, after bosonization, are actually described by a system in interaction with a bosonic bath. This is, for instance, the case of the anisotropic Kondo model, which is shown to be equivalent to a spin-boson model (a two level system in interaction with a bosonic bath). The same is also true for a quantum dot interacting with external leads.

Since Cλi can be viewed as piece-wise continuous boundary data on the domain Di , discontinuous at only two points, we can apply Theorem 2.1. Therefore, for each i, there exists a minimal surface bounded by Cλi . Applying the maximum principle, we see that these solutions are unique, and we call these unique solutions Mλi . For any fixed i, the surface Mλj , for j ≥ i, restricts to a solution of the minimal surface equation over Di. Note that the restriction of Mλj to Di may have different boundary data than Mλi over Di .

One of the most characteristic features of neutrinos in the Standard Model is that weak interactions couple only to left-handed neutrinos, or to right-handed antineutrinos.

We began by considering the action of a topological disturbance on a 2D X-point threaded by a uniform axial field Bz. The initial field is line-tied on all boundary surfaces, and contains no magnetic null but rather a quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) aligned to the tube axis (here the z-axis). The absence of resistive effects means that very large currents can be expected to develop, in response to displacements of the lateral footpoints, over regions delineated by the QSL.

3.2 Implementation
In the years since Mariner 2, many other deep-space missions have added to our understanding of the solar wind. The turbulent inner heliosphere was probed by the two Helios spacecraft, which measured particle and field properties between 0.29 and 1 AU (Marsch 1991). In the 1990s, Ulysses became the first probe to venture far from the ecliptic plane and soar over the solar poles to measure the solar wind in three dimensions (Marsden 2001). The Voyager probes are still sending back data on the outer reaches of the solar wind, and one of them may have passed through the termination shock separating the heliosphere from the interstellar medium (e.g., Krimigis et al. 2003).

We used the Version 2 optical (Williams et al. 1996) and Version 1 Kitt Peak IRIM infrared (Dickinson et al. 1997) images of the Hubble Deep Field. Object finding and photometry were carried out using the PPP faint object photometry package (Yee, 1991), while photometric calibrations were done using the zeropoints provided by the STScI and Kitt Peak HDF teams.
A fundamental problem with fiber bundles is the low fill factor due to the round shape of the fibers and the thick claddings and jackets. We are proposing to remove this problem by placing a matched lenslet array in front of the fiber bundle. The fibers are then at the pupil images of the lenslets making the instrument a pupil spectrograph. Adaptive Optics Associates can manufacture custom lenslets with the desired 150 micron spacing with better accuracy than the fiber bundle. Rectangular lenslets have > 98% fill factor and should have high coupling efficiency. For the infrared, AOA recommends their sapphire substrates with the lenslets formed from infrared transmissive epoxy. AR coatings will be applied to both faces.

The results of spectroscopic study of Ae Herbig star RR Tau are reported. The observations were carried out with a moderate resolution. In accordance with the presented data the Hα line exhibits a double-peaked emission profile. The blue component is weaker than or equal to the red one. Variations of the Hα equivalent width by a factor of 4 - 5 were found. The structure of this line also varies. On JD 2447148 a red absorption reversal of the Hα profile was observed. The Hβ spectral line exhibited both emission and absorption. On JD 2449664 the single-peak emission shifted to the short wavelength range of the underlying absorption line and the red wing of the stellar line looked like a red-shifted absorption component of medium strength. The Hδ line was in absorption. KEY WORDS Young stars, Herbig Ae/Be stars, spectroscopic observations

DISCUSSION & SUMMARY
where
At the borders of the trap (where the condensate density vanishes) and for a given temperature, the non condensate density takes on a finite value which is a quite abrupt behavior. Athough this meets the fact that the thermal cloud is actually surrounding the condensate, it is to by no means conclusive. But this is also a shortocoming of the TF approximation as a whole since it is known to break down at the boundaries of the condensate. Indeed, reinjecting the second derivatives of the densities will certainly entail a more physical behavior.
The next theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a monomial to be indispensable of J.
In this section we calculate the above results in higher orders. To justify our result that no mass is generated for the fermion we may study the Bethe-Salpeter equation obeyed for this propagator. The Dyson-Schwinger equation for the spinor propagator is written as
Further results
There will, however, be occasions where a larger field of view will be desirable so coarser samplings should be considered. Since the front end will consist of a pair of infrared doublets that are of very low cost compared to the overall instrument, we are recommending that a simple turret be used to rotate in different reimaging optics to select different plate scales. We recommend three selectable scales for the instrument of 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 arcseconds per fiber in a three position turret. Good repeatibility of this mechanism is important but not critical since any motion of the lens assemblies would simply change the field of the fiber bundle by a small amount. So no spectral shifts or loss of light would occur due to position errors. The turret also provides the future option that additional scales can be created, and three selected for each run. This would give a powerful non-AO capability to the instrument as well, although there can be significant light loss at the fiber coupling with the coarsest plate scales.

The value of the density of random close packing of granular matter is here exactly found for perfectly spherical monodisperse disks.

Thermal electromagnetic radiation reflects the initial temperature of the system, via quark-antiquark annihilation to virtual photons which decay to lepton pairs, and via quark-gluon Compton scattering. The rate, proportional to T4, should be dominated by the initial temperature, Tinit; the shape of the spectrum will reflect this maximum temperature. Measurements are difficult because of the large lepton and photon backgrounds from hadron decays, hadronic bremsstrahlung, D meson decays and Drell-Yan pairs.
and the approximate
In Section 2 we give the embedding algorithm. In Section 3 we show that the algorithm is correct.
To achieve these results, we use the hypothesis that a first step component separation provides us with: (i) a map of Compton parameters for the TSZ effect of galaxy clusters, and (ii) a map of temperature fluctuations for the primary CMB + KSZ cluster signal. Our method essentially takes benefit from the spatial correlation between KSZ and TSZ effects towards the same galaxy clusters. This correlation allows us to use the TSZ map as a spatial template in order to mask, in the CMB + KSZ map, the pixels where the clusters must have imprinted an SZ fluctuation. In practice a series of TSZ thresholds is defined and for each threshold, we estimate the corresponding KSZ signal by interpolating the CMB fluctuations on the masked pixels. The series of estimated KSZ maps finally is used to reconstruct the KSZ map through the minimisation of a criterion taking into account two statistical properties of the KSZ signal (KSZ dominates over the primary anisotropies at small scales, KSZ fluctuations are non-Gaussian distributed).
Note that the value depends on the order of the products.
Now, we are going to see a picture of the board at the start of the game, this board corresponds to the multiset ({4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2}).
Estimating the autocorrelation function of a stochastic process is a fundamental, though difficult, task that is common across the sciences; oftentimes one has a specific physical or biological model in mind for the mean and autocorrelation functions to fit to. Applying least-squares regression to non-parametric autocorrelation estimates is a ubiquitous practice, partly due to the ease with which this can be done and partly due to comparative point-estimate analyses performed in the geostatistics literature where, as we have shown, conditions of continuity and sample size considered reduce the advantage of ML-based parameter estimation relative to variogram regression.

The discussion above is based entirely on the structure of the Hilbert space formalism and on conditions derived from projective measurements of operator eigenvalues. In particular, it was not based on methods of quantum state reconstruction by tomographically complete sets of measurements, which have often been used as a motivation for the introduction of joint probabilities. It is interesting to note that an expression for joint probabilities can be derived without any reference to joint measurements, only by considering the structure of the operator formalism and its application to separate projective measurements of a and b.

Introduction
From a theory perspective it looks appealing to forbid these terms by some dynamics, without explicitly imposing baryon and lepton number conservation, as it happens in the SM, where baryon and lepton number conservation arise as accidental symmetries from the gauge and Lorentz structure of the theory and its field content (in perturbation theory and barring small effects from possible Majorana masses for neutrinos).
This gives

This method however, has a few weak spots. It is expected that the MITM:
One should note that uncertainty in the outcome or measurement of an event is often not quantum-mechanical in origin. For example, even classically, the angle of elastic scattering of a given proton incident on a target is in practice not predictable, since it is not feasible to measure the position of the proton with respect to the scattering nucleus with sufficient precision to know the impact parameter. Thus even a classical analysis of the problem predicts only the scattering-angle distribution.

In the figure 2 of Croston et al. (2007) it is clear that the wings extends farther than the X-ray emitting shock shells. If wings are deflected hydrodynamic flow of the jets, they can not travel farther than the shock front. Hence, wings are older and shock is associated only with the current (younger than 2.4 Myr) jet activity. This jet is clearly orthogonal to the central minor-axis gas disk (r = 2 kpc). In a case (3C 449) where nuclear dust disk is warped, Tremblay et al. (2006) has discussed about the cause-effect ambiguity between the jet to have shaped the warped dust/gas disk or the reverse. Gopal-Krishna et al. (2010) suggest rotating ISM as a possible cause of wing formation, taking NGC 3801 as an example. As proposed for X-shaped radio galaxies (Gopal-Krishna et al. 2010), it is also possible that a recent binary black hole coalescence may have caused fast (within last 2.4 Myr) change of jet axis in NGC 3801.

would lead to our universe being much younger than it is. The reason for this is that as we increase the energy density in neutrinos, the expansion rate of the universe increases, thus the universe would have evolved to its present state is a much shorter period. This is a statement of flatness. Given the smallness of the spatial curvature, we see that the potential energy is commensurate with the kinetic, thus any increase in the potential energy must result in a faster expansion rate.

Near the boundary the spacetime look like AdS, and consequently we can expand a scalar field as a leading source (J) and a vacuum expectation value term (<O >). We further assume that m21 = m22 < 0. Now when we turn on the source J1 it generates a condensate ψ1(x). The effective mass of ψ2 is given by,
This looks at first like a consistency check rather than a proof. It is, however, perfectly acceptable as a proof in perturbation theory.
To arrive at a flexible and dynamic modeling framework for cell shape and forces, here we choose to work with a CPM. To predict not only shape, but also traction forces of adhering cells, the CPM has to be modified in several regards. For this purpose, we use insights from the TEM to derive an energy functional for single cells on micropatterned substrates. The energy functional is based on the different kinds of tension acting in the cell, which are balanced by the adhesive substrate and manifest as traction force. From our predicted cell shapes, we can extract the traction force for any adhesive geometry in a very efficient manner and in good agreement with experimental results.

We build our work on multimodal embedding methods. However, instead of learning a linear compatibility function, we propose a nonlinear compatibility framework that learns a collection of such linear models making the overall function piecewise linear.
Such points are easily found, for example
A related and important point under consideration concerns the correct modeling of the possible crossover towards homogeneity. If the average density will be ultimately defined one would like to properly describe the transition from a system with large fluctuations (fractal) to a distribution with small fluctuations (homogeneous with small amplitude and correlated fluctuations). A number of statistical tools (correlation function, power spectrum, etc.) can be useful in this respect, but one has to correctly understand some subtle properties due to finite size effects. For example, in a finite sample, the power spectrum will always show a maximum followed by a decay (for k → 0): such a break is due to a finite size effect related to the determination of the average density inside the sample itself. This has been often and incorrectly associated with a real change of the correlation properties of the distribution. Even in the case of a smooth distribution the standard methods used for the characterization of correlation must be carefully revised. This also particularly interesting for the analysis of cosmological N-body simulations which indeed show a smooth transition from small scale fractality to large scale homogeneity.
The RG equations read
which implies the enhancement of the electrical conductivity and the diffusion coefficient.
Force is change of momentum with time; power is change of energy with time. Since both momentum and energy are conserved, all changes take place through a boundary. The force and power limit state that these values are upper limits independently of the boundary that is used. Even if the boundary surface is taken to cross the whole universe, the observed momentum or energy change through that surface is limited by the maximum values. This requires a check with experiments.

We introduce a new Lorentz-violating modification to a scalar quantum field theory. This interaction, while super-renormalizable by power counting, is fundamentally different from the interactions previously considered within the Lorentz-violating standard model extension. The Lagrange density is nonlocal, because of the presence of a Hilbert transform term; however, this nonlocality is also very weak. The theory has reasonable stability and causality properties and, although the Lorentz-violating interaction possesses a single vector index, the theory is nonetheless CPT even. As an application, we analyze the possible effects of this new form of Lorentz violation on neutral meson oscillations. We find that under certain circumstances, the interaction may lead to quite peculiar sidereal modulations in the oscillation frequency.
If deg(b4 , c4 ) ≥ 1, then we have a H3321. So assume that deg(b4 , c4 ) = 0, The total number of edges incident to pairs in {b1 , b2 , b3 } × {c1 , c2 , c3 } is at most 27 (as there are 9 pairs and degree of every pair is at most 3), the remaining at least 10 edges are incident to either b4 or c4. Which implies that there must be at least one pair (say (b3 , c3 )), such that crossing degree sum of (b3 , c3 ) and (b4 , c4 ) is at least 4. Therefore we have that the degree of one crossing pair is at least 2 and that of the other crossing pair is at least 1. These two crossing pairs together with (b1 , c1 ) and (b2 , c2 ) gives us a subgraph isomorphic to H3321.
To summarize our results, we have formulated a new type of vortex mutual friction force, based on the dissipative cutting of flux tubes by fast moving vortices, and have studied its impact on the r-mode instability in superfluid neutron stars. The non-linear dependence of this force with respect to the relative vortex-flux tube velocity leads to a rapid damping of the r-mode above a threshold amplitude at which the vortex array is forced to unpin from the fluxtubes. Effectively, this fluxtube-cutting friction provides a natural saturation mechanism for the r-mode instability.
Such an elementary setting allows to fully characterise the type of stochastic equilibrium attainable when both reproduction and cooperation are at work, and can be given both physical and biological interpretations. In physical terms, reproduction lends itself to be interpreted in terms of crystal growth, whereas mutations can be seen as configurational changes due to thermal noise, such as magnetic spin flips.

We found that a simple system made up of a square array of cross-shaped nanometric holes with slightly anisotropic geometrical properties carved out of a thin supported silver film may display a very strong linear dichroic response for both transmission and reflection. Rotating the direction of polarization of the incoming wave, the transmittance of the system could change from the very small value expected of homogeneous Ag films to an extraordinary transmittance that is about three orders of magnitude larger. Furthermore, the same system but with different geometrical parameters behaves as a quarter wave plate, producing circularly polarized output light for a linearly polarized input field with an helicity that can be controlled by rotating the input polarization direction, although the width of the film is much thinner than the wavelength. Moreover, this behavior may be tuned over a wide frequency range that covers the visible spectrum.

We now comment on the marginal case when M = N. In this case, one expects the satisfying product states, when they exist, to be discrete.

In this case, it is clear that there is a one-to-one correspondence between dimer coverings c of G and product state solutions ψc. The number of product states at the special point φ0 is given by the number of dimer coverings.

Almost all celestial bodies possess a certain magnetism. A substantial fraction of white dwarfs are known to have a magnetic field with strength exceeding 106 G (Chanmugam 1992; Schmidt & Smith 1995; Wickramasinghe & Ferrario 2000). The magnetic moments of these white dwarfs are above 1032 G cm3. For an orbital separation < 1010 cm, these white dwarfs will exert a magnetic field of the order of kG at the surface of their companion stars. As the two white dwarfs in UCDs are in very close proximity, electromagnetic interaction is inevitable. This alters the orbital dynamics of the binary and gives rise to a variety of unusual observational consequences.

The agreement for the entire range of times is special for the KPZ equation: for more general equations, the agreement would break down at sufficiently late times, since the nonlinearities eventually grow exponentially; the exact transformation of the KPZ equation to a linear equation implies that the nonlinearities remain bounded.

A procedure, in which quantum correlations can also be useful, deal with faults of components of a vast computing network. A reliable distributed computing system must be able to cope with a failure of some of its components. A failing component can behave arbitrarily and may send conflicting information to different parts of the computing system.

We have presented a simple, mean-field theory to explain the evolution of this fragile state under applied strain. There are a number of extensions of this work that remain to be considered. Foremost among these is the exploration of the effect of filamin-type cross-linkers in semiflexible gels where the filaments each have a finite bending modulus. In addition, the development of a complete model that includes the effect of internally generated random stresses due to the action of molecular motors will be an important step towards the direct calculation of the low-frequency dynamics of this biopolymer gel of fundamental biological importance.

Provided that the detector response is independent of the position within the detector (except perhaps for binning associated with pixels which are some submultiple of the mask pixel size), then the same mask patterns continue to offer optimal properties.

A map φ between left A-modules V and W is simply a linear transformation that commutes with the action of A, i.e., φ(av) = aφ(v). If we think of V and W as quiver representations then this condition is just the obvious constraint that the maps from Vi to Wi must commute with the linear transformations induced by the arrows, i.e., φ is a map of representations. Thus we sometimes refer to the category of left A-modules as the category of quiver representations, and we use these terms interchangeably from now on.

One effective method for finding similar articles is: 1) take the reader-keyword matrix and reduce its dimensionality (to about 50) using SVD; 2) transform all the papers into the reduced dimensionality system by fitting their keyword vectors to the significant SVD vectors; 3) cluster the (50 dimensional) article keyword vectors into many clusters (of about 1000 articles each) using hierarchal clustering techniques; 4) for each of the small clusters of papers perform a new SVD decomposition on the ≈50 dimensional vectors, reducing the dimensionality further (to about 5); 5) for each small cluster of papers transform each paper into the corresponding 5 dimensional subspace. These steps can be done in advance as part of the indexing necessary for a text retrieval system.

Now, each of the ends of the string junction may terminate on any of the N branes of the appropriate type. Thus, we see that there are of order N1 N2 N3 states present here. Furthermore, since the junction must organize itself into a representation of the (0, 4) supersymmetry, there are 4N1 N2 N3 bosonic states and their superpartners. String junctions then account for the entropy of this configuration. Note that in this frame, open string states stretching between branes are not this numerous. Thus, at least to leading order, the entropy is accounted for by non-perturbative states.

Type Ia supernovae observational data suggest that the universe is dominated by two dark components containing dark matter and dark energy (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999; de Bernardis et al. 2000; Perlmutter et al. 2003). Dark matter (DM), a matter without pressure, is mainly used to explain galactic curves and large-scale structure formation, while dark energy (DE), an exotic energy with negative pressure, is used to explain the present cosmic accelerating expansion. However, the nature of DE is still unknown, and people have proposed some candidates to describe it (for a good review see Karami et al. 2009a).

Given a specific SUSY model it is in principle possible to make a full computation of all the FCNC phenomena in that context. However, given the variety of options for low-energy SUSY (even confining ourselves here to models with R matter parity), it is important to have a way to extract from the whole host of FCNC processes a set of upper limits on quantities which can be readily computed in any chosen SUSY frame.
Remark: Knowledge on the Tanner graph of a code C can be used in the selection of algorithms. For example, if it is known that the Tanner graph of C does not contain a certain subgraph Y, then all graphs containing Y must be removed from a trapping set profile.
The spinorial nature of the respective 4D root systems thus demystifies the peculiar symmetries of the 4D Platonic solid analogues 16-cell, 24-cell (and dual) and 600-cell and their duals as essentially the rotational symmetries of the conventional 3D Platonic solids.

The χ2 is flat as a function of mt unless Rb and/or the directly measured in Fermilab mass of the top quark are included into the fit.

Update September, 2008 Litherland has computed the values for most unknown cases of 12 crossing knots. The remaining cases are: 12n41,119,120,121,145,153,199,200,243,260,282,310,322,351,362,368,377,403,414,425,475,523,549.
Observationally, the key measurements are of the expansion history (through its integral, the cosmic distance scale), and growth rate of structure (which is controlled by the expansion history and the equation of state). Large surveys across the electromagnetic spectrum can be used as precision cosmological parameter probes. Great surveys can illuminate dark corners of cosmic time such as during the neutral era (from recombination to reionization), the radiation dominated era, the inflationary epoch, and possibly back towards the Planck time.

Time-varying regularizers can also be used to perform other types of adaptation to the sequence of observed data. We give a concrete example by introducing new adaptive regularizers corresponding to weighted variants of the standard p-norm regularizer. The resulting updates, and their associated regret bounds, enjoy the property of being invariant with respect to arbitrary rescalings of individual features. Moreover, if the best linear predictor for the loss sequence is sparse, then our analysis delivers a better bound than that of OMD with 1-norm regularization, which is the standard regularizer for the sparse target assumption.

Introduction
It is at the classical T Tauri phase that aperture synthesis imaging of disks has been most productive. Kinematic analysis of OVRO observations of GM Auri gae in CO(2→1) emission provided the first evidence of solely centrifugal support in a solar nebula analog (Koerner, Sargent, & Beckwith 1993). Imaging at higher resolution and with improved signal to noise with the IRAM interferometer confirmed this interpretation (Dutrey et al. 1998). A rapidly growing list of targets have yielded similar results, including the intermediate-mass star MWC 48O. CO line emission at distinct velocities is plotted in Fig. 7 together with models of how the emission should appear if the gas is in Keplerian rotation around the star. The correspondence provides definitive proof that the gas is confined to a rotating circumstellar disk (Mannings, Koerner, & Sargent 1997). Other examples for which adequate observations have produced similar results include GG Tau (Dutrey, Guilloteau, & Simon 1994), DM Tau (Guilloteau & Dutrey 1998), and LkCa 15 (Koerner & Sargent 2001).

With cloud becoming the overarching approach for centralized information storage, retrieval and management, and mobile devices becoming the major destination of information, the successful integration of cloud computing and mobile applications therefore represents an important task. However, due to the far distance between the cloud and mobile devices, the enjoyable high-rate data exchange between cloud and mobile user is still hurdled by fundamental engineering challenges. This makes high-quality cloud-based mobile service applications still a far end to achieve, and motivates the emergence of Fog computing as an effective solution towards the smooth convergence of cloud and mobile applications.

NASCALINES: A MYSTERY WRAPPED IN AN ENIGMA
It can be concluded that the different approaches show consistent and complementary results about the size distribution of nanoparticles with radial inner structure, especially for the external radius of the particle and its average electron density. A precise value for the polydispersity degree could not be obtained as explained previously, although a credible upper limit to the polydispersity degree of 24% could be given.
Test of the GRB environment
The Warm Absorber is identified with an outflowing wind surrounding the black hole and the X-ray source. It is detected by X-ray absorption features in about 50% of Seyfert nuclei, and by broad UV absorption lines in about 15% of radio-quiet quasars. This small fraction is probably simply an effect of covering factor, the wind being a common feature in radio-quiet objects. The outflowing mass rate is not well determined, but it is certainly a non-negligible fraction of the accretion rate, and it increases with the Eddington ratio. The wind is most naturally interpreted as outflowing from the disc, but there is no consensus on the acceleration mechanism: radiative acceleration by the UV-X source, centrifugal driving from a disc threated by an open magnetic field, thermal or hydrodynamical driving from the hot corona.
In this case there is no obvious way to compress the sequence. While there is no algorithm able to test the compressibility, we can use another condition related to compressibility. From the examples above it is clear that we need equal number of zeroes and ones; but suppose you split the sequences every two symbols:
PDM is well suited to identify signals with any profile, not just a sinusoidal one. For instance, if we have a burst-like periodic signal, it is more successfully detected by the PDM algorithm than by CLEAN. On the other hand, if we knew that we are trying to estimate the period of a sinusoidal signal, it would be better to use CLEAN.

The paper is organised as follows. In Sect. II we introduce the fundamental equations and the underlying physical framework of the gravitational lensing, mainly focusing on the SFL regime. In Sect. III, we briefly revisit the MGD as well as the CFM solutions, in order to fix the notation and to define the main setup that shall be further analysed. Sect. IV is devoted to the observable quantities in the SFL regime, containing our results and their analysis, for the solutions discussed in the Sect. III. To conclude, in Sect. V we summarise the results, point out our concluding remarks and perspectives, and discuss the possibility of detection/observation of signatures of the MGD and CFM solutions.

Introduction
The toy models we consier next are abstract enough that they could apply to each of these cases and to others. To be concrete, it may be helpful to think of them as models in Galilean space-time, and so we will assume this for now. We make some comments later about possible choices of distance function that give potentially physically interesting versions of the path probability postulate in Minkowski and other Lorentzian space-times.

In the quest of understanding physics at energy scales beyond that of the standard model (SM), many ideas have been discussed rather extensively in the literature. Two of the most popular, and in some sense intertwined, theories are those of grand unification and supersymmetry. In both theories, there arise new particles that connect the quark and lepton sectors. Such a particle can either be a scalar or a vector. In this letter, we shall restrict ourselves to scalars. As for weak SU(2) properties, it can transform either as a singlet, a doublet or a triplet.
On the other hand, Nova V382 Vel 1999 had a smooth decline in the optical, and X-ray observations did not reveal any short-term periodicity. So it is unlikely that it is an IP.
The dynamics of a motile cell with unidirectional and bidirectional branching is studied with treadmilling actin polymerization kinetics. The filaments growing on both sides with treadmilling rates and branching in both directions leads to a persistent random walk whose persistency becomes infinite and leads to unidirectional drift in the case of one side branching. The dynamics are governed by diffusion at short times followed by drift at longer times.

Delplancke et al. (2001) discussed the possibilities to resolve the images of microlensed objects towards the Galactic Bulge by the use of long baseline interferometry, in particular the ESO-VLTI (K-band observations with the AMBER and PRIMA instruments). The ability to measure the angular separation between the microlensed images (of the order of 1 milli-arcsec) and to measure the brightness of the images as a function of time will enable a direct and unambiguous determination of the lens masses and locations, as well as their proper motions. This then allows one to break the degeneracy (mass, tangential velocity, distance of the lens) inherent in the interpretation of the width of the light curve of a microlensing event.

In this paper, we present a document compression system that uses hierarchical models of discourse and syntax in order to simultaneously manage all these conflicting goals. Our compression system first automatically derives the syntactic structure of each sentence and the overall discourse structure of the text given as input. The system then uses a statistical hierarchical model of text production in order to drop non-important syntactic and discourse units so as to generate coherent, grammatical document compressions of arbitrary length. The system outperforms both a baseline and a sentence-based compression system that operates by simplifying sequentially all sentences in a text.

The period-luminosity (P-L) relations of long period variables on the AGB are well documented for the Large Magellanic Cloud. Observations have revealed not only that Mira variables follow a tight near-infrared P-L relation (Glass & Lloyd Evans 1981, 2003; Feast et al. 1989), but also that semiregular variables pulsating in overtone modes follow distinct and well-defined P-L relations (Wood et al. 1999, Wood 2000). In recent years, there has been strong interest in pulsating red giants, which is reflected in the increasing number of independent analyses of large photometric databases (Cioni et al. 2001, 2003, Noda et al. 2002, Lebzelter et al. 2002, Glass & Schultheis 2003, Kiss & Bedding 2003, Ita et al. 2003, Groenewegen 2004).

We present the energy per nucleon as a function of the density at various temperatures in Fig. 3. As the temperature increases the nuclear matter becomes less bound and the the saturation curve around the equilibrium point in the ZM models is flatter than that in the Walecka model. This indicates that the nuclear matter EOS in ZM models is softer compared to the obtained in the Walecka Model, even at finite temperature. We can also conclude that the incompressibility of nuclear matter decreases when the temperature increases. This can be seen more clearly in Fig. 4 where we show the pressure-density isotherms of nuclear matter at different temperatures. Since the incompressibility K is related to ∂p/∂ρ (calculated at the equilibrium point where the pressure vanishes), we see directly that when the temperature increases K decreases, and among the ZM models, the ZM3 model always gives the softest EOS for a fixed temperature.

Preliminaries
The BLAST alignment of the PDB3 and PDB5 assemblies totals 721 Mb and we take that as our estimate of genome coverage of the SBT genome. This estimate is very conservative but we see no point in including small contigs that are not strongly placed or which might represent repeat sequences that are located in multiple regions of the tuna genome. The accurate localization of such repeats, whether they are telomeres, centromeres, short interspersed nuclear elements, or other low complexity regions, requires special techniques beyond the scope of this study. To include them in the count of the percent of the genome covered would give a false impression. Much further research is needed to complete the genome assembly of a tuna species and to make it as useful as possible. The following still needs to be done: 1) a survey of the DNA variants and their frequency distribution; 2) a cataloging of the coding sequences and the many decisions on homology that need to be made; 3) the identification of the full transcriptome of tuna; 4) the assignment of scaffolds to chromosomes; 5) the identification of promotor, enhancer, and other elements relevant to gene expression; 6) and the identification of the genome sections association with sex determination. While those are a wish-list for the future, the draft assembly presented here is a step forwards towards that goal.

By construction it is centered at a point ai, k associated to a tile Ci. Let us assume that the radius ri, j is a priori bounded by the distance between fk (5/4.Ci ) and the complement of fk (3/2.Ci ). Since ai, k ∈ 5/4.Ci , the ball Bi, k is contained in 3/2.Ci and can only intersect the cubes 3/2.C such that C and Ci are adjacent tiles. If Bi, k intersects Bj, k , the point aj, k + 1 is thus associated to a tile adjacent to Ci.

Hadron physics is found in three areas of accelerator physics at Fermilab: the Tevatron collider experiments, the neutrino program, and fixed target physics with beams from the Main Injector. At the collider, CDF and DZero are in the midst of a multi-year run now, and BTeV is scheduled to take over as soon as these programs are ended. In the neutrino program, we have MiniBooNE using beam from the Booster accelerator now, and will be turning on NuMI, the neutrino program using beam from the Main Injector, in a few weeks. The MINOS experiment will operate with the neutrino beams as soon as they are available, and the MINERvA experiment has been approved to join as soon as it can be built. Finally, there is the MIPP experiment, E907 - Main Injector Particle Production, finishing its commissioning run now, and about to get its physics data. Also approved for the 120 GeV Main Injector program is a Drell-Yan experiment (E906), which is starting to build its detector this year. The possibility of returning to run for kaon physics using beam from the Main Injector is retained.
The most general context in which PAC learning makes sense is far too broad to say anything meaningful about the full problem of determining whether a class is learnable. If we were to allow the instance space to be an arbitrary set, and a concept class an arbitrary subset of the power set of the instance space, we would quickly be thinking about a non-trivial fragment of set theory.

We performed a comparative analysis of the two models with the standard VMM, which, to our knowledge is state of the art in melody generation. We showed that in a long-term prediction task both models perform significantly better than the VMM and comparably with each other. The Dirichlet-VMM is a better next-step predictor, which can be partially accredited to its main strength, that is its ability to use shorter or longer contexts depending on whether they provide useful information or not.

The attack strategy would then be to request encryptions of known or chosen plaintexts. The One-Time pad bit strings are available for analysis after removing (XOR-ing) the known plaintexts from the ciphertext. If some statistical deviation from a pure, uncorrelated, uniform distribution can be detected in the bit strings, the challenges can in principle be won. Simply chose the ciphertext that XORed with the plaintext shows the anomaly.
As described above, the EoR imaging process weights and adds a number of two minute snapshots. As each snapshot is short, the aperture plane is incompletely sampled such that all detected sources generate sidelobes. Each snapshot is imaged separately with the sources being deconvolved to a limit of about 4 times the typical rms of each snapshot. Whilst sidelobe confusion reduces as sources are extracted, there is a limit; eventually the sidelobe terms exceed those from real sources and any further CLEAN iterations will diverge rather than improve the imaging process. As a result, sidelobes from the fainter sources plus those from sources outside the imaged FoV remain in the snapshot images. The mosaicking process (weighted average of N snapshots) reduces the thermal noise and improves the synthesised beam. However, as neither the fainter sources nor the far-field sources have been deconvolved in the individual snapshots, their sidelobes remain in the mosaic.
We get
It follows then

If the wall were rough however, it would be represented by a potential U(x, y, z) where x and y are coordinate axes parallel to the mean plane of the wall. Any eigenfunction of the motionless ground state of the system would be a function of all the coordinates of all the particles. Therefore the boosted Galilean state cannot be an eigenstate of the system for any non-zero value of the velocity.

Let N be a pseudoconvex compact CR manifold, endowed with a transverse flow X which is a conformal flow in respect to the Levi metric, then the closure of the orbits of X are torus.
We can summarize the above discussion in the following
Pruning the cycle trees
A resolving set S of G is minimal if no proper subset of S is a resolving set. An upper basis is a minimal resolving set containing the maximum number of vertices. The upper dimension dim + (G) is the size of an upper basis. The resolving number res(G) is the minimum k such that every k-subset of V(G) is a resolving set of G.
The natural way to proceed is to create synthetic voxelizations, where we take a CT scan and reduce the resolution in y. This emulates the result of perfect noise-free voxelization at various resolutions. We can present patients whose diagnosis is clear on CT, and determine at what voxelization resolution the diagnosis becomes obvious. This would effectively give us a lower bound on the resolution that we need to achieve.

Assuming only single scattering process and free electron wave propagation between scatterers, the transmission probability of an electron with momentum k in a wire with on-site disorder can be written as:
Our method ETM incorporates the word correlation knowledge provided by words embedding over the latent topic to cluster short texts to generate long pseudo-text. In this condition, the frequency of words in pseudo-text plays an important role to discover the topics based on this assumption each text is modeled as a mixture of topics. Simultaneously, our model ETM uses the word correlation knowledge over the latent topic to encourage correlated words to share the same topic label. Hence, although similar words may not have high co-occurrence in the corpus, they remain have a high probability to be put into the same topic. Consequently, from Table 1 we can see that the topics learned by our model are far better than those learned by the baselines. The learned topics have high coherence and contain fewer noisy and irrelevant words. Our model also can recognize the topic words that only have a few occurrences in the collection. For instance, the word flight from Topic 2, writer from topic 3, and tablet can only be recognized by our model ETM.
The equations of motion of this theory take a very simple form
We have presented a novel formulation of centrality for dynamic networks that measures the number of paths that exist over time in a network. Given snapshots of the network at different times showing the connected nodes, we can calculate dynamic centrality and use this metric to rank nodes by how well connected they are over time to the rest of the network. In addition, we can identify nodes that are best connected to, and therefore, exert most influence on, a given node. We can also vary the time and length scale parameters to identify nodes that are globally or locally connected.
In this section, we characterize a skyline query in terms of previous skyline queries, which help relate the new query to those in the cache.
We have investigated the invariants for non-generic three-qubit states, and presented a complete set of invariants for a class of nongeneric three-qubit quantum mixed states. Any two of these density matrices are locally equivalent if and only if all these invariants have equal values for these density matrices. For more complicated cases, e.g. there are more zero entries in the components of α, β, γ in the canonical point of an orbit, by adding some new invariants we can also determine the parameters R, S, T, Q up to a sign. However we only know how to determine the sign by adding more new invariants for some special cases. The problem for general cases is still open.
Although photometric-redshift results can predict redshifts, in a static model this is not evidence for time dilation. The use of spectroscopic aging can predict light curve widths. But in a static model this is not a prediction of redshift. Consequently both results are consistent with the static model.
We assume a non-detuning case, namely, the total Hamiltonian is expressed as
The important feature is that the resulting interaction has a Gaussian form:
After excluding all double and invalid submissions, we consider the data of 217 participants, which overall includes information about 7,114 communication partners that performed 22,365 calls and wrote and received 84,325 messages. For 3,449 contacts (48,4%) we received personal ratings of trust and closeness. The size of the contact list ranges per participant from 2 up to 1,827 entries with a mean value of 249.3. The standard deviation of 308.7 indicates high fluctuation. However, the address book may include outdated entries. On average 32 different communication partners appear in the call and message logs that show active parties, and an average of 304.6 calls and 739.2 messages have been handled.

Now note that
Starting with luminosity relations of standard candles, the steps was described that one should follow to estimate the constraints of a luminosity relation on cosmological parameters using mock data, from which a simple and general formula was deduced that can be used to directly calculate the marginal likelihood of cosmological parameters. Using the formula together with the dependence of the cosmic expansion on the dark energy EOS, it was shown how a kind of bias could arise that leads to a fake evolution of the dark energy EOS, whose significance depends on the flexibility of the parameterization of the dark energy EOS and the redshift distribution of the data. Then the formula was generalized to more than just standard candles. It was shown that the BAO data could lead to similar biases. It was mentioned that the issue represents a class of mathematical problems of Bayesian analysis and should be paid attention to in similar analyses.
We now show that symplectic 4-manifolds with b + 2 = 1 necessarily have b2 ≤ 10, as stated in the introduction (note that we always assume symplectic forms to be compatible with the orientation, i.e. of positive square).

Hence, the effect of the bubbles on the LM properties is out of the scope of the presented work and may deserve a dedicated publications taking into account multiphase flow.

Abstract
The result of comparison is in Table 3, 4 and 5. It is interesting to note that the advantages of our design over the earlier proposals (observed for NCT circuits) and all other conclusions remained same.
We start with the following theorem.
In this paper, we propose a novel dependency-parsing-model-based automatic MT evaluation metric DPMF. DPMF evaluates the syntactic similarity through the score of hypothesis dependency parsing model and evaluates the lexical similarity by unigram F-score. The syntactic similarity method is designed from the view of dependency tree generation, which is totally different from the method of comparing the sub-structures and avoids the defects of defining sub-structures by human. The experiment results show the effectiveness of DPMF on both system level evaluation and sentence level evaluation. DPMF gets the- state-of-art performance on system level on WMT 2012, WMT 2013 and WMT 2014. On sentence level, the performance of DPMF is comparable with METEOR on all of the three data sets.
In each point-to-point interaction, the agent has to formally promise to use (-) the delivery service promised by the agent giving (+). This is the algebra of binding. There is no notion of a permanent virtual circuit, as say in ATM. However, if we add handshaking, a similar story can be told about ATM, Frame Relay, MPLS and other systems.
The main results are as follows:
which leads to relations between the elements in the two matrices.
Since (ε21/10)n6 > 2δn6 at least half of them have a 4-tuple from M. Each such 4-tuple is counted at most 3n2 times, so we obtain the contradiction (ε21/20)n6/(3n2) ≤ | M | =oδ(n4). We may therefore assume that
The strong compression of the isophots in the direction of the main component and the presence of a tail in the opposite side suggests that these two components are in interaction. It also indicates that the subcluster gas is stripped by ram pressure as it encounters the main cluster atmosphere. Furthermore, simulations made by Roettiger et al. (1997) have shown that gas stripping is more efficient in case of mergers with large differences in mass of the components which seems to be the case here.

It is interesting that the hot components of the best studied SyRNe, RS Oph and T CrB, show intrinsic activity (high and low states) between their TNR nova outbursts, with timescales, and other features (e.g. a blue continuum with A/F-type absorption lines) similar to those characterizing the multiple outburst activity of Z And-type stars, and very likely due to some accretion disk instability (Gromadzki et al. 2008).
By choosing L = L0 and using Lemma 7, we see that the assumption from the beginning of this section leads to a contradiction. This proves Theorem 3.

The main purpose of this note is to demonstrate the fact that it is possible to obtain the black hole metrics without solving the field equations simply by appealing to a general guiding principle which points to the covering properties of Einstein gravity over Newtonian gravity. The symmetry part of the metric is dictated by the equipotential surfaces which are spheres and ellipsoids for static and rotating black holes respectively. The rest is quite uniquely fixed by incorporation of velocity of light being constant and of Newtonian gravity in the first approximation. This is a very novel and simple way of obtaining the black hole metrics.
We also need to specify the background observation period based on the expected rate of change of the background spectrum. If the background is known to vary naturally over a period of a few days or weeks, we may use only the most recent few days to form the background to avoid using an outdated background estimate.

So far, the few proper motion measurements available for LG dwarf galaxies seem to indicate that the latter have low eccentricity orbits (e.g. the Magellanic Clouds in Kroupa & Bastian 1997 and Sculptor in Schweitzer et al. 1995). If this result will be confirmed by the forthcoming generation of high-precision astrometric missions, like GAIA and SIM, the outer flattening observed in the stellar profiles of dSphs will be hardly explained within CDM models. Recently, Eke et al. (2000) have shown that in warm dark matter models small galaxy halos have NFW profiles with c < 5; these cosmologies would easily match the observations and, in addition, could yield the correct number of satellites in galaxy halos (Moore et al. 1999) as well as halo profiles soft enough to reproduce the rotation curves of LSB galaxies (de Blok et al. 2000).

Again the basis of the free Abelian group T is considered part of the data of the fusion module, and again we will call those basis elements simple vectors. In a similar way, we can define right fusion modules and fusion bimodules. There are obvious notions of isomorphisms of fusion rings, fusion modules, and fusion bimodules (namely there should be bijections on the basis sets which preserve the algebraic structure).
An alternative method to etching is electrolytic polishing or electropolishing (EP) in which the material is removed in an acid mixture under the flow of an electric current. Sharp edges and burrs are smoothed out and a very glossy surface can be obtained. The electric field is high at protrusions so these will be dissolved first. On the other hand, the field is low in the grain boundaries and little material will be removed here while in the BCP process strong etching is observed in the boundaries between grains.

7) The proposed new particle with mass in the knee energy range (at 3 PeV) may not be stable, as in the case of the standard model. If it is a member of a supersymmetric multiplet and weakly interacting with ordinary particles, then the stable particle of lowest mass becomes a candidate for a DMP. The only requirement is that such particles must be present in AGN or black holes so that the phenomenon of the knee energy is observed when cosmic rays are emitted from AGN.

In terms of structure learning, we have derived an LDAG-based Bayesian score and an MCMC-based search method that combines stochastic global changes with deterministic local changes. Our experimental results agree with previous research in the sense that incorporation of CSI in the learning phase improves model quality. However, we also noted that an appropriate prior must be used for optimal performance.
(The observed dark energy may not be a true cosmological constant. It could be a time-varying quantity such as quintessence. For the purposes of this remark it does not make any difference.)
Modern reconfigurable networks have a complexity unprecedented in the history of engineering: we are approaching scales of billions of components. Such systems are less akin to a traditional engineering enterprise such as a bridge, and more akin to a living organism in terms of complexity. A bridge must be designed so that key components never fail, since there is no way for the bridge to automatically recover from system failure. In contrast, a living organism cannot be designed so that no component ever fails: there are simply too many components. For example, skin can be cut and still heal. Designing skin that can heal is much more practical than designing skin that is completely impervious to attack. Unfortunately, current algorithms ensure robustness in computer networks through hardening individual components or, at best, adding lots of redundant components. Such an approach is increasingly unscalable.
Graph states in the stabilizer formalism
Many interesting mathematical problems can be reformulated as global optimisation problems; the solution of systems of algebraic or even differential equations, for example, can be cast quite naturally in terms of optimisation. The same holds true for the all-important inverse problems that are ubiquitous in the physical sciences, i.e. problems where one seeks to transform experimental data into model parameters in order infer properties of the physical systems being studied (a simple example: choosing parameters to minimise a χ2-statistic when fitting a Voigt-profile to a spectral line).

To show that the time constants were identifiable in the fully general case, we used a linear system that emerges from the structure of the HH equations and their derivatives. By solving the linear system and equating one entry in the resulting vector with the products of others, we generated an input-output equation. The coefficients of this input-output equation were the coefficients of the polynomial with roots at the time constants and sums of time constants. We were further able to demonstrate the identifiability of the time constants by using the method described in our proof to compute two time constants from simulated data.

More importantly, the scale of the linear point shifts even less than either the peak or the dip. The net result is that the peak moves by 3.5% to the left, the dip by 1.5% to the right and the linear point by just 1% to the left. (These shifts are smaller at higher redshifts, of course.) The peak is consequently the most sensitive point to nonlinear corrections and the linear point is the least. Moreover, because the dip and the peak share the same nonlinear smoothing, the amplitude of the linear point remains unchanged to within a few percent even though the dip and the peak (heights and scales) change significantly.

To account for presence of sporadic denser aerosol layers at various heights or at ground level as Garstang (1991b) is beyond the scope of this work. We will also neglect the presence of mountains which might shield the light emitted from the sources to a fraction of the atmospheric particles along the line-of-sight of the observer. Given the vertical extent of the atmosphere in respect to the highness of the mountains, the shielding is not negligible only when the source is very near the mountain and both are quite far from the site (Garstang 1989, see also Cinzano 1999a). We also neglected the effects of the Ozone layer and the presence of volcanic dust studied by Garstang (1991b, 1991c).

Introduction
In this paper, using the first principle non-collinear RS-LMTO-ASA method, we have presented theoretical predictions of the magnetic configurations of several Mn corrals placed on the Pt(111) surface. We have found that neighboring Mn atoms present strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, leading to collinear magnetic configurations when the geometrical frustration is avoided, and novel non-collinear ordering for corrals on a frustrated lattice. In particular, the Mn corral composed by six corner sharing triangles shows a new perception of magnetic structures in nanomagnets, presenting very complex stable magnetic configurations, which can be described by topological structures, as Z2 vortices. We expect that the present work can motivate further studies on topological nanomaterials for novel spin devices.

This paper has reviewed some of the interesting results of flux emergence simulations based on the resistive MHD equations. Despite the lack of radiative transfer effects and the complex details of a fully convective solar interior, many significant phenomena and much physical insight can be gained. The aim of these more idealized models is to correctly follow the magnetic field evolution, as it rises from the solar interior and emerges into the solar corona.

Consider first that state 2 (the weak photon) is at a higher energy than the ground state 0, and state 1 is at a lower energy than ground. If both lasers are turned on together, the sum will combine eqs. 6 and 11.
A prominent concept implied by the current definition is that the effective influence of one part of a system depends on the state of the whole system, meaning that in general Topological Causality is related but not identical to coupling. The latter entails the possibility of temporal variations of the mutual effective influences, which indeed can be captured by the proposed method.

Since the evolution of our field is continuous, connectivity within the coronal magnetic field is maintained throughout the simulation. The resultant series of non-potential equilibria retain a memory of flux interactions from one step to the next, and subsequently the build up of non-potential effects. This is a significantly different approach compared to independent potential field extrapolations, and provides a new insight into the energy budget of the quiet Sun corona.

In Section 2, we recall the definition of the odds ratio and express the B-spline calibration estimator. In Section 3, we use linearization to derive the asymptotic variance of the estimator under broad assumptions. We infer a variance estimator together with asymptotic normal confidence intervals. In Section 4, we draw guidelines for practical implementation and show the properties of our estimator on two case studies.

In a pioneering exposition of mathematical astronomy for the public, Sir John Herschel attributed the stability of the ring of Saturn to its being eccentric with respect to the planet and lopsided (asymmetric in mass) by a minute amount. Tracing the sources and effects of this error reveals several lessons of general relevance to science: on the formulation and interpretation of calculations, the use of cutting-edge observations and the combining of observations with theory. I emphasise the phenomenon of reinforcing errors.
Now we deal with the cases k = 3 and k = 4.

Physical intuition has not led us astray, after all. In spite of its fallibility, physical intuition is invaluable in the investigation of physical phenomena. The situation here discussed reveals, however, that the appeal to intuitive arguments requires caution. In particular, it is not possible or, at least, it is dangerous to dissociate the physical intuition from the mathematical description of the phenomena.

We tried to estimate the spectral index variation crude. For this purpose we use both the COBE data and 19.2 GHz survey (Boughn et al., 1992). We has converted latter data to a COBE beam shape (Wright et al., 1994a). After that we analyzed the frequency dependence of the most intensive spherical harmonics and determined the accuracy of the estimation.
Behavior
For such studies to be successful they require objects that have been very well characterized observationally (η Car, SN 1987A; Collins et al 1998). The Egg Nebula is becoming one such object. Figure 1 presents the results of a paleontological study of the Egg nebula (Delamarter et al. 1999) in which simulations that included H2 chemistry and excitation as well as post-processed scattered light image production were carried out. After more than 50 simulations we found that the GISW model could not recover the observed features of the Egg. Further simulations showed that the best fit to H2 and scattered light intensity maps required a torus ejected at about the same time as a fully collimated jet. The torus and jet were distinct, non-interacting dynamical features. Based on the requirement that H2 not become dissociated the results allowed for reasonably unique determination of the mass loss history of the central star. We note in Fig 1, however, that these models could not recover the unusual tuning-fork pattern seen in the scattered light images of the Egg. The images did produce a good match to other PPN such as IRAS 17150-3224.

Abstract
The situation for composite particles such as protons and neutrons is more involved. We assume that their masses are made of a flavor-dependent contribution proportional to the masses of the three valence quarks determined by the Higgs coupling, and a color-symmetrical term only dependent on the quark-quark and quark-gluon interaction, i.e. proportional to the QCD constant ΛQCD ≃ 300 MeV. The latter term dominates for lighter, relativistic quarks constituting the valence component of protons and neutrons. Then, due to the universality of the QCD coupling constant for different flavors and for all gluons exchange, we can parametrize the proton and neutron masses in terms of flavor-dependent and flavor-independent parts as:

If one calculates the Rrms for the system of interest using the nodeless eigenstate of PEP, the value of 6.78 fm is obtained. Even the wave functions differ in the node number, like the deuteron case discussed in Section 3, the Rrms is nearly the same for the phase-equivalent potentials, which is found about 6.70 fm for the initial deep potential, whereas 6.17 fm for the intermediate non-phase-equivalent potential. One should not forget that the non-PEP potential does not belong to the PEP family, that is why the corresponding Rrms values so close for the PEP potentials while that of non-PEP considerably differ than the others. Moreover, the corresponding eigenfunction of this non-PEP potential has a different asymptotic behavior as well.

The divergency of field and current density can lead to overheating and melting of narrow necks. If we assume that breakdown is determined by the critical density of heat emission Qc, all places where σF2 > Qc will be overheated. It means that some number of overheated places occurs in any weak field F0 independently on the field strength. So the application of field irreversibly change the electrical properties of system. Moreover, the direction of field tends to the residual anisotropy of a system.
The main limitation of SODA is that the stepwise detectable condition might not hold when marginal effects are very weak. However, in empirical studies we found the SODA works well and has better performance compared to other methods, which suggests this problem may not be severe in real data. Indeed, even for QDA it takes some efforts to construct mean vectors and covariance matrices that result in only interaction but no main effect.

Singlet ground states were calculated taking into account the 1760 (1754) electrons of the defect-free (single defect) nanoribbons. Normal modes and the infrared spectra were obtained afterwards and checked for negative frequencies. Finally, the oscillator strengths to estimate the UV-VIS spectra were found using the C.I. (Configuration Interaction) wavefunction approach taking into account the complete active space with contributions from 24 molecular orbitals (HOMO-11 up to LUMO+11). In the end, the C.I. ground state plus the first 127 excited states were acquired and analyzed. The final structures, after the semiempirical geometry optimization of the closed nanoribbons, are presented in Fig. 2.
Conclusions
A weakness of QIR as described here is the cost of evaluating f exactly at various rational points. For instance, if f is a high degree polynomial and the evaluation point x is a rational with large denominator then f(x) is likely to have an enormous denominator: more or less the n-th power of the denominator of x where n is the degree of f.
Alternatively, one can show both statements by checking the list of 24 related hypergeometric equations:

The measurements described above define the behavior P which Eve has to reproduce (possibly using other quantum realizations of arbitrary dimension). Clearly, the four-output measurement R, when acting on half of a maximally entangled state, gives P(b | y = 7) = 1/4 for all b and thus G(y = 7, P) ≥ 1/4. As mentioned previously, this is only a trivial upper bound on the amount of intrinsic randomness, which is generally far from being tight. However, we now prove that for the correlations P defined above the bound is tight and, therefore, G(y = 7, P) = 1/4 and hence two-bits of local randomness can be certified from P.

No difference in micromotion heating rate is expected among the different designs, since total micromotion amplitudes are comparable. Indeed, in all cases axial micromotion amplitudes are much smaller than total amplitudes, indicating that rf-fringing should not limit crystal growth for these designs. The actual limit on crystal size due to micromotion heating is difficult to estimate, but it can in principle be found from molecular dynamics simulations.

The case discussed above provides a link between plane and axisymmetric pp-waves. Even for it, eq(37) is the normal form of the general linear second-order equation and its general solution is given analytically only if a non-trivial concrete solution is known. Therefore we are going to discuss two cases of simple u-dependence when the solution of (6) may be found. These are the impulsive and shock waves.

In this paper we have shown how the intuitions underlying the axiom of recovery can be rescued by paying attention to the assumptions underlying putative counterexamples. We argued that the axiom of recovery places an important rationality constraint on iterated revision, a framework that requires that we think of revision as taking place on epistemic states which encode preferences rather than just flat belief sets. We believe the connection between the axiom of recovery and the (C2) postulate of Darwiche-Pearl to be an interesting one. For future work it might be interesting to try and obtain a weakened version of the (C1) postulate in a way that is similar to what we have done in this paper.

Software diversification is a probabilistic technique that uses code and data randomization and expressiveness in the target instruction set to generate large amounts of functionally equivalent but different binaries. Malware diversity builds on software diversity and ensures that any two diversified instances of the same malware have low similarity (according to a set of similarity metrics). An LLVM-based prototype implementation diversifies both code and data of binaries and our evaluation shows that signatures based on similarity only match one or few instances in a pool of diversified binaries generated from the same source code.
Unfortunately the available data give no way to estimate the variation with required precision. For more reliable conclusions it is necessary to have the sensitivity many times better than COBE instrument has.
Many massive objects (single or binary) are born in dense (embedded) clusters, containing a few 10s up to a few 1000s massive stars and even more (e.g., the clusters in the Carina association, the Arches and Quintuplet clusters in the galactic bulge, the Orion nebula cluster, R136 in the LMC, MGG-11 in M82, etc.). In these clusters the evolution of each object may be affected by the presence of all the others, or at least by the closest neighbors. In sections 3 and 4 we discuss a few peculiar massive objects that may be the result of the dynamical evolution of stars in dense clusters, we like to call them Unconventionally Formed Objects (UFOs).

The NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998) contains 1.8 million radio sources with flux density at 1400 MHz greater than 2.5 mJy with linear polarization information. Many pulsars are known to have high linear polarization on average. Han & Tain (1999) identified 97 known pulsars from the NVSS source catalogue and they found that, on average, the linear polarization percentage of pulsars is much higher than that of other classes of objects such as quasars and BL-Lac objects. Therefore, high linear polarization can be used as a criterion for selecting pulsars with all kinds of possible periods, including submillisecond pulsars for which normal untargetted surveys are presently impossible. Submillisecond pulsars could be strange-quark stars, which have been explored theoretically (e.g. Madsen 1998), but with no detection observationally yet (e.g. Edwards et al. 2001).

Using self-consistent evolutionary models of disk galaxy formation within ΛCDM halos, and under the assumption of detailed angular momentum conservation and λ = const in time, we find that the disk stellar and gas surface density profiles are in good agreement with observations. The core excess w.r.t. the exponential law that the models show corresponds to a bulge formed by disk gravitational instabilities (AF00). In the case of bulge-less LSB disks, although there are models presenting negligible core excess, most of them tend to show slightly more concentrated SB profiles than those observed. The introduction of shallow cores in the halos alleviates this problem. A key point to have in mind is the very discontinuous nature of the cosmological MAHs and the SF physics.
If one does not focus on a strongly constrained system like the Earth-Moon system but just on terrestrial planets of arbitrary mass with satellites that tend to stabilize their spin axis, the parameter space is broadened. It becomes difficult to draw strict limits on the parameters because collision simulations for a wider range of impacts were not available for our study. Hence, based on published Moon-forming SPH simulations by Canup (2004, 2008), we use a semi-analytic expression to constrain the mass of a circumplanetary disk that can form a satellite. In addition, we include tidal evolution and study the ability of the satellite to stabilize the spin axis of the planet.

In many experiments on polarization entanglement between two photons generated from down conversion, it is common to take into account only those data where two (or more) photons were detected, (at least) one on each side A and B, and ignore the null results where photons were not detected on both sides. For Quinten this is a correct procedure, one reason being it relies only on the fair-sampling assumption. Another way to see that this procedure is correct, is to note it can be simulated by a local filtering operation. We may imagine on each side independently a polarization-independent lossy channel, then a quantum-non-demolition (QND) measurement of photon number, and filtering out those cases where no photons are found. Here one would use the relation
A hyper-graph extends the normal graph definition so that an edge can connect any number of vertices. A hyper-graph HG(V, E) is constructed as follows: each vertex vi represents a tuple group Mi; each hyper-edge ei = (v1, v2, ..., vn) represents a transaction Xi in W accessing all the tuple groups connected by this hyper-edge. A vertex vi has two kinds of weights size(Mi) and access(Mi). The weight count(ei) of a hyper-edge ei is the number of transactions that access the same vertices (i.e. tuple groups).

Until now, we have evaluated the deceleration schemes based on total number of molecules decelerated. For experiments that use a slow controlled molecular beam, the total number or integrated flux is the important metric, but for experiments requiring loading molecules into a trap, density also plays a role. A table of the decelerated fraction, molecular density, and number of rings used for the different protocols is shown Table II. The densities were calculated from the simulations by counting the number of molecules in the central well of the decelerator and assuming the molecules were uniformly distributed in the well volume. We note this underestimates the true peak well density. We expect that slowing protocols that make use of longer hexapoles would result in decreased well densities because longitudinal phase-space distribution spreads during the flight time in the hexapole. This idea is borne out in the case of linear slowing protocols; the peak density decreased for longer hexapole length, although the decrease is not very significant over the range explored.
Our claim then follows from the integral test.
If the emission is steady and if the direction of emission is randomly and statistically isotropically distributed on the sky, the emission must be collimated into a solid angle

Another interesting question is how many independent physical parameters control the observable properties of GCs? Following the pioneering study by Brosche & Lentes (1984), more modern data sets suggest that there are at most 6 significant parameters among 9 or 10 independently measured observables (Djorgovski 1991, Djorgovski & Meylan 1994). If one considers just the observed photometric, structural, and dynamical parameters at both core and half-light scales, the statistical dimensionality of the data is 3, or 4 if the (M/L) ratios are included. This is exactly as expected for a manifold of King (1966) models.
Figures 6 and 7 display plots of the first two PCA coefficients and Fourier amplitudes, respectively, for our data, plotted against each other. Whilst A1 and A2 are correlated with each other, PCA1 and PCA2 are not, by construction. A similar situation would occur had we plotted A1 or A2 against A3. This is another advantage of PCA analysis of variable starlight curves: the different PCA components are orthogonal to each other. A practical advantage of this feature is outlined in the next section.

In practice the situation is not yet quite so clean. The holy grail in the field is an absorption system with very simple velocity structure (a single isolated cold cloud is best, with a temperature low enough to make the D identification secure), with a flow field and temperature highly constrained by metal lines (but still with low metal abundance, so that D is not destroyed significantly), with high S/N, high resolution data including well resolved, optically thin Lyman series lines and extending well beyond the Lyman limit. No system yet combines all of these attributes, although some come close.

We assumed that the expected value of 26 Mg counts in each cycle of the Iris measurement is equal to the sum of nonradiogenic 26Mg and radiogenic 26Mg. The nonradiogenic component is equal to the counts of 24 Mg multiplied by a linear instrumental mass fractionation correction (determined by the standards as described previously) and a sample linear mass fractionation correction (a free parameter). The radiogenic component is equal to the 27 Al counts (corrected for the different count times between the Mg isotopes and 27 Al) multiplied by (26 Al/27 Al)0 (a free parameter). Additionally, the nonradiogenic component of the expected 26 Mg counts in a cycle should be proportional to the measured 25 Mg counts. We assumed that the counts in each cycle follow a Poisson distribution with mean given by the expectation value described above with either 24 Mg or 25 Mg as the natural reference isotope, and maximized the log-likelihood function of all the measured cycles with both reference isotopes simultaneously. The maximum of the log-likelihood function occurs at the most likely values of the sample linear mass bias and (26 Al/27 Al)0 as described by our collected data. We determined robust confidence intervals on these two parameters by Monte Carlo simulation with 105 trials, assuming statistical and systematic uncertainties of isotope counts, isotope ratios, and instrumental mass fractionation as determined from our standard measurements.
To date, the gas has been modelled only as a single-phase medium, i.e. only one temperature and density at any given radius. For initial conditions we assume a hydrostatic pressure profile of the isothermal form. The outer boundary pressure is adjusted so that the gas mass is some appropriate fraction (≈ 0.2) of the total mass.

In this paper we develop a set of mathematical tools that can be applied to analyze measures over random circuits. We apply these tools to demonstrate that under increasing length of the random circuit the measure over random circuits converges uniformly to the Haar measure on the group. We show that the rate of convergence (as a function of increasing gate depth) is generically exponential, though the exponent must itself decrease exponentially with the number of qubits. At the end of this paper we describe how specific applications can define weaker convergence conditions, leading to the possibility that efficient random circuits composed from a discrete set of universal gates might be able to adequately mimic the Haar measure.

which shows that for large energies the dynamics for r > r0 is projected onto a tight peak in the (θ, r) plane. Thus most of the part of the θ-coordinate is covered when the particle is under the circular orbit r = r0 although the system spends its time essentially over that circular orbit (see Fig. 5).
The high temperature (low β) limit is more interesting. Here the large values of N contribute, and the partition function has a simple pole at β = 1 indicating a phase transition. A rigorous way to study the β → 0 behavior is by analytic continuation which involves one in a study of the zeros of the zeta function in the critical strip 0 < Re(β) < 1. However, we can expose part of the physical content of the high temperature behavior in the following simpler manner: For any x and β consider the quantity:

where Σ(r) is the surface density at r, the distance from the central star; α is some exponent determining the slope; Σ0 is a density normalization parameter; and r0 = 1 AU.

Observations and data reduction
We have discussed infinitely stretched BPS string configurations in the 7-brane backgrounds in this papar. But, for further understanding of the BPS states and the 3-string junction generating process in the 7-brane backgrounds, an M-theory description of finitely stretched BPS string configurations ending on 7-branes would be desired.
Thus the decay behaviour of the entropy is much faster than that of the coordinate-coordinates coupling. This is due to the much stronger dependence of the memory friction kernel on the frequency and hence it changes the thermodynamic behaviour of the system a lot at low temperature.

Returning now to the axial vector meson spectrum, our results give mA/mV = 1.60(7) at a quark mass corresponding to mV = 1.8mP. This can be compared with the value of the ratio deduced from experimental data: 1.48(2) as discussed above. Again there is evidence for a discrepancy between the quenched lattice result and experiment. Since there has been relatively little study of this ratio in lattice work, the finite size and finite a errors are not easy to estimate. Further work is again needed.

The two hyperparameters of the algorithm are the arity of gates (k) and the depth of the circuit (d). The running time scales exponentially with both hyperparameters, but in practice very good result can be obtain with small values of both k and d. Arity of 4 and depth of 8 appears to be a good default hyperparameter setting that gave good results in all our experiments. With this configuration, the classifier is a tree with 21845 internal nodes and 65536 leaves. For those hyperparameter the C# training time (32 bits) is roughly 10.6s when the number of training example is 50,000 (Using 6 cores and 12 treads the time is reduced to 2.5s). Note that the time required to evaluate the classifier is not much smaller; more than a second is needed to performs 50000 classifications, with such a circuit. With default hyperparameters our algorithm compares favorably with neural nets and with the right choice of hyperparameters it is possible to obtain even better results.
Further, the calculation shows that there is one massive boson. Comparing this result with the Bethe ansatz solution, we get to know where the Bogoliubov approximation goes wrong as far as the condensate evaluation is concerned. That is, the Bethe ansatz solutions show that the negative energy states of the left and right mover fermions are not mixed up with each other while the energy dispersions of the two fermions in the Bogoliubov vacuum are connected to each other. This causes the finite fermion condensate in the Thirring model in the Bogoliubov transformed vacuum which is not the eigenstate of the Hamiltonian.

The optical light curve of Nova V1494 Aql 1999/2 showed slow oscillations with a quasi-period of 7 days (Kiss & Thomson 2000). A period of 3.2 h (presumably the orbital period) was discovered in its optical light curve (Retter et al. 2000b). Drake et al. (2001, in preparation) detected a 2523-s periodicity in two X-ray runs using Chandra. The short period can be interpreted as the spin period of the binary system, and the nova is very likely an IP.

The earliest simulations of binary NS coalescence in full general relativity were carried out by Nakamura, Oohara, & Kojima (1987) using Eulerian techniques. Although there are currently a number of efforts worldwide aimed at developing relativistic coalescence models (e.g. Font, et al. 2000; Landry & Teukolsky 1999; Baumgarte, et al. 1999) this subject is still in its infancy. All fully relativistic codes to date are Eulerian.

The mean value at low temperatures is given by the harmonic approximation:
The vertex-shelling convex geometry of a tree is the convex geometry consisting of the sets of vertices of the subtrees. The size of any stem of the edge-shelling convex geometry of a tree is two. Every trace of the edge-shelling convex geometry of a tree is also the edge-shelling convex geometry of some tree. On the other hand, the size of some stem of some vertex-shelling convex geometry is not two. Some trace of some vertex-shelling convex geometry is not a vertex-shelling convex geometry.

The notion of coexistence of observables is a rather general notion and it seems to be open to characterizations only under further specifications. They will be studied next.
The HXD/PIN spectrum was extracted and corrected for deadtime using the standard tools. The deadtime fraction amounted to only a few percent. We then used the non X-ray background file from Suzaku that corresponded to our observation to correct its exposure time to match the background. We then modeled the cosmic X-ray background using a response file provided from Suzaku for the XIS nominal pointing using XSPEC v.11.3. The corrected non-X-ray background file was added to the simulated cosmic X-ray background file; the combined file served as the background file for analysis of the HXD/PIN spectrum.
where x defines the position on each bond. At the vertices the wavefunctions have to satisfy boundary conditions that make the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. For instance one can consider Neumann (or Kirchhoff) boundary conditions; these require that at each vertex the wavefunctions of all adjacent bonds are equal and their outward pointing derivatives sum to zero.

There are several regression loss functions that can be used. Here, we consider the following loss function:

Note that this criterion is statistical rather than logical. We emphasize that after the observations were carried out we only accept or reject the appropriate hypothesis.
It has been statistically found that a fraction of CSS quasars has apparent sub-galactic size due to projection effects (Fanti et al. 1990), and further, the pc-scale radio morphology seems to distinguish between galaxies (compact doubles or Compact Symmetric Objects, CSOs) dominated by mini-lobe emission, and quasars, where most of the radio emission comes from unresolved cores and pc-scale jets (e.g. Stanghellini et al. 1997). There are a few exceptions to this picture, and those particularly interesting are the lobe dominated quasars. In general the radio cores of the GPS quasars are less prominent than in flat spectrum quasars (Stanghellini et al. 2001). All this is consistent with Unified Scheme predictions.
These can be solved for χ(τ) = x(τ) + iy(τ) resulting in

When there is no maximum decoding delay constraint, we assume that the receiver sends one bit to the transmitter at the beginning of each coherence interval indicating the occurrence/non-occurrence of the event:

We are finally ready to prove the key proposition.
Knowing the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic properties of the thermal plasma, we can compute its ionization state and thermal emission as explained before, now taking into account the back-reaction of accelerated particles on the SNR.
In the preceding section, I showed limits on the degrees of the iterated maps. The proof however does not show how to build transformations of the given degree. This will be remedied in this section.
Numerical Method
Thus, the Bose condensate survives at low temperatures T < T0. It can be seen that T0 and TB differ only by a factor of the order of unity.
Although in an enzymatic reaction the global free energy change is predetermined by the substrate, the products, and the nature of their reaction, the actual shape of the energy profile along the reaction coordinate depends on the enzyme structure. Our results confirm that although the efficiency is not affected by the shape of the energy profile, the reaction velocity and the strength of the stationary distribution stability can be highly improved by properly shaping this profile. This behavior is contrary to that observed in other systems (like thermal engines) in which variation in some parameters makes the velocity and the efficiency change in opposite directions. In other words, in this case no trade-off between efficiency and reaction velocity (and stability strength) need to be looked for, regarding the energy profile. We believe this may by one of the reasons why it has been possible for evolution to drive the structure of enzymes so the corresponding reaction velocity is increased by several orders of magnitude.
Let us begin by introducing the first generalised spin ladder model, whose Hamiltonian reads

The model that we analyze is a simple exactly soluble model which has relevance to some more realistic models as well. We assume that for times x0 ≤ t0, where t0 corresponds to a reference time, the system corresponds to a free scalar field theory of mass m in equilibrium at temperature T. A mass correction δm2 is introduced at time x0 = t0 and is present thereafter. Therefore, the Lagrangian density describing the system is given by

Otherwise, consider a separating pair {a, b} where a subtree Ti is attached to r(T). The two faces adjacent to the virtual edge (a, b) will be assigned circulation 2 × Kh(r(Ti)) × l(Ti). Similarly, consider a triplet {a, b, c} where a subtree Tj is attached. Then all the faces (at most 3) adjacent to the virtual triangle {a, b, c} get circulation 2 × Kh(r(Tj)) × l(Tj). Repeat this procedure for faces adjacent to all the pairs and/or triplets where subtrees are attached. If a face is adjacent to more than one virtual edge/triangle, then we just take the sum of different circulations due to each virtual edge/triangle.

Let Ql denote by the set of primes qi with βi + 1 is divisible by l. By assumption, any qi belongs to Ql for some l in P.
Since we are currently limiting ourselves to looking at the system in its probe approximation, the bending of spacetime due to any of the above M-branes need not be taken into account; in this section, the background is thus considered to be flat.

The receivers are conventional linear receivers, i.e., without multiuser detection. Since the transmissions occur simultaneously within the same environment, the signal from each transmitter acts as interference for other links. Assuming Gaussian signal transmission from all links, the distribution of the interference will be Gaussian as well. Thus, according to the Shannon capacity formula, the maximum supportable rate of link i ∈ A is obtained as

FIGURE 2
We proposed a new Bayesian method for robust compressed sensing. The rationale behind the proposed method is to identify the outliers and exclude them from sparse signal recovery. To this objective, a set of indicator variables were employed to indicate which observations are outliers. A beta-Bernoulli prior is assigned to these indicator variables. A variational Bayesian inference method was developed to find the approximate posterior distributions of the latent variables. Simulation results show that our proposed method achieves a substantial performance improvement over the compensation-based robust compressed sensing method.
Discussion
If, at the difference of MORPHS, we take into account the error on the morphological type, which is the dominant factor, in the computation of the error on the E to S0 ratio, then the MORPHS E to S0 ratios at different redshifts are equal within the errors. Therefore, we can conservatively state that there is, up to now, no evidences for a deficit of S0s in intermediate redshift clusters. The evolution of the cluster S0 population is not required by MORPHS data (or better, by the present analysis of the data).

We present here a discussion of a set of labs for the undergraduate level which provide first-hand experience with the basics of making images with aperture synthesis. Although a thorough mathematical explanation of the process would be helpful for the advanced students, these labs are designed to be stand-alone so that they can be completed without the mathematical lectures and still impart a general conceptual understanding to the lower level students.

Throughout all experiments, data points in a dataset are considered as players in games whose initial positions are taken from the dataset. Next, the network representing initial relationships among data points are created according to Definition 1, after a distance function is selected.

In the experiments, the distance function applied is as following:

The simplest implementation of the system studied would be a toy-like system of two masses tied-up to a spring sliding on a frictionless table with a carved well on it. Two atoms in a molecule scattering off an external Van-der-Waals potential might show the same effects in a quasi-classical approximation. However, quantum effects can blurr the picture due to interference.

With this choice, the SM particles can be collected in the first doublet and the new particles in the second one. Further, we take H1 , H2 as the mass eigenstates h0 , A0 respectively. Note that, at tree level, there is no mixing among CP even neutral Higgs bosons, namely the SM one, H0 , and beyond, h0 .
Measuring Machine Intelligence Through Visual Question Answering
The need for robust identifiers is even stronger on mobile devices. First, as above, Web sites wish to identify repeat visitors. Second, cloud-based services who develop mobile applications often need a robust phone identifier. Consider the following scenario: a user installs a cloud-based app and the app installs an identifier on the device. Later the user resets the device to its factory settings thereby deleting the app and its stored identifier. The user then re-installs the app and connects to the cloud service. At this point the service cannot tell whether it has already seen the device before. This simple trick may allow a misbehaving user whose account was blocked to reconnect to the service using a different identity.
