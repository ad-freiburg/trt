Thus there are physical problems with all of these models: the Comptonized disc cannot explain the narrow range in inferred temperatures, smeared reflection cannot produce the strongest soft excesses seen if the disc is in hydrostatic equilibrium, and smeared absorption requires a fast wind/jet which is not readily associated with the properties of any known component.

At microwave frequencies where complex reflection and transmission measurements (S-parameter) are common, it is difficult to characterize bianisotropic materials. This difficulty stems from the fact that these materials are necessarily described by the most general form of the constitutive relations. There may be 36 complex quantities to determine, and thus standard complex reflection and transmission measurements yield incomplete EM information. At THz and higher frequencies where phase sensitive measurements are not common it is even more difficult, although methods such as ellipsometry or THz time domain spectroscopy may prove useful. Further since a magnetic and electric resonant response enter similarly into the Fresnel equations, it is difficult to determine the origin of the response. Typically, artificial magnetic metamaterials are constructed from conducting elements, and thus a full electromagnetic characterization is a necessity, since an electric response is unavoidable. Analytical theories have yielded equations able to predict the resonant frequency ω0 and plasma frequency ωp of metamaterials. However there is a lack of suitable analytical methods capable of determining the many varying and complicated EM properties. Simulation is still heavily relied upon and, as of yet, is still unable to determine and distinguishing bianisotropic response.

In this paper, we have shown, that the first order phase transition and associated critical end point are driven by the chiral rather then deconfinement transition. The lines of both these transitions sit nearly atop the crossover associated with the remnants of the first order quarkyonic phase transitions of the large Nc limit. The critical end point itself may appear where the crossover from the quarkyonic and the deconfinement phase transitions intersect.

Most of the statistically steady runs produce a single, relatively large cyclone in a similar way. Its average size increases as bmax, and hence quasifriction, are reduced. Runs DI-12-16-64 and DI-12-16-∞, with bmax = 1/64 and 0, were terminated at t = 125yr because by then they had developed single cyclones large enough to produce an unrealistic, grossly nonzonal, footprint-dominated ζ structure.

To analyze our angle-integrated cross sections, we make a further simplification which is possible because the S11(1535) resonance is dominant near threshold. Therefore, we ignore the nonresonant amplitude. If one can isolate the contribution of a single S11 resonance to the E0+ multipole, the cross section takes a simple form,
Now we need a linear algebra lemma:

If we wish to generalise further, we need to develop the analogues of the uniqueness of the Jordan algebra. The proof we had in the separable case rested upon the uniqueness of the Cantor algebra. In the higher-dimensional case we cannot hope for that, but perhaps we can obtain uniqueness restricted to algebras that have the same dense set. This research brings us out of the scope of the present article and we plan it for the future work.

After the tip was mounted, the resonance full width at half maximum was about 5 Hz in air (1 Hz in vacuum). Its corresponding Q-value was about 104 in air (3×104 in vacuum). These Q-values were almost the same as those before the tip was mounted. We attribute the remarkably small change in the Q-values to the very small amount of glue used. Because the Q-value was roughly 100 times larger than that of a cantilever, it compensated for the high stiffness of the tuning fork in terms of the sensitivity.

In summary, an ultralow temperature point contact setup using nanopositioners was used to measure differential resistance of W/SRO point contact junctions. We find: 1) a superconducting gap around 0.2 mV and a dome like shape of conductance enhancement, consistent with chiral p-wave symmetry; 2) SC-like features persisting up to 6.2 K, much higher than the bulk Tc of SRO, presumably due to the pressure exerted by the W tip and a mechanism similar to that of the 3K-phase; 3) a broad resistance hump coexisting with superconductivity, which is ascribed to density of states effect due to 2D electron-electron interaction, consistent with the highly anisotropic electronic system of SRO. We believe PCS may provide useful information beyond the surface problem for SRO.
In conclusion, we have shown that the ZFC state is stable against current cycling in contrast to the FC state which is found to be metastable. This behavior is opposite to the thermal cycling where the FC state is stable. We also find that the defect density nd for any initial state converges to the same value at Ic.

Because of these limitations of our calibration, it is envisioned that the calibration results can be further refined in future studies, although we expect the main improvement to be a better constrained color term for the U band.

After identifying the plausible alignments to V- and J- genes, we turn to the problem of identifying D-gene matches. This is a more difficult problem because the D-genes are short, and deletions (occurring on both ends) often leave residual sequences which are hard to identify as a D-gene fragment. We therefore put very loose constraints on the D-gene alignments, relying on the probabilistic refinement to narrow them down. Specifically, we consider the read sequence segment lying between the end of the highest-scoring V-gene and the end of the highest-scoring J-gene, and include 10 nucleotides of flanking sequence on either side, to allow for ambiguous origin of these bases. We identify as a possible D-gene match every maximal non-overlapping alignment to this segment of the three D-gene alleles. These D-gene matches are scored by their length and the top 200 are selected as possible D-gene alignments.

Two typical sequences can be identified in the abundances of the various clusters: d, t, h, α at low baryonic density and d, t, α, h at the higher total baryonic density at which clusters are still present. Deviations from this behavior are found for lower temperature (T = 3.5 MeV) or higher proton fraction (Ypg = 0.5). In general, the dominant contribution comes from the deuterons. At very low density, the sequence reflects the ordering in size: the smaller clusters are more abundant. The difference between t and h, and more precisely the finding that tritons are more abundant than helions, is due to two effects: globally there are more neutrons available and, moreover, the triton is more bound. This last point explains why we find a difference among them also at Ypg = 0.5.

This fact strongly supports the correctness of the off-equilibrium approach for the computation of the q = 0 component of the propagator (including the effectiveness of the extrapolation procedure) and confirms that it is possible to compute equilibrium expectation values in off-equilibrium simulations. Moreover the double peak structure of the correlation function probability distribution survives in the infinite volume limit since the dynamical expectation values have been computed on a very large lattice (infinite to all practical effects). It is remarkable that the distribution probability of C(x) becomes wider with increasing x.

If for some linear function on a d-polytope with d + 3 vertices there is a monotone path through Mubt(d, d + 3) vertices, then the polytope is simple and dual-to-neighborly, and the linear function induces a Hamilton HK AOF. So for our problem we have to enumerate Hamilton HK AOFs on the graphs of dual-to-neighborly d-polytopes with d + 3 facets, which are in fact dual-to-cyclic in the case of even dimension.

We are now involved in planning a larger competition, together with A. Valencia and C.

We are planning two tasks; the first is the extraction of gene or protein names from text, so that we can evaluate the current state of the art in biological entity extraction across systems that have been reported in the literature over the past few years. The second task will require systems to associate Gene Ontology (GO) terms with mentions of proteins in articles curated in the SWISS-PROT database. Our experience in organizing the KDD competition leads us to believe that by using data from curated databases and focusing on tasks of immediate utility both to database curators and to researchers, we can define a good challenge evaluation for text data mining systems.

These strongly Yukawa coupling constants tend to an unitary constant as similar to the case in the soluble model but with smaller value.

We have found the zero-temperature phase diagram of a physical system whose relevant dynamics is captured by a nonlinear sigma model with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term and a Zeeman coupling to an external magnetic field. This dynamics corresponds to the continuous limit of an chiral ferromagnet on a square lattice.
Although our analyses yield directly a non-vanishing m(Φβ, k), we believe that it will also contribute to mphy (Φβ) in the analytically continued real-time propagator as well. Notice that in computing mphy, the scale k will be absorbed via a set of self-consistent equations.

The jet spectrum parametrization from this study is combined with a fragmentation function parametrization to predict the minimum-bias jet contribution to hadron spectra (spectrum hard component). Quantitative correspondence with data lends support to the jet production parametrization. The success of the jet-production model for p-p collision energies below 1 TeV and systematic deviations from the model at higher beam energies suggest that the eikonal model as a basis for jet production Monte Carlos is questionable at lower energies but may be applicable for higher jet and collision energies.

It is seen from Fig. 3 that our expectations, obtained from the visual analysis of SEM images, are basically correct: samples, which were sintered during an intermediate time, contain narrow gaps, which do not disappear completely during the fabrication process. These gaps become more and more narrow when moving away from the film surface towards its interior regions. Spacings between grains in films, which were heat-treated for a long time, tend to disappear and they shrink into grooves on the film surface, see Fig. 4(b), which shows such a groove separating two regions of the grain with different growth orientations.

The next step to our approach is to examine each node in terms of its possibility to be reached. Infeasible situations could be happened as the bounding boxes of objects in the scene may not be able to perfectly fit these structures and they often have irregular non-convex shapes. In addition, it is possible some obstacles and stable structures such as mountains, to be inserted between the slingshot and the target. Therefore, an examination step is required at each node so as to ensure that the corresponding trajectories can reach the target.
Finally, we recall the IMBH model which has spectral support from some sources (Miller et al 2004; the level of absorption in NGC 1275 is too high for any soft excess to be observed). They may form in dense star clusters.

A renewed interest in ultra-relativistic shocks as sites of efficient particle acceleration has been sparked by key observations in two areas:
Because the goal of this work was to detect fLSBs in the deepest band (R) and then to investigate the distribution of fLSBs in a color magnitude relation, we only used the R and B bands. We will use other bands (including U band data that we plan to acquire) to study spectrophotometric properties of fLSBs in a future work.
Scaling relations
It has been suggested (Sorrel 1990) that carbon is transformed into graphite in the ISM by an annealing process caused by the interstellar radiation field (ISRF). The SMC would, in that case, be a privileged site for graphite formation because the ISRF is greater there than in the Galaxy (Lequeux 1989). But that does not seem to be the case, since the UV bump is not generally observed.
Division of both sides by (1 + α)(1 + γ1) yields

This definition is a natural generalization of the Riemannian normal homogeneous space. Although in most cases the normal homogeneity is only referred to a compact coset space M = G/H of a compact Lie group G, the theory can be applied to some special non-compact coset spaces with very minor technical adjustment. Note that if G is a compact simple Lie group, then there exists a unique bi-invariant Riemannian metric on G (up to homotheties). However, there usually exists infinitely many bi-invariant Finsler metrics on a compact Lie group (up to homotheties), even for a compact simple Lie group. This implies that normal homogeneous Finsler metrics are not related to the group G as closely as in the Riemannian case. Hence the problem of this paper is much more difficult than the same problem in the Riemannian case.
Moreover, it is easily seen to be totally real and may be smoothed to C2+α.

(2004) state that the emission of X-rays can be obscured or modulated by accretion processes, but these are not the origin of the X-ray activity.

Additional model systematic uncertainties are attributed to the SM background MC generators described in section 3. An error of 20% on the normalisation of NC DIS, CC DIS and photoproduction processes with at least two high PT jets is considered to account for the uncertainty on higher order QCD corrections. The error on the elastic and quasi-elastic QED Compton cross sections is conservatively estimated to be 5%. The error on the inelastic QED Compton cross section is 10%. The errors attributed to lepton pair and W production are 3% and 15%, respectively. The total error on the SM background prediction is determined by adding the effects of all model and experimental systematic uncertainties in quadrature.

Numerical Methods
The spectra for the red giant #13414 were presented in KM11 and are based on observations with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) spectrograph at the 6.5-m Magellan2/Clay Telescope, yielding very high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios. This target is the only of the sample to comprise the reddest echelle order containing suitable and/or uncontaminated SI-lines (Sect. 2.1).
We use data from Open Street Maps (OSM) to identify possible routes and locations of turns and we find the route that best fits the given speed data. OSM data is in the form of nodes that are associated with different roads so a path will be a sequence of nodes. Each node has a physical location, given by a latitude and longitude, allowing us to determine distances between segments of road and the turning angle of a path of nodes.
While it is certainly less restrictive to assume infinite precision for the average values of the coefficients rather than the coefficients themselves, it is still unclear whether this assumption on the average values could be satisfied. (The in-principle unsatisfiability of this, on the other hand, would imply that we can never, as a matter of fundamentals, get rid of systematic, as opposed to statistical, errors.) Note also that in order to apply the central limit theorem we need to have a finite variance for the algorithm outputs. But, as the outputs (xi, yi) for randomly distributed inputs (ui, vi) may not be bounded from above, it is yet to be shown that the former could have a finite variance even if the latter does.

In this paper, we focused on approaches for cleaning inconsistent web data. We showed that the current state of the art approaches, which learn and use conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) to rectify data, do not work well with web data as they demand clean master data for training. We proposed a fully probabilistic framework for cleaning data that involved learning both the generative and error (corruption) models of the data and using them to clean the data. For generative models, we learn Bayes networks from the data. For error models, we consider a maximum entropy framework for combing multiple error processes. The generative and error models are learned directly from the noisy data. Preliminary experimental results on web data showed that our probabilistic approach is able to reduce errors in the data long after CFD-based methods fail to be effective.
For a fermion field the result for the effective scale factor is almost identical to the scalar case

As previously mentioned, E obtains a small gain for each time-step an honest node is within the network, and a small loss for each time-step a malicious node remains in the network. Formally, we can write that the total gain G we obtain from some node i, which E removes at time N, and which would voluntarily leave at time H is:
Thus, the ambiguity in the choice of the hadronic continuum threshold and the parameter of the sum rule scheme essentially reduces the reliability of the QCD sum rule predictions for the leptonic constants of the vector and pseudoscalar Bc states.

Let P be a simple polygon in the plane, that is, a closed region bounded by a piece-wise linear, simple cycle. A triangulation T of P is a geometric (straight-line) maximal outerplanar graph whose outer face is the complement of P and whose vertex set consists of the vertices of P. The edges of T that are not on the outer face are called diagonals. Let d be a diagonal whose removal creates a convex quadrilateral f. Replacing d with the other diagonal of f yields another triangulation of P. This operation is called a flip. The flip graph of P is the abstract graph whose vertices are the triangulations of P and in which two triangulations are adjacent if and only if they differ by a single flip. We study the flip distance, i.e., the minimum number of flips required to transform a given source triangulation into a target triangulation.

Almost every evening, we were ambulating around the big lawn in front of the dining room, trying to reconstruct, at his request, the arguments which produce the existence of 27 straight lines on an unruled third degree surface. That was a prelude to his later work on enumerative geometry.

Application to physical problems involving material points
Soon after General Relativity (GR) was first introduced, several attempts to form alternative theories of gravity where made. Some of the most interesting were those based on an effort to build a more general theory by dropping one or more of the several assumptions of GR, like the fact that the only degrees of freedom of the gravitational field are those of the metric, or the simplicity choice that the gravitational Lagrangian should be a linear function of the scalar curvature.
This study was made with two complementary approaches: CMD fitting and full spectrum fitting. The first method uses CMDs usually obtained with HST/ACS, while the last uses long slit spectra that can be acquired on a ground based telescope. The two methods are consistent and it is notable that the full spectrum fitting can give finer constrains on the metallicity. In full spectrum fitting, the metallicity is directly constrained by the metal absorption lines from the stars, while CMDs rely on broad bands colours and on stellar evolution models. It is the first time that a detailed spectroscopic determination of the SFH was successfully applied to low surface brightness galaxy (with low S/N data).
therefore, we can concentrate on C+ (B). Our main result is stated as follows.

Our second argument in favor of our program has two parts: first we show that a necessary requirement for self-consistency of the renormalization program is that all of the internal propagators have to be of the same form. Second we show that in the process of connecting the internal and external propagators through the internal points immediately adjacent to the external ones, the requirement of consistency mandates that all of the propagators have to be of the same form. Since the external propagators by definition have to be consistent with the non-perturbative conditions on the system, we conclude that all of the propagators and the resulting counter-terms have to be of such form.
In summary, the contributions of this paper are three-fold.

Further development of descriptions of geometric shape and topological structure, as well as algorithms for their computation will provide a solid foundation for studying many important biological problems. The other important tasks are then to show how these descriptors may be effectively used to deepen our biological insights and to develop accurate predictive models of biological phenomena. For example, in computing protein-protein interfaces, a challenging task is to discriminate surfaces that are involved in protein binding from other non-binding surface regions, and to understand in what fashion this depends on the properties of the binding partner protein.

The predicted minimal value, Rψγ(min) = 1.65, does not contradict the Belle measurements with Rψγ (Belle) < 2.1.

Next, we consider accretion disk effects in more realistic waveform models. EMRI GWs are highly relativistic, with velocities close to the speed of light and sometimes skimming the SMBH horizon. As such, Newtonian waveform estimates for GW data analysis are inaccurate. Here we investigate the relativistic correction to the EMRI dynamics using the extended one body framework, and make simple estimates on the imprint of accretion disk effects on the GW waveform. This analysis, however, continues to neglect relativistic corrections to accretion disk effects.
At the AdS minimum, the gravitino mass, of order AdS curvature, is also set by the perturbation f,

We also address the validity of using an effective theory. We find that for light DM masses (below a few hundred GeV), the bound derived using an effective theory may be accurate to about 10%. If the mediator is heavy, but below a couple TeV, the limit derived from effective theory is in fact conservative, and the true limit is stronger. But, if the mediator is too light to decay to dark matter pairs the true limit is far weaker than the one derived from effective theory. In addition, we find that the effective theory breaks down at DM masses that are heavy enough such that the DM production is kinematically suppressed by PDFs, and we must take into account the UV physics in these cases.

In this paper we use numerical simulations to study the transport of differently prepared vortex systems. Our first main result is that, in contrast to the temperature cycling, if the vortex system is cycled with a transport current, then the ZFC state is more stable than the FC state. In particular, the ZFC state can be reached from the FC state by current cycling, but not vice versa. Our second main result is that, with increasing currents, all vortex states, FC, ZFC, or prepared in any intermediate way, acquire an unique density of defects at depinning.
Since this is true for each ε, the lemma holds.

Any process of inelastic scattering (that is the scattering with new particles produced) can be characterized by the function Pn, the multiplicity distribution function. The value of Pn denotes the probability to observe n particles produced in the collision. It is clear that Pn must be normalized to unity:

Both migration scenarios require the presence of additional companion(s) in the system. High-eccentricity migration mechanisms require a massive, not very distant perturber to bring the warm Jupiter into a Kozai-Lidov cycle, type II migration requires multiple planets to clear a wide inner hole and prematurely stop the migration of the planet. KOI-614b is thus an interesting candidate for future observations with the aim of finding additional low-mass, short-period planetary companions or a more distant and massive perturber.

These examples also show that outliers, in the functional sense, are not simply the result of misrecorded data or extreme noise. They correspond to individuals that, for some reason, do not follow the pattern of the majority of the data, and often deserve to be studied more carefully rather than simply discarded. However, these atypical curves must be downweighted at the estimation step, or they may lead to erroneous conclusions for the rest of the population.
Finally, for faint objects (SNR around 1 per spectral channel), electromagnetic interferences in the VLTI interferometric laboratory with the detector electronics prevents currently to get unbiased measurements. Ideas are under study to correct in the data processing side this effect, but a hardware fix should be investigated seriously since it limits seriously the effective limiting magnitude of the instrument.

The total energy of a nucleus is given by E = Enucl + ECoul + ECM, where Enucl, ECoul and ECM are the contributions from nuclear, Coulomb and center-of-mass correction, respectively. The nuclear part of the energy for an effective interaction is given by,
One of the lessons of statistical mechanics is that in an extensive system of variables, with short range interactions, at generic choices of parameters the correlations decay exponentially. The correlation length is typically not much greater than the range of the interaction, and it is only in the vicinity of critical points that correlations exhibit structures of much greater scales. For a field theory based on local interactions, the interaction range vanishes on the scale of the continuum limit. Hence, in a constructive approximation, for which convergence is accomplished through ultraviolet cutoffs, the underlying system of the local variables needs to be very near a critical point. Some familiarity with critical phenomena is, therefore, essential for the understanding of a continuum field theory.

At one-loop level the presence of the new quartic terms in the Lagrangian does not affect the propagators and the 1PI functions which enter the computation of the beta-functions for the Yukawa coupling constant λ. So we expect to find the same βλ as in the N = 1 case. Similarly, since the one-loop beta function for the gauge coupling depends only on the field content of the model, which is kept the same as in N = 4, we reproduce the βg = 0 result of N = 4 case.
In this subsection instead of fixing the mass M we fix the density λ > 0. Let V(x, y, z; ρ) be the potential induced by the fixed homogeneous circle, contained in the xy-plane, centered at the origin, with constant density λ and with radius ρ.
To describe the evolution of the classical field σ during inflation we must specify the different phases of inflation. We thus write the total length of inflation as

If C has genus zero, then C and L have no moduli, and hence the measure just described can serve as a measure on M. For C of positive genus, C and L do have moduli. It is not at all clear what sort of measure should be used to integrate over those moduli, so at the moment there is not a clear framework for higher genus computations in twistor space. For this reason, in section 3, when we verify parity invariance of the scattering amplitudes in a precise fashion, we consider only the contributions from curves of genus zero. However, an important part of the calculation can be carried out for arbitrary genus, as we will now see.

To recapitulate, we studied analytically and numerically the dynamics of the apparent reflection point at the overdense plasma surface. We have shown that the velocity of this point is a smooth function of time. However, the corresponding γ-factor has quasi-singularities or spikes when the surface velocity approaches the speed of light. These ultra-relativistic spikes are responsible for the high harmonic generation in the form of an attosecond pulse train. We show that the attosecond pulse emission can be efficiently controlled by managing the laser polarization. This is done by adding a low intensity control pulse with perpendicular polarization and frequency slightly different from that of the driving pulse. This relativistic plasma control allows to gate a single attosecond pulse or a prescribed group of attosecond pulses.
Missed detection and false alarms are traded off by an arbitrary choice of threshold, as in any detection algorithm.
A tree node of an evolutionary network N = (V, E) is a node of in-degree at most 1, and a hybrid node is a node of in-degree at least 2. A tree arc (hybridization arc) is a path such that the start vertex is a tree node (hybrid node). As in tree, a node v ∈ V is a child of u ∈ V if (u, v) ∈ E, we also say in this case that u is a parent of v, note that in this case a node can have more than one parent.
In deriving the above, we have used kinematic relations
The PDPs achieved by different ARQs are shown in Fig. 1. In general, a higher EH rate is needed in order to meet a higher throughput requirement. Also, with a larger K, i.e., the maximum number of transmission attempts, the system has the potential to achieve a smaller PDP, but the throughput requirement becomes more difficult to satisfy. Besides, when the throughput constraint is met, ARQ without feedback and ARQ with adaptive feedback achieve the same performance under the optimal policies. This is because each packet uses all the transmission attempts to avoid packet drop, and the proposed ARQ protocol reduces to the ARQ without feedback. From this set of results, we can draw new design insights for communication systems with EH receivers:
So, the linear infinitely long current, lineary growing with time, produces around a stationary electrical field parallel to itself, growing logarithmically with a distance from the current.
The currently available (2dFGRS, SDSS) and next generation (e.g. BOSS) large galaxy redshift surveys in combination with the analytical formalism presented in this paper, will allow us to estimate the values of the relevant cosmological parameters using void statistics, providing independent measurements. These, along with the estimations made by other methods will contribute to reduce their uncertainties. It is also worth to mention that in a forthcoming paper we will explore the dependence of the statistics of voids with σ8 and Γ, using the void statistics found in the 2dFGRS (Patiri et al., in prep.). All this makes the statistics of underdense regions a very promising tool to constrain cosmology not just with the current surveys but also to next generation high redshift surveys.

In these conditions ion trapping or eddying appears. As we have shown this strongly influences the statistics of trajectories. The distribution of the trajectories is not more Gaussian due to trapped trajectories that form quasi-coherent structures. At this stage the trapping is weak in the sense that the fraction of trapped trajectories ntr is much smaller than the fraction nf of free trajectories.

The purpose of this section is to prove the following result:
We consider the stability of filamentary molecular clouds against axisymmetric fragmentation into cores. By solving the linearized equations of MHD and self-gravity, we determine how pressure truncation and the individual magnetic field components affect the stability of our models. We find that pressure truncation has a stabilizing effect, which results from the decreased mass per unit length of the filament. Both field components also stabilize clouds against gravitational fragmentation. However, we find that sufficiently strong toroidal fields may trigger MHD-driven instabilities. We refer the reader to Fiege & Pudritz (1999b), where we fully explore the stability of our models.
We notice that for bound state (real) solutions, the last equation requires that

Conversely, by cutting the two upward branches from the lowest internal vertex, each n-tree ψ can be uniquely represented as the grafting of two trees, say, ψ1 ∈ Tp and ψ2 ∈ Tq, where p + q = n.

We have investigated the brachistochrone problem for entangled states. This answers the question that we have raised in the beginning, namely, given an arbitrary product state and general non-local Hamiltonian, what is the minimum time for creating a desired entangled state? We have shown that the minimum time depends inversely on the speed of the evolution of the quantum system. This is independent of the particular entanglement measure and holds even for multiparticle entangled systems. We have shown that for two qubits the presence of initial entanglement does help in minimising the waiting time. In particular, we find that if we are given an option of starting from a product state and an entangled state, and wants to reach the maximally entangled state, then it is better to start from some already initial entangled state. Because, in the later case the time required is less. We have shown that the time average of entanglement rate depends on the Schmidt rank and on the fluctuation in the non-local Hamiltonian. We have also shown that in a bilocal rotating frame the entangling capability is also directly related to the speed of the evolution of the entangled states. This shows that the entangling capability of a non-local Hamiltonian is actually a geometric quantity. Furthermore, we have proved a composition law for the minimum time when the system evolves under composite Hamiltonians. We hope that these findings will be of interest in understanding the entanglement rate and entangling capabilities of non-local Hamiltonians and in real experimental situations. In future, it will be interesting to see if all these findings also hold for qudits and multiparticle systems.

Nowadays the concept that the tidal braking effect of the earth rotation is caused by the gravitational force of the moon acting on the viscous oceanic waters around the earth is accepted in general.

Our work is an addition to the very limited literature on both pricing with negative network externalities and iterative pricing. The model captures many interesting settings in real-world marketing, and is usually much more challenging than the positive externality counterpart. The hardness result identifies complexity status of a fundamental pricing problem. The algorithms achieve satisfactory performances in general and several important special settings. An interesting direction for future research is to narrow the lower and upper bounds on the approximability of the iterative pricing problem with negative externality. Obtaining more accurate estimations for the optimal pricing is a key to reduce the approximation ratios.
Finally, we will make use of:

This paper has described the minimal effective field theory formalism needed to explore the low-energy implications of a 3-brane universe. It appears relatively straightforward to generalize the present framework in several directions, for example, adding non-minimal bulk fields, making the formalism supersymmetric, considering more complicated spacetime topologies, or considering more than one brane embedded in the bulk spacetime.
Conclusion
N=2 Supersymmetric Composite Abelian Higgs model
The immediate objection to Golden is the use of irrational numbers and the possibility of computer error due to truncation. Using 64 bit long and 64 bit double in Java, Golden failed at F75, differing by 1 in the last digit from AC, which failed at F93 from overflow. Note that a double has fewer digits than a long of the same computer bit size representation, so part of this failure is a practical limitation due to the representation of reals in the computer. In Table 1, assuming no truncation error, the predicted maximum with an effective mantissa of 53 bits is at n = 76, the actual maximum, including truncation error, is at n = 74. Assuming additional space, Golden works correctly for any n.

This procedure is perfectly well defined, even when rings enter and leave through the same faces of the cell (see also S.I.). We emphasise that this is taken to be a definition of threading. It is necessarily a strictly local measure, on the scale of the cell volume. If the cell volume is increased no threadings will eventually be recorded since rings in the melt are unlinked by construction.
Only the spherical morphological type is studied here. We conclude that most probably there is a large population of spherical PNs, much more than non-spherical PNs, that are too faint to be detected. This leads to a new estimate regarding the distribution of PN progenitors and different PN morphology types (summarized in sections 1 and 2). The new estimates compared with previous ones are summarized in Table 1.

For simplicity in this exploratory research, we make the approximation that the force constants coupling the substrate atoms are insensitive to the chemical species. Therefore, varying the superlattice composition is achieved simply by altering the mass matrix M. For real systems, the mass modulation accounts for the majority of the effect, with compositionally varying force constants contributing essentially no new physics.

In the present work, we have investigated the impact that these specific realizations of the interacting DE scenario have on the rotation curves of luminous spiral galaxies. More specifically, we have restricted our analysis to a particular class of coupled DE scenarios characterized by a steep growth in time of the interaction strength, parametrized as a positive power of the cosmic scale factor. Such models have been shown to be in full agreement with present constraints on the background evolution of the Universe, as they do not feature the typical early DE scaling of other coupled DE scenarios like e.g. models with a constant or a more slowly evolving coupling function. The background evolution of the models investigated in this work is in fact practically indistinguishable from the standard ΛCDM cosmology. Furthermore, the impact of these alternative cosmologies on the statistical properties of large scale structures is confined at very low redshifts, which makes it problematic to test the models via e.g. weak lensing measurements.
We could have extended this symmetry breaking pattern to the case where we have two sets of vector representations, φa1 and φa2. The invariant spin connection can depend on the length of each Lorentz vector and the angle between them, |φa1 |, |φa2 |, and |φa1φa2 |. The solutions for the minimum must be obtained from the conditions imposed on these three quantities. We can choose φa1 with only the last component non-zero and φa2 with the last two components non-zero in order to satisfy these conditions. The Lorentz SO(3, 1) symmetry is then broken down to O(2) (or U(1)) symmetry44.

Comments on the condensation temperature in the interacting case
Let us describe the scheme mathematically and follow up with a simple example. Along symmetry lines and planes in the Brillouin zone, there exist symmetry operations for each k that form a group. For each such group the irreducible representations Γp can be found, and can be used to block-diagonalize the secular equation,
The plot of power against Type I error rate is sometimes known as the Receiver Operating Characteristic, or ROC, the name arising from its origin in radar. It is used a good deal in medicine (e.g. Zweig & Campbell 1993). A useful quantity could be the integral under the ROC curve, known as the AUC (Area Under the Curve). In our application, it is not difficult to show that the AUC is the probability that the evidence ratio, assuming H1, exceeds the evidence ratio, assuming H0. This condenses the ROC into a single number, which for our examples is quite close to unity. This may be a useful compression in some cases, but it does lose the possibility of ascribing weight to the degree by which the evidence ratios exceed each other.
At one-loop order the fermionic contribution to the energy can be rewritten as

Disentangling the dielectric properties of pristine graphite from the effects of size, shape, orientation, agglomeration and aggregation requires inverting the mathematical operations of Rouleau and Martin, which is obviously a very tricky business.

Since the heart of this pathing problem is the lack of turn information one approach is to treat this as a classification problem. Here, we examine the speed traces to extract features: stop, right turn, left turn, or straight road. If classification would work well, we can assign probabilities to different choices at each intersection and eventually find the highest probability path. However, road conditions and driving habits are very diverse. With our data set we were unable to classify turn features with high enough accuracy to build correct paths. The sheer volume of paths to explore meant that unless the correct path was extremely different from all of the incorrect paths, the algorithm would find some incorrect paths that looked just as good, or better, than the correct path.

In the remainder, we always refer to some arbitrary node in the network and thus make no distinction between nodes. This is because the algorithms that we examine, consider each node independently of the others. Consequently, the following section analyses the expected loss for a single node of unknown type.

The appearance of rings, ringlenses and lenses is not very sensitive to galaxy luminosity. However, while lumping together the outer lenses (L) and ring lenses (RL) they appear more frequently among the fainter galaxies (32±5% vs. 19±4% in the two galaxy luminosity bins, respectively; Table 3, ). Also, the inner rings (r,rs) appear more frequently among the fainter galaxies (20±4% vs. 3±2%, in the two bins, respectively). The tendencies are similar if only the barred galaxies are considered (Table 6).

A DAG model encodes conditional independence relationships via the notion of d-separation. Several DAGs could encode the same set of conditional independence relationships. These DAGs form an equivalence class, consisting of DAGs with the same skeleton and v-structures. A complete partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG) uniquely describes such an equivalence class. In fact, directed edges in the CPDAG are common to all DAGs in the equivalence class. Undirected edges in the CPDAG correspond to edges that are directed one way in some DAGs and another way in other DAGs of the equivalence class. The absence of edges in the CPDAG means that all DAG members in the equivalence class have no corresponding edge. If all the conditional independence relationships of a distribution P and no additional conditional independence relations, can be inferred from the graph, we say that the distribution P is faithful to the DAG G. More precisely, if P is faithful to the DAG G: for any triple of disjoint sets A, B and S in V,

Introduction and main result
In the literature there have been some attempts to use finite nonabelean groups to describe the family repetition structure. Usually, representations are considered to model the generations, and a complicated Higgs sector is constructed to account for the observed mass differences between the fermions. In my opinion, this does not really solve the mass problem but just shifts it to another level. It would be much more desirable to understand the fermion masses dynamically, in the model at hand, for example, by understanding the differences between the bindings of preons 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Although there has been some progress on the above mentioned potential system architectures and advanced techniques for fronthaul constrained C-RANs, there are still many challenges ahead, including C-RANs with SDN, C-RANs with NFV, partially centralized C-RANs, standards development, field trials, etc. Since the C-RAN standards developments in 3GPP are still not open, and the corresponding field trials for 5G systems are far in the future, this section will discuss the aforementioned first three challenges.

General conclusions
Due to the intermittent and sporadic nature of EH, the reception policies should be carefully designed in order to maximize the system performance. In this section, a throughput constrained PDP minimization problem will be formulated, and its optimal solution will be developed in Section IV.

It is instructive to look at the way an eigenfunction at a given parameter value (α, β) is turned into the second-next higher state after the rotation around the singularity. In Fig. IV, an example of such wave-function morphology is displayed. One essential feature is the node change which occurs at the crossing of β = 0 line. On this line, the system is separated into the non-communicating two subsystems at x = 0 because of the infinite value of δ. The reason of nodal change is that the approach to β = 0 line from the β > 0 side and β < 0 side are physically distinct because they each correspond to δ = ±∞ and δ = ∓∞ respectively. (The composite signs are for the case of αγ0 > 1 and αγ0 < 1 respectively, in turn.) Yet, at β = 0 line, two cases get connected smoothly.

Such segregation of ices is indicated by solid CO observations towards a sample of low-mass protostars showing evidence that 60% to 90% of solid CO is in the form of pure CO-ice (Tielens et al. 1991, Boogert et al. 2002, Pontopiddan et al. 2003). Likewise, observations of solid CO2 also provide evidence for separate ice components along the same line of sight, although, in this case, this is generally attributed to the segregation of mixed H2O/CH3OH/CO2 ices upon warm up by a newly formed star (Ehrenfreund et al. 1998; 1999; Gerakines, Moore & Hudson 2000; Boogert et al. 2000).

In this letter we have examined the consequences of feedback from an early episode of SN explosions in proto-galaxies. An extension of the mechanism proposed by Dekel & Silk (1986), to higher velocity dispersion halos yields a modulation of the baryon fraction available for disk formation that depends on the depth of the potential well. This feedback applied to simple prescriptions for disk formation implies that the either the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher or the mass-to-light ratio is weakly dependent on the velocity dispersion of the halo. The implications of this scenario for the Milky Way disk are that approximately 10% of the original gas that fell in was expelled prior to disk assembly, a high-redshift of formation which is in good agreement with the ages of the oldest thick disk stars is inferred for average to high values of the spin parameter of the Milky Way halo with a local baryon fraction that ranges from the universal value of 5% to a value of 20% which is what is inferred from X-ray studies of the Intra-cluster medium in clusters of galaxies.
The first solution procedure is a sequential one, where one first computes grid values of the cost function and then carry out the optimization procedure by employing the approximate values interpolated from the grid. It is important to note that all the grid values provide the design or control variables along with the corresponding mechanical state variables of displacements and rotations which must satisfy the weak form of equilibrium equation. In other to ensure this requirement, for any grid value of design or control variables one also has to solve associated nonlinear problem in structural mechanics.

Outlook
It is thus just as well that the only candidates we can see for quantities that might be calculable with arbitrary precision are the meta-observables, which extend beyond any one horizon. Since the horizon volume (after a limited number of inflationary e-foldings) does not contain a living observer anyway, any precisely calculable quantities associated with the interior of a horizon would be wasted.

which show that a sufficient number of sextet fields may guarantee a g4 running almost identical with that of gL,R. The string model we are proposing in the next section has exactly one mirror pair and four sextet fields, whereas additional exotic states may also contribute to the beta functions if they remain in the light spectrum.

The boundary of the fluid ξb is defined by p(ξb) = 0.

The idea behind these series of open evaluations has been to attract teams to work on a problem by providing them with real (or realistic) training and test data, as well as objective evaluation metrics. These data sets are often hard to obtain, and the open evaluation makes it much easier for groups to build systems and compare performance on a common problem. If many teams are involved, the results are a measure of the state-of-the-art for that task. In addition, when the teams share information about their approaches and the evaluations are repeated over time, then the research community can demonstrate measurable forward progress in a field.

In summary, we have demonstrated evident bias-current dependence of the spin accumulation in a semiconducting Si channel at 25 K by measuring the Hanle-effect signals. We have observed that the electrical detectability of the Hanle-effect signals at the forward-biased contact is higher than that at the reverse-biased contact. This work indicates possible evidence for the detection of spin-polarized electrons created not in the localized state in the vicinity of the interface but in a Si channel.

Appendix
In the quiet-Sun magnetic networks, cavities are important locations where the magnetic fields are sufficiently inclined due to their well evolved horizontal components. They are formed over the granular cells in form of the field-free regions due to the transport of plasma at their boundaries and overlaid by bipolar magnetic canopies. The vertical magnetic fields, however, reside mostly in the core of such magnetic networks (Schrijver & Title, 2003; Centeno et al., 2007). Such magnetic cavity-canopy systems are thought to be ideal resonators of the various MHD waves that can be trapped in the cavity, as well can also leak in form of the magnetoacoustic-gravity waves upward through the core of such magnetic networks. It is thought that the field-free cavity regions underlying the bipolar canopy can trap the high-frequency acoustic oscillations, and the low-frequency components may leak into the higher atmosphere in form of magnetoacoustic-gravity waves (Kuridze et al., 2008; Srivastava et al., 2008; Srivastava, 2010). Therefore, such magnetic structures in the lower solar atmosphere are the regions that may play an important role in the wave filtering (e.g. McIntosh & Judge, 2001; Krijger et al., 2001; McAteer et al., 2002; Vecchio et al., 2007, 2009; Srivastava, 2010, and references therein).

We first return to a point briefly mentioned earlier in the paper about a difference in the UPB construction which appears when orthogonal UPBs are replaced by generalized UPBs. In the former case the PPT property follows directly from the projection form of ρ, since this implies also ρP to be proportional to a projection, and therefore to be positive. With the use of a generalized UPB, we have no proof for this to be the case. Clearly the UPB construction will be simpler if we only have to take into account conditions that apply to ρ and not to both ρ and ρP, and for that reason we shall examine this point a bit further.
To reason about convergence of probabilistic processes, we will use the total variation distance on distributions (also known as statistical distance).

These calculations demonstrate that luminosity and temperature of protostars not only depend on mass and age, but also on the accretion rate in the main accretion phase. Therefore, the position of a protostar on the HR diagram is sensitive to the cluster environment, because stochastic core interaction and competition strongly influence the mass accretion rate: PMS tracks are not unique, and mass (or similarly age) of individual protostars from using the HR diagram can only be determined in a statistical sense.
Nonminimal torsion-matter coupling extension of f(T) gravity
When fitting a simple modified black-body model to the data, we must keep in mind that there is a partial degeneracy between β and Td and, more importantly, a perfect degeneracy between Td and z. The peak of the SED is determined by the ν/Td term in the exponential, so that a measurement of the colours alone constrains only the ratio (1 + z)/Td. However, assuming reasonable priors on the free parameters of the SED model (in our case, β and Td) it is still possible to estimate a qualitative redshift distribution for our sample of sources. Alternatively, if secure redshifts are known from optical cross-identifications, we can determine the dust temperatures.

A graph H is a minor of a graph G if a graph isomorphic to H can be constructed from G by vertex deletion, edge deletion and edge contraction. Edge contraction means to take an edge vw and replace v and w with a new vertex x adjacent to all vertices originally adjacent to v or w. If H is a minor of G, say that G has an H-minor.

In order to rescue the applicability of perturbative methods, one must resort once again to factorization, coupled with asymptotic freedom. One exploits the quantum-mechanical incoherence of processes happening at different distance scales to show that high-energy inclusive cross sections can be written as convolutions of short-distance finite partonic cross sections, which can be computed in perturbation theory thanks to asymptotic freedom, with long-distance factors (parton distributions or fragmentation functions), which are non-perturbative but universally associated with hadronic wave functions.

The weight matrix W was assumed to be diagonal with per-detector variances determined every half hour from the time stream model residuals. Imaging fainter extended sources will benefit from a more accurate treatment.

These compact schemes for the first and second derivatives show better spectral accuracy then their explicit counterparts. However, they involve solving tridiagonal matrix equations and are therefore effectively non-local. This requires special care for designing parallel computations. However, in this study, we focus on a single domain without domain decomposition, and so the compact schemes can be adopted easily.
In this section, we will calculate a upper bound on the number of isomorphism class of transversals under some condition on the pair (G, H) and as a particular case we determine it for a non-normal subgroup of order p in a non-abelian group of order pq, where q > p and p and q are prime numbers and also for a non-normal subgroup of order two of a Dihedral group.

The paper is organized as follows. The second chapter introduces the variational formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation from which the drift can be derived by minimization of a functional. The third chapter shows how a regularized empirical approximation of the functional leads to a nonparametric estimate. The fourth chapter presents examples of this estimator for the class of Langevin equations for which the extra conditions lead to only mild restrictions. The fifth chapter explains how the method can be extended to other types of noise, such as jump processes. We conclude with a discussion and possible extensions of the method in chapter six.

We compare the situation to the other channels: In the case of two leading gluonic reggeons we would have instead a factor |κ | 4 and in the case of two subleading reggeons no additional factors of κ. In both cases no double log contribution from the soft κ region appears.

The extraction of the above mentioned information from the experimental data suffers from several difficulties which arise due to the complexity of the reaction mechanism. The ideal situation occurs when the reaction mechanism can be explained with very simple models. In this article we use a simple and tractable model for the reaction mechanisms and apply it to the study of the scattering of unstable beams. Under some circumstances it is shown that our model can be very useful to extract the ground state properties of exotic nuclei. A study of this feature is presented in sections 3 and 4. A brief explanation of the calculation ground state densities for exotic nuclei is done in section 3. These densities are used as inputs in the calculation of the elastic cross sections, which are compared to some available experimental data in section 4. To show the feasibility of the models used, we also compare the theoretical predictions with some experimental data for reactions with stable nuclei.

From the previous analysis we have seen that the size of the clusters very likely plays a dominant role in the distribution of the different populations as a function of the radius of the merged system. To shed light on this dependence, we present in this section a second set of simulations which are identical to the previous set presented before but for the radii of the two clusters, which we fix to 3 pc in the two clusters. We follow the structure of the first set of simulations and use different W0 parameters (W01 and W02): 3, 6, 9 and 12 for the two clusters. This gives 16 possible combinations and this time we perform two realisations per combination, which makes in total 32 simulations. We set all other setup parameters (IMF, orbital parameters, age) identical to the first set, so as to be able to understand the role of the size and King parameter more clearly.
From the above descriptions, it is clear that Di (i = 1, 2, 3) are normal crossing smooth divisors.

In summary, we have measured the quantum dynamics of a single H2 molecule in the confined geometry of a water clathrate nanocavity. An isotropic model describes quantitatively the main features of the motion, were coupling between rotational and c.o.m. dynamics are weak, reproducing frequencies and intensities of the observed spectrum. The splitting of the rotational and translational bands is a consequence of the anisotropy of the environment, which must be modeled with greater accuracy than done until now, to extract direct information on the basic interaction between H2 and H2O molecules.

In the absence of any positive evidence for the presence of significant quantities of He in the atmosphere of NLTT 43806, we treat the star as having an H-dominated atmosphere; Giammichele, Bergeron, & Dufour (in preparation), find a very good fit to the Hα line profile plus (SDSS and 2MASS) ugriz+JHK photometry for a log g = 8 (fixed), 5900 K pure hydrogen model. Our high-resolution HIRES spectra demonstrate the weakly magnetic nature of NLTT 43806 (Figures 2-4). We used an analysis similar to that described in Section 3.2 of Farihi et al (2011b) and found a good fit to the line profiles with a uniform B field of 70 kG (Section 3). This field is too weak to effect the determination of the atmospheric parameters derived by Giammichele et al. NLTT 43806 thus joins a few other known weakly magnetic white dwarfs that are polluted with heavy elements: G77-50, G165-7, LHS 2534, and LTT 8381.

This could be a very important issue for thick-walled Q-balls, which necessitate φc <<φ0 so that we are already stretching the one-loop running to the limits of applicability. If we want to have a truer idea of the Q-ball binding energy, we should try to make use of the renormalization group, or at the very least move to two-loop running. This has not been attempted in the numerical simulations to date, however. Therefore, let us consider the consequences of assuming simple one-loop running holds over a large range of φ.

The observationally complete sample size of the main belt asteroids (excluding members of collisional families) is now more than 64,000, a nearly 80-fold increase over the past century. We undertook a careful statistical analysis of the eccentricities of this sample and their interpretation with simple physical models. We obtained the following results.

In Fig. 1 we illustrate some of the representative phases that occur with increasing density in the presence of the quenched disorder. In Fig. 1(a) at density n = 0.013, the particles form a uniform phase of single charges. In Fig. 1(b) at n = 0.06, the system is comprised of heterogeneous arrangements of disordered clumps. For higher density, such as n = 0.15 shown in Fig. 1(c), the system forms a disordered labyrinth pattern. At very high densities the system returns to a uniform phase with considerable crystalline order as seen in Fig. 1(d) for n = 0.34. The heterogeneous phases occur for 0.05 < n < 0.34.

Introduction
Only the roots on the middle node of the Dynkin diagram (u2 roots) carry energy and momentum. The other two types of roots are auxiliary. They just change the flavor composition of the state. These roots are fermionic in the sense that adding an odd number of u1 and u3 roots produces a fermion.

The tight empirical relationship between radio and far-IR luminosities for star-forming galaxies allows us to take advantage of the wealth of data at far-IR/sub-mm wavelengths to derive the radio evolution properties. We expect a different evolution for starburst and normal late-type galaxies as the starburst activity is likely triggered by interactions and mergers that were more frequent in the past, while in normal galaxies the star-formation rate has probably not changed much over their lifetimes. The bulk of the sub-mm counts measured by SCUBA surveys (Scott et al. 2006; Coppin et al. 2006) is due to yet another population, the sub-mm galaxies (SMGs), interpreted as proto-spheroidal galaxies in the process of forming most of their stars (Granato et al. 2004).

The independence of the shape of the microlensing portrait of the line on the system parameters could be understood in simple terms if one uses a toy model of the accretion disk based on the Newtonian gravity instead of the GR (or an alternative theory of gravity).

We then demonstrate the following interesting phenomenon: There exist many games in which the contribution vector does not matter, since the players can perform rotations, by alternating between being first and second author on joint projects. Rotations can allow players to reach optimal research quality as well as obtain perfect fairness.
This region acts by looking at a set of corners of distance d apart. Similar to the square this takes O(d) steps. These corners provide a smaller amount of computation that needs to be done by the robot, but because it only looks at 4 separate nodes, does not do as well as the 4 × 4 square region. However, in our experiments, it performed the same as the 2 × 2 square. Our states for 4 corners are:

Because of this correlation effect, fluctuations in the direction of polarization P2 are always much stronger than fluctuations in the ellipticity P3 if α is greater than 1. Indeed, the values of 2 to 6 given for α in the literature suggest a difference of almost an order of magnitude.
The number of real roots can be identified, for example, using the theory of Sturm chains. This extra calculation will likely take more computation time than the measuring of degrees required for sotd. However, both costs are usually negligible compared to the cost of lifting in the CAD algorithm.

In Table 1 I list the main features of the ELFE accelerator, and the opportunities that they provide. Compared to existing electron and muon beams, the advantages of ELFE are in luminosity (compared to the muon beams at CERN and Fermilab), in duty factor (compared to SLAC) and in energy (compared to TJNAF). Competitive ELFE experiments will rely on a combination of these strong features. The HERMES experiment at DESY works in the same energy range but at a lower luminosity and duty factor compared to ELFE. HERMES will prepare the ground for ELFE physics, together with experiments at TJNAF in the U.S., GRAAL in Grenoble and the lower energy electron facilities ELSA (Bonn) and MAMI (Mainz).

As we will see, in some particular situations the generalization to the electromagnetic field and/or more general boundary conditions will be straightforward.

HST suggests that there should be a time dependent Hamiltonian for any time-like trajectory in any Lorentzian space-time which describes the thermodynamics of a real quantum gravity system. In particular, in any causal diamond in Minkowski space there exists a sequence of uniformly accelerated trajectories that share the same past and future tips. These are lines on time-like hyperbolae of different curvature, but with different foci. In the limit as the proper time in the diamond goes to infinity, they become the trajectories studied by Unruh, which are flow lines of the vector field representing a Lorentz boost J0i. Similarly, in dS space, there are lines of fixed radius and fixed direction ni on the two sphere. Our proposal for the Hamiltonian for such trajectories in a diamond of proper time N is

What are the alternatives to the singular description of the translational motion of the D0-brane by means of open strings? In analogy to the techniques used for field theory solitons, one can introduce the translational degree of freedom for the D0-brane explicitly (as a dynamical trajectory). The (singular) initial and final state massless open strings are then absent from the physical amplitudes by construction. This is the worldline formalism that will be our primary subject in the next section. As we shall see then, the amplitudes constructed within this framework are free of infrared pathologies.

We vary the symbol size from 8 bytes to 32KB. Our evaluation operates on 30 stripes of data for different sets of (n, k). To stress test the computational encoding/decoding performance, we eliminate the impact of disk I/Os by first loading the data that is to be downloaded by the relayer for recovery into memory. We then measure the time for performing all encoding/decoding operations on the in-memory data for reconstruction. We compute the reconstruction throughput, which is defined as the size of the lost data divided by the reconstruction time.

We have presented optimized strategies to improve the efficiency of blind searches for isolated gamma-ray pulsars, whose search sensitivity is computationally limited. Under these conditions, our results confirm that fully coherent searches are generally less efficient than semicoherent searches, as well as that harmonic summing is typically less efficient than searching only for the strongest individual harmonic. We also derived the parameters for most efficient search grids. As motivated by these results, we presented and studied the implementation of a multistage search strategy. We have also presented efficient computation and interpolation techniques for the semicoherent test statistic, offering further important sensitivity gains. Finally, we have conducted realistic simulations which demonstrate the improved performance from our combined advances, providing in a substantial increase in sensitivity (i.e. lowering the minimum detectable pulsed fraction by almost 50%) over previous methods at the same computational cost.

Advocates of frequentist and Bayesian methods have unfortunately been polarized into two extreme camps, with only the most acrimonious communication between them. In fact, both methods are rather like a powerful hunting rifle. Used properly, they are efficient and successful at doing their job. Improper use may result in permanent catastrophic injury and/or death. We will briefly examine the objections to both methods, and in doing so find that the disagreements are actually objections to using the methods improperly.

The introduction of the Iodine absorption-line reference cell was crucial to the current renaissance in precision radial velocity studies and to the detection of extrasolar planets. The reference cell provides a stable zero-velocity narrow-line calibrant needed to precisely determine slight Doppler shifts over long time scales. Reference cells are still central to radial velocity studies today, although although some groups now use a Th-Ar emission lamp or a laster stabilized spectrographs instead. Conventional Doppler measurements are limited to bands where the standards have adequate transmission or dense and narrow spectral signatures.

Whether the dissipation of vortex energy contributes significantly to cluster heating will, of course, ultimately depend on the energy released by the AGN. Even if the dissipation time is short compared to the travel time and the cooling time, a sufficient amount of energy has to be injected into waves and then extracted into the vortex field, which depends on the filling factor of cavities in clusters and the on AGN energy output relative to the cooling rate.

A guiding principle underlying any effective theory aiming to describe the low-energy limit of a deeper, more fundamental theory can be formulated in the following way: The low-energy (infrared) phenomena are not sensitive enough to resolve high-energy (ultraviolet) dynamics. It means that short-range (high-momentum) dynamics can be removed from the theory and replaced (renormalized) by a few local corrections. In momentum space one can therefore expand a short-range (SR) interaction as:
Finally, since θy ≥ 0 for all y, we have
Tail Inequalities
The Yakindu models may include state and transition actions. Since UPPAAL only supports transition actions, we also translated any necessary state action to a transition action. In Yakindu, the state actions include entry, exit and timer based actions. The entry action should be performed once when entering the state. We translated this to an action assigned to all the incoming transitions to the corresponding state. The exit action, which must be executed when existing the state, was translated to actions on all the outgoing transitions. For the timer-based state actions, we created a self-transition and used the timer as transition guard.

A large number of matter fields are predicted to exist in unified field theories such as string theory.

The conditional tensor factorization facilitates borrowing of information across different profiles in a flexible representation of the unknown density. We focus our attention on situations involving continuous responses and categorical features.

Notice that for each pair (α, β), at least one type of uni-directional coupling can change the attractor enough to make D1 = DL. As a result, we conjecture that in the case of bi-directional coupling, D1 = DL for prevalent f and g.

Here, we present the first design and implementation of a microfabricated trap to perform individual addressing for optical transitions using a magnetic field gradient. Addressability is demonstrated by observing distinct peaks in the frequency spectrum, and by performing Rabi oscillations on one of two trapped ions with a low probability of unwanted excitation on the neighbouring ion. Integrating the gradient-generating wires with microfabricated traps assures position stability. We evaluate this individual addressing scheme to show that we can achieve reasonable gate speeds, and minimal crosstalk between neighbouring ions, with no decrease in coherence time measured with spin-echo. Finally we consider its prospects for scaling to many ions.
For a perfect fluid at rest, e.g. a homogeneous scalar field, the Einstein equations can be written as
Panels (d), (e) and (f) show results for stronger helicity injection (η0 = 1) at which the helicity is becoming active. Depending on α, the energy accumulates in certain shells at large scales, i.e. in only four shells (panel d) or in all shells with kn < 100 (panel f). In these ranges, the relative helicity tends to unity, which can be distinguished since H(k)/k (open circles) approaches E(k) (closed circles).
From these observations, we find that there is a real sense in which the topological winding of the ground state is still encoded in the disordered system. Even though the disorder induces scattering and tends to randomize the internal configuration of the single-particle states, the correlation between momentum and internal degree of freedom persists throughout the topological state. This manifests itself consistently as a spectral flow of orbital entanglement modes as a function of the momentum entanglement cut. The topological phase transition toward the trivial state eventually occurs when the scattering is strong enough that entanglement modes saturate 1/2, which we have identified throughout this work as leading to the trivial Anderson insulator. It would be interesting to see how these results can be applied to higher-dimensional topological systems. In higher dimensions the scattering kinematics are much less constrained and it is not clear how well the topological information would be encoded in the momentum entanglement. However, here we see that we can capture the correlations between the momentum and the internal degrees of freedom which is a fundamental feature of free-fermion topological phases, so perhaps this tool will still be useful. It may also be useful to consider this type of hybrid cut for numerically identifying 1D interacting topological phases of fermions or even in spin-systems.

The requirement of having a finite automorphism group means that any component whose normalization is rational must contain at least 3 singular points. If a curve meets the other requirements but has components with rational normalization containing 2 singular points, then it is semipseudostable. In addition to the chains of rational curves that Deligne-Mumford semistability permits, rational cuspidal tails (rational cuspidal curves meeting the rest of the curve in a single point) are semipseudostable.

For an interpretation of these results it is important to distinguish between the spectroscopic and intrinsic quadrupole moment of a particle. It is known that a vanishing spectroscopic quadrupole moment does not necessarily imply a spherically symmetric charge distribution. For deformed spin 0 and spin 1/2 nuclei this has led to the general concept of an intrinsic quadrupole moment, which can be defined for different nuclear models. The notion of an intrinsic quadrupole moment allows to interpret measurable quantities such as transition quadrupole moments in terms of the geometric shape of the ground state.

One way is like the following: To apply the Seiberg-Witten map associated with the noncommutativity in the rectangular coordinates we first transform the commutative solution obtained in the polar coordinates into the one in the rectangular coordinates. Then after getting noncommutative solutions by applying the Seiberg-Witten map with the canonical commutation relation of the rectangular coordinates, we rewrite them back into the polar coordinates. The other way is to use the Seiberg-Witten map directly in the polar coordinates without rewriting the solution back and forth between the polar and the rectangular coordinate systems.

In this section we review the S-matrices for scattering among the kinks and elementary (Majorana) fermions. From these we derive S-matrices for scattering between Dirac fermions, kinks and Dirac fermions, and rank 2 bound states and Dirac fermions. Knowledge of these S-matrices will allow us to compute the various form factors needed to obtain the results in the previous section. Before beginning it is necessary to lay out the group theory of SO(8). In particular it is necessary to describe the spinor representations (i.e. the kinks) of SO(8).

In this paper we set out to study a simpler model which can be expected to capture some essential aspects of P (and T) violation in macroscopic magnitudes. Specifically, the model we analyze consists of a gas of charged particles moving through a dilute random array of flux tubes. We shall work with a pure AB interaction, not imposing ab initio an asymmetry in the scattering cross-sections. We shall explicitly compute the electrical (dc) conductivity of the system, expecting to find a spontaneous Hall effect. From the viewpoint of mean field theory the graininess of the array should be unimportant. In this case one would expect to find a transverse conductivity similar to that of the Quantum Hall effect.

The paper is organized as follows. The QCD sum rules of three-point correlators are considered in Section 2, where the spectral densities are calculated in the bare quark-loop approximation and with account of the Coulomb corrections, and the gluon condensate term in the Borel transform scheme is presented. Numerical estimates of semileptonic decay modes are also given here. Section 3 is devoted to the NRQCD sum rules for recoil close to zero. The spin symmetry relations are derived and the gluon condensate is taken into account in the scheme of moments. The results are summarized in Section 4. Appendices A and B contain technical details in evaluation of decay widths for the massive leptons and gluon condensate in full QCD, respectively.

The solid curve corresponds to dust-free, undepleted nebulosity, while the other curves show the results of introducing depletion, dust opacity, and grain heating + cooling. In almost all cases, the effects of dust lead to an enhancement of optical forbidden-line emission over the undepleted, dust-free case, due to an increase in equilibrium Te.

Differential Zeeman shifts arise from the inhomogeneous magnetic field of the trap.

This means that electrons that suffer losses will immediately be dragged on by the electric field that builds up in such a way that just an electrostatic wave is produced.

The parameter α, which is proportional to the volume density of infalling material, becomes the key parameter to be constrained by the data. Its spatial variation α(R, z) is not known. However, experimenting with different patterns we found that the results are not qualitatively very different as long as its value does not vary too steeply in the inner halo. We therefore take α to be constant, which implies that in a given interval δt a cloud captures the same amount of infalling gas regardless of its location. We exclude regions very close to the disc, |z| < 0.2 kpc.

In this paper we have presented a detailed Bayesian error analysis based on binary-hypothesis testing (BHT) to derive expressions for the minimum combined source strength needed to superresolve a pair of closely spaced point sources located in the plane of best focus from their image formed under a Gaussian PSF approximation. The statistical metric we have used here to determine this minimum value of the source strength needed for pair OSR is the minimum probability of error (MPE) on a successful BHT protocol. Specifically, we considered the pair to be resolved if the MPE for the associated BHT problem falls below a small threshold value, taken here to be 0.05. Our calculations are done for a variety of operating conditions characterized by arbitrary values of the source signal strength, background photon count, and sensor noise variance.

In § 3, we the present astrometric curves and the corresponding light curves of example binary-source events to illustrate the relative difficulty in describing the astrometric lensing behaviors by the blending approximation alone. In § 4, we statistically estimate the range of the binary source separation and the companion light fraction where the blending approximation breaks down for the description of the photometric and astrometric lensing behaviors. We conclude with § 5.

The result of the above-mentioned changes in the code is that substantially larger fraction of binaries than computed before passes trough the stage of stationary mass exchange instead of forming common envelopes and the number of systems with subgiant donors increases by about an order of magnitude compared to the number obtained in Yungelsonan et al., (1996). In symbiotic binaries, the number of WD with stationary burning increases by a factor ≃2.5.

Since the CLAS has very good acceptance for charged particles, and a very limited one for neutrals, the analysis of the γd → π0d reaction was based on detecting the final-state deuterons and selecting the good events by the missing-mass technique. Deuterons were identified from their time of flight and momentum, which allowed a mass reconstruction. Thus, the initial event selection was done based on the reconstructed mass. Further selection of events was achieved by comparing the event vertex time with the photon vertex time as measured by the tagger. Low-momentum protons were discarded based on a cut on the particle momentum vs. energy loss in the TOF. In addition, fiducial cuts were applied to the remaining data sample in order to remove edge areas of the detector where the acceptance was not well reproduced by a simulation.

The basic form of our analysis for ordinary least squares also generalizes to give an analysis of the ridge estimator, which is applicable in infinite-dimensional covariate spaces. This analysis, which we specialize to the case where β perfectly models the Bayes predictor, is somewhat more involved because establishing the accuracy of the empirical second-moment matrix is more delicate. Nevertheless, its core still rests upon the same (or similar) exponential tail inequalities used in the analysis of ordinary least squares.

The smallest cluster for which a low temperature peak is present in the heat capacity is LJ31, where the energy landscape chart shows that immediately above the peak (which is at T ≈ 0.02) a handful of very similar states, distinct from the global minimum, dominate. At much higher temperature, T = 0.1, at the separation point of the basin containing the global minimum, the system transitions between many distinct configurations, which is confirmed by MD simulations.

We masked three fibres located at the edges of the CCD chip during data reduction, in order to remove fibres not completely on the chip. These fibres are all located at the edges of our FOV, and so removing them does not have a big impact on our data.

The parity operation is slightly subtle for neutral particle spinors.
A crucial note is due. The edge spin polarization in ballistic systems appears not as a result of electric field-driven acceleration of electrons and associated with it precession of spins. Indeed, electric field in a ballistic system is absent as the electric potential drop occurs over a contact region with the leads rather than over a bulk of a ballistic conductor. Nevertheless, spin precession does occur. It originates from accelerated electron motion in the boundary potential that provides lateral confinement. Bias applied to the contacts ensures that populations of left- and right-moving states are different and the net spin precession appears. Naturally, it is proportional to the applied bias V. The net spin accumulation near an edge of a 2DEG is independent of the shape of the boundary potential,

When the island oscillates, the gate capacitance changes with the position of the island center z, and therefore the transport properties of the SET change.

To estimate the axion decay constant around the special points, it is required to derive an exact form of period vector and its monodromy transformation. In the remaining of this paper, we show the systematic approach to find the general expression of period vector and its monodromy transformation for one-parameter CY manifold within the framework of topological string, in which these period vectors are governed by the Picard-Fuchs differential equations. It thus allows us to study the axion decay constant around the special points of moduli space.

Conclusion
In this article, we describe the mathematical structure underlying the integrable quantum pairing problem, and its relations with the theory of isomonodromic deformations of differential equations and other integrable models of strongly interacting particles. We also explain the classical limit of the quantum hamiltonian, and give the explicit construction of the solution in this case. Possible applications due to the integrability of the model are listed in the conclusion of the article.

We have proposed a novel method for the identification of nonlinear systems. This method is based on a lifting technique which recasts nonlinear system identification as the identification of the linear Koopman operator in an infinite-dimensional space of observables. A key advantage of the method is that it relies only on linear techniques. Also, it is robust to noise, well-suited to model low sampling rate data sets, and efficient to recover the vector field of different classes of systems.

Introduction
The method of the epicyclic approximation (Lindblad 1927, 1959) allows the orbits of stars to be constructed in a coordinate system rotating around the Galactic center in a circular orbit. We assume that the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the local standard of rest and that the stars move along epicycles in the direction opposite to the Galactic rotation. We use the method in a form associated with a rectangular coordinate system (Fuchs et al. 2006):

The experimental results discussed here for single cells tell us that it is important to consider a large range of the parameter ν = κa: ν can range over at least two orders of magnitude (0.001 < ν < 0.1) for yeast, gram-positive, and gram-negative bacteria. Thus, neither perfectly reflecting nor perfectly absorbing boundary conditions are relevant for nutrient uptake in many cell populations. Instead, we develop a theory for the nutrient absorption by a cluster of cells with arbitrary ν. This is the subject of the next section.

We also find that simple energy-based similarity scaling laws reasonably describe the asymptotic time evolution of jet length and cocoon size in our simulations, independent of our model parameters. This lends further support to the employment of these simple relations in estimating radio lobe energy densities and estimating flow properties. Although some observed structures may depend upon the unique history of a particular object, our simulations suggest that very basic size parameters are well-described by simple scaling laws.

Different approaches to the fermion mass problem are reviewed. We illustrate these approaches by summarizing recent developments in models of quark and lepton mass matrices. Dynamical calculations of the top quark mass are discussed, based on (a) infrared quasi-fixed points of the renormalisation group equations, and (b) the multiple point criticality principle in the pure Standard Model. We also consider Yukawa unification and mass matrix texture. Models with approximately conserved gauged chiral flavour charges beyond the Standard Model are shown to naturally give a fermion mass hierarchy.
For the nematic phase the relation is found to be
Adding the four results does not yield the desired answer, since the contribution of each of the two axes has been included twice, and that of the origin altogether four times. This can be easily corrected by subtracting F2(λ2, λ3; S) which removes the extra contribution of the j1 = 0 axis, and F2(λ1, λ3; S) which does the same thing with the j2 = 0 terms. This leaves us with the origin (j1 = j2 = 0) which, at this point, is still contributing double its value (two contributions have been removed with the two axes); subtracting λS3 fixes that as well.

The remaining sources are most likely associated with EROs in their error circles. In particular, the brightest A2390 submillimeter source is associated with a very luminous ERO, which is also a weak ISOCAM source (Lemonon et al. 1999). We do not know of a spectroscopic identification for this source. The weakest of the three 4σ A2390 sources lies near a bright spectroscopically confirmed cluster member. It appears unlikely this is the correct identification of the source, which may be associated with one of the fainter galaxies in this area. The effects of excluding this source from our subsequent analysis are small.

Engineering strong p-wave interactions between fermions is one of the challenges in modern quantum physics. Such interactions are responsible for a plethora of fascinating quantum phenomena such as topological quantum liquids and exotic superconductors. In this letter we propose to combine recent developments of nanoplasmonics with the progress in realizing laser-induced gauge fields. Nanoplasmonics allows for strong confinement leading to a geometric resonance in the atom-atom scattering. In combination with the laser-coupling of the atomic states, this is shown to result in the desired interaction. We illustrate how this scheme can be used for the stabilization of strongly correlated fractional quantum Hall states in ultracold fermionic gases.

Similarly, we also calculate the decoherence power for a qubit of the depolarizing channel $d, the phase-damping channel $p, the amplitude-damping channel $a and the generalized amplitude-damping channel $g. Based on the analogous calculation to those in Eqs. (27-30), we have

It is interesting to analyze the scattering of fermions at the Kondo boundary. We send in a left moving fermion and we try to find out what the outgoing excitations are. This scattering amplitude is related to the correlation function of a left moving with a right moving fermion which is constrained by conformal invariance to be of the form

We have developed two robust and accurate algorithms to detect non-overlapping maximal spheres in halo or galaxy samples. We have applied them to several numerical simulations boxes in order to study the performance of the algorithms. The results found were very satisfactory.

Single-component models do not provide an adequate description of the spectrum of AXJ2254+1146. A single temperature Raymond-Smith model or a single power-law model are both rejected at a high confidence level (≥ 99.999%).
Substitution of (38) into (33),(34) gives the outgoing waveform at asymptotically large radii. The transverse traceless amplitudes (to linear order) are then simply:
ArgoNeuT proposed also to study a subsample of two proton events by demanding that both protons have momenta larger than argon Fermi momentum. In this way, they received a reduced sample of only 19 events. In NuWro simulations, the similar requirement reduces the number of events by a factor of 30%, in very good agreement with 11/30 in the ArgoNeuT study.
This last property puts a constraint on the constructions of linear operators. For operators
Because our ansatz is explicitly time-independent, the Lorentzian and Euclidean solutions are trivially related.
The treatment of the entire basis set within one single energy panel allows all states, including the semi-core states, to hybridize fully with each other. Our method is linear, i.e., the basis functions are constructed by expanding around fixed energies Eν. The expressions for the crystal wave functions in the muffin-tin spheres are matched to the interstitial crystal wave function at the sphere boundaries so that the total crystal wave function becomes continuous and differentiable in all space. In the present calculation, the expansion in spherical harmonics was taken up to l = 6. For Ce, the 6s, 5p, 6p, 5d, and 4f orbitals were included in the basis set, with 5p as semicore. For Fe, we included the 4s, 4p and 3d orbitals, i.e., no semi-core state was used for Fe. Four κ2-values were used in the calculation: -0.6 Ry and -0.1 Ry for the valence states, and -1.5 Ry and -1.0 Ry for the semi-core Ce 5p states, all with respect to the muffin-tin zero.
The maximum of R on the eastern side is therefore reached for z = z3.

First, let us write down the 10ΛLi wave function as
The main reason why the BRST invariance in the CGHS model is intact is that the Kato-Ogawa anomaly term (34) (that corresponds to the central extension of the Virasoro algebra) is BRST trivial. That is, this term can be canceled by adding to the action a local counterterm of the form

Let us first consider a system with only two states, A and B. Unless there is at least one transition (say, from A to B), the system is trivial and does not evolve at all. However, with only A → B the steady state of the system is ρ(A) = 0 and the generalized entropy φ is not well defined. We therefore need consider only systems that include both transitions, A → B and B → A. Such systems, however, have an equilibrium state that obeys detailed balance, and therefore the Crooks relation is satisfied for all (relevant) two-state systems.
6. At high energy densities a deviation of the UrQMD equilibrium state from SM results is found. It is connected with a specific behaviour of string degrees of freedom in the UrQMD model. This energy density region lies close (or even above) to the expected phase transition boundary of the quark-gluon plasma state. The study of this energy density region deserves further efforts.
In Sect. VI we estimate persistent currents in the rings made of real band insulators (GaAs, Ge, InAs) with a fully filled valence band and empty conduction band. The current at full filling decays with the ring length exponentially due to the exponential decay of the Wannier function tails. In spite of that, it can be of measurable size.
Two effects should be considered here. First, if most PNs are formed from more massive than the Sun stars, which on average are more metal rich, then the percentage of progenitors interacting with planet increases. Second, as note by Soker (2001b), most known Sun-like stars that have planets around them will not form PNs at all. Their planet(s) will deposit enough orbital angular momentum and energy to cause most, or even all, of the envelope of these stars to be lost already on the red giant branch. These stars will not evolve along the AGB, or evolved only along the early AGB. In any case, they will have too low mass envelope to form a detectable PN. This reduces the fraction of PN progenitors interacting with planets.

In this letter we reconsider the problem of CP violation in supersymmetric extensions of the standard Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model (SM) of the electroweak interactions. In particular, we want to address the question of whether the presence of a CP violating phase (δKM) in the Yukawa sector of the supersymmetric theory may induce, through the running of the relevant parameters from the GUT scale to the Fermi scale, CP violation in the soft breaking sector.
The next non-vanishing term corresponds to the perturbation of the potential energy of the system,
demonstrating the dominance of the helicity-2 process, as predicted by theory.
Being that the analyzed events are mainly peripheral with small contaminations from the mid-rapidity source and well detected from the point of view of the size of the QP and the linear momentum, the excitation energy has been calculated via calorimetry. Possible contributions of nonthermal origin to the excitation energy have been evaluated by comparing the measured kinetic energies to thermal predictions. Indeed some pre-equilibrium light particles or fragments could have been included in the reconstructed Quasi-Projectile and contributed to its excitation energy.

But how to extract physically meaningful signals? In order to better understand the technical details of signal extraction, we explain first, how magnetic power spectra could be extracted from Faraday rotation maps. Then we show that higher-order statistical properties of the magnetic turbulence may be measurable from Planck synchrotron-polarization data.
By substitution of the obtained values of the coupling constants into the action in eq. (4.39), we come to the new conformal theory described by the following perturbative action

We briefly summarize theoretical methods for carrying out QCD calculations to next-to-leading order in perturbation theory. In particular, we describe a new general algorithm that can be used for computing arbitrary jet cross sections in arbitrary processes and can be straightforwardly implemented in general-purpose Monte Carlo programs.
One may perhaps object that the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy produced by the growth of a black hole is not actually produced (or at least not made accessible) until the black holes decay by way of Hawking radiation. The larger the mass of the black hole, the longer this takes, and certainly for the black holes at the centers of galaxies this time scale is considerably longer than the age of the universe. This claim would seem to fly in the face of the usual connection between black-hole area and entropy required by the second law of thermodynamics. Nonetheless, even that will not prevent black holes from being the primary source of entropy in the universe.
Homology and Cohomology
The analysis differs from previous point source searches most drastically in two points.
The central idea underpinning our dynamical approach is the following: Considering a diffusion process on a network, we ask ourselves what this simplest form of dynamics can reveal about the underlying community structure of the graph. This idea is readily illustrated by the example of a vessel filled with water in which one were to put a small droplet of ink and observe how it diffuses. If the container has no structure, the dye would diffuse isotropically. If the container is structured (e.g., compartmentalised or comprising a set of smaller vessels connected via some tubing), the dye would not spread isotropically but would rather get transiently trapped in certain regions for longer times until it eventually becomes evenly distributed throughout the whole vessel. Therefore by observing the time dynamics of this diffusion process we can gain valuable information about the structural organisation of the container.

where the density k(x, y) of sensors follows a uniform distribution in the occupied area by each cluster that is approximately 4a2/k. Each non-CH node only needs to transmit its data to the CH once during a frame. Presumably the distance to the CH is small, so the energy consumption follows the Friss free-space model (d2 power loss). Thus the expected distance between a sensor and a CH in a cluster decreases as increasing of number of sensors in a bounded region.
The induced field strength is then

The binary operations that appear in these latter equations are very interesting objects, and in some sense can be interpreted as a natural generalization of the usual Poisson Bracket. The standard Poisson Bracket operates over functions defined in the same space, the phase space of coordinates qi, pi. Nevertheless, the binary operators in equations (29) and (30) are connecting functions that live in different spaces. In general, if we have two functions f(xi, yi), g(zi, wi) that take values in different spaces characterized by the coordinates: xi, yi and zi, wi, it will be possible to define a Generalized Poisson Bracket that mixes the functions and their variables

Moreover, the resolvent of A is compact in the energy space H.
Now we show that non-elementary subgroups have finite centralizers. Indeed, if the centralizer CG(H) of H in G contains an infinite order element c, then H fixes the limit set of the cyclic subgroup generated by c, so H cannot be non-elementary. Thus CG(H) must be a torsion group, in particular, CG(H) is elementary, else CG(H) would have to contain a non-abelian free subgroup. If CG(H) is infinite, it has a nonempty limit set that must be fixed by H, contradicting the assumption that H is non-elementary.
In the present paper, matrix elements of a two-body interaction between states of jn configurations were considered. The two-body interaction is taken to be a perturbation and hence, only the sub-matrix of the Hamiltonian, defined by states of the jn configuration, is considered. The matrix elements are functions of two-body energies V(J) = <j2JM | V | j2JM >. There are states whose expectation values (diagonal matrix elements) are linear combinations of the V(J) with positive rational coefficients. In this paper, it was shown that this is always the case for states which are the only ones with given J in the jn configuration considered. Such states are eigenstates of the sub-matrix considered.

We first deal with the problem of extracting hubs and functional modules. Most previous approaches have looked at the problem of detecting functional modules separately from that of hub proteins. However, hub proteins form the key constituents of most functional modules. In any functional module, the hub proteins not only hold the other proteins within that module together, but also determine the most dominant functions of that module. Also, protein networks are usually very sparse with several singleton(isolated) and loosely-connected proteins. Such proteins may be connected to one or more hub or non-hub proteins, but generally do not take part in any functional module. Taking such proteins into consideration induces false positives, thereby affecting the specificity of the results. As a result of these observations, we approach the whole problem in the following three steps:

A second class of states is given by those which are asymptotically τ-stationary in the eternal frame, but distinct from the trivial CFT vacuum on dS. The natural way of engineering such states is to deform the CFT by a relevant operator and consider stationary states looking like condensates induced by the new relevant interactions. These states, while completely regular in the eternal dS frame, are singular in the E-frame and therefore called crunch states.

Specifically, in §2 we discuss the retrieval of the Spitzer data used in our study and their photometry. General description of the mid-infrared characteristics of the region is given in §3, and in §4 the point sources detected with our photometry, and the selection of candidate YSOs are presented. The recent release of high-resolution data on NGC 602/N90 obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on Hubble Space Telescope allowed us a detailed photometric study of the stellar association and its surroundings down to the faint red pre-main sequence stars of the system (Schmalzl et al. 2007). In §4 we also combine the results from both Hubble and Spitzer photometries to identify the optical counterparts of the candidate YSOs found in the region. Based on our findings we discuss the current star forming process that probably took place in the region of NGC 602/N90 with emphasis to the clustered behavior of star formation in §5. Finally, general conclusions of this study are given in §6.

More interestingly, we note that the thermal mass correction coincides exactly with that obtained in a conventional thermal (scalar) field theory in four dimensions.

What is not clear is when CUTP(G) = HYPP(G) and whether there is a nice characterization of such hypermetrics. Above discussion is applied also to cones.

We have computed the derivatives of the overlap Binder cumulant in the range from g = 0.6 to g = 0.8 (the crossing point is close to the value 0.75). In this interval we have fitted the Binder cumulant curves (at fixed L) using fourth and fifth order polynomials (in order to control the systematic effects due to the fitting procedure). To cross check consistency we have also used a derivative both with respect to the temperature and with respect to β: the two procedures are equivalent and they should produce the same result.

We find that our results are qualitatively in accordance with numerical simulations indicating that if vortices are forced to oscillate with amplitudes larger than the typical VL parameter, plastic motion introduces topological defects and reduces mobility. For smaller drives, vortices perform small excursions interacting repeatedly with neighbors and as the lattice becomes successively more ordered, its mobility increases.

The second run of the LHC is now ongoing and new data will soon allow us to shed more light on the physics living at the TeV scale.

To express the average properties of intensity and flow fields around pores in more quantitative terms, we compute for each instance azimuthal averages of intensity, velocity, divergence, and radial component of velocity. Pores come in a variety of shapes so that computing meaningful azimuthal averages becomes a challenging task. In the following, we describe two different approaches to compute azimuthal averages based on single and time-averaged G-band images.
Thus, we have a very clear one to one map between giant graviton configurations and vacua of the auxiliary gauge theory on the D0 branes. The map is naively three to one, but we have seen that the configuration with no polarization (dual to the KK graviton) is excluded, and the two configurations dual to the same gauge theory vacuum have non-overlapping ranges of validity.

Both lines are expected to be present in a Compton reflected spectrum (see e.g the theoretical reflected X-ray spectrum presented in Reynolds et al., 1994).

2. Shower Finding: Taking candidate tracks as input, an EM shower finding algorithm is used to identify the muons with possible EM shower dE/dx information. Muons deposit energy as a minimum ionization particle (MIP) in the detector cells. The additional EM shower hits can deposit much more energy in a small detector region and overlaps with muon energy. It is then possible to take the energy deposition of reconstructed cosmic tracks and look for the region where the energy is significantly greater than a MIP. More specifically, If we find 5 consecutive planes with energy greater than 2 MIP, call it the shower start point; If we find 5 consecutive plane with energy in the range of 0.5 MIP to 1.5 MIP, call it the shower end point; If we find both the shower start and end point, then the shower is identified as Brem; If we find only the shower start point, and reach the end of track without an end point, the shower is identified as an electron from DiF. Showers with energy deposition passing the energy cut are saved as raw digit objects.

as a function of the threshold ρ. A(0) and M(0) both equal the size of the set of genes, as the whole set is connected before any thresholding procedure is applied. At large thresholds every single singe is disconnected from the other genes, as having co-expression equal to one is equivalent to having exactly the same expression across the whole brain. So at threshold 1 all the connected components have size one, and A(1) = M(1) = 1.

Finally, it is worth remarking that the analytical prescriptions presented in this work could be usefully employed in synthetic evolution models to improve them in accuracy, and to test the effects of different physical conditions, i.e. dominant nuclear reaction rates, opacity source, relative contributions of gas/radiation to the total pressure, and chemical composition.

The size of the steps describing the background contributions varies by a factor 2 in these five examples. However, due to different geometries of the detectors an interpretation of this factor is not meaningful, even more not important as in general this background is small, namely on the %-level.
If one processes the rest of the simulation on the GPU as well, the picture gets somewhat better. Most of the other parts of the simulation are bandwidth bound, i.e. typical speed-ups are around 5. Taking the same numbers as before yields an overall speed-up of 15.4 and 13.8, respectively. So if parts of the code that are less optimal for the GPU are also ported, not only will single node performance be better, but the code should also scale much better. While the above numbers are somewhat arbitrary, they illustrate the general trend.
For notation simplicity, in the sequel we use d to denote the DoF per user as well as the number of data streams able to be supported for each user by omitting M, N.

The general architecture of a C-RAN consists of three components, namely (i) a BBU pool consisting of a large number of BBUs with centralized processors, (ii) RRHs with antennas located at remote sites, and (iii) a fronthaul network that connects RRHs to BBUs with high capacity and low time latency.
In genus zero, we can make this much more explicit. Moreover, because the integration measure is known in genus zero, we can give a complete proof of parity invariance of the tree level scattering amplitudes, by showing that after the manipulation explained in section 2, the integration measure as well as the integration region becomes left-right symmetric.

It therefore appears that incorporating fermions on the 3-brane will require deriving the vierbein induced from the bulk d-bein and the 3-brane embedding. Indeed this is generally the case, and, as will be seen below, the result is considerably more complicated than for the induced metric, eq. (5). However, before embarking on this exercise it is enlightening to see why we cannot generally get away with a simpler approach.

Unfortunately, this approach does very poorly in the low-statistics realm. We consider a simple test case: Suppose our data is sampled from a flat distribution with a mean of 1 count in each of 100 bins. We test how well our estimated null hypothesis works for any given test statistic, T, as follows:
where Ap refers to the alternated group.
We have also looked at whether the future measurements of lepton number violation and non-unitarity of neutrino flavor mixing at low energies are possible to shed light on the masses of heavy Majorana neutrinos. Taking the minimal type-I seesaw scenario for example, we have illustrated the possibility of determining or constraining two heavy Majorana neutrino masses by using more accurate low-energy data on the 0νββ decay and non-unitary neutrino mixing and CP violation. Such an analysis can simply be extended to the more general cases of the type-I seesaw mechanism with three or more heavy Majorana neutrinos.

Introduction
The Hubble flow model applied to V723 Cas in Paper I is used as the basis for the first run of the axisymmetric radiative transfer code. The values of mass and inner and outer ejection velocity returned by the best fit routine are used to define the density and the shell geometry for this model. The inner and outer shell boundaries, and consequently the shell density, are time dependent and emission maps are created with epochs corresponding to the 6 cm MERLIN observations presented in Paper I.
Brownian excursions and critical quantum random graph
We have measured the topology (genus) of the large-scale structure in the universe as observed in the Las Campanas Redshift Survey. We have found the genus of the density fluctuations in the linear regime to be consistent with Gaussian random phase fluctuations, as predicted by Inflation. In combination with the the topology measurements of microwave background as observed by COBE, there are now two orthogonal projections of the three-dimensional linear-regime density fluctuation distribution. Both projections show the fluctuations are consistent with a Gaussian random phase distribution, within the uncertainty.
Due to the limitation of our computational power, we have not been able to compute the minimum weights of the 840 ternary cyclic codes of length 143 and dimension 72.

The Relations with Other Volume Preserving Systems
The presence of noise in the data considerably affects the status of the inverse Ising problem. As we will see later, even well-conditioned problems in the limit of perfect sampling (B → ∞) become ill-conditioned as soon as sampling is imperfect (finite B). The same statement holds for the sparsity-based criterion mentioned above: when data are generated by a sparse interaction network, the solution to the inverse Ising model is not sparse as a consequence of imperfect sampling. Only the presence of an explicit and additional regularization forces the solution to be sparse. In much the same way, the procedure we present hereafter builds a well-conditioned inverse Ising problem, which prevents overfitting of the noise. This procedure is based on the expansion of the entropy at fixed frequencies in clusters of spins, a notion closely related to the neighborhoods appearing in the localized responses.
The distance d of a nonzero linear code is the minimal Hamming weight (number of nonzero coordinates) of a nonzero vector in the code. Thus the distance of C(A, a) is at most n2.

For the precise measurements of inter-satellite distances in these orbit configurations the general relativistic effects must be investigated and their impact on observables taken into account for a given accuracy level. In this work we will focus on such orbital configurations and refer to one satellite as the reference object moving on the reference geodesic. The orbit of the second satellite will then be modeled by means of the geodesic deviation equation that describes how nearby geodesics deviate from each other due to the geometry of spacetime and given initial conditions. We will first describe the situation in standard Newtonian gravity and then turn to the full theory of GR to uncover relativistic modifications.
Note that if BSS(m) contains an extremal element, necessarily m is odd.

Note that for y > 1, the pseudo-moduli space is unstable for all X, while for y < 1 there is some neighborhood around X = 0 which is stable. The size of this neighborhood grows monotonically as y → 0.
One virtue of this observation is that it helps explain away the gap between the many hundreds or thousands of fields of a typical string compactification (especially, the ones with enough vacua to solve the c.c. problem) and the smaller number in the Standard Model, as symmetry breaking will get rid of nonabelian gauge groups and generally lift fields. But it is very different from the usual particle physics intuition.
Here, nc(m, δl) is the conditional mass function within a region with linear density fluctuation δl. Φ(>L|m, δl) is the cumulative conditional luminosity function and Φu (> L) is the unconditional one. It is worth to mention that in this equation we allow for a dependence of the conditional luminosity on the environmental density through δl. However, there is an increasing evidence favoring a conditional luminosity not depending on environment for a large range of luminosities (see Tinker et al. 2008; Tinker & Conroy 2008).

Negative values of M2, lead to orbits on the one sheeted hyperboloid, in which case the generator of the stability group is a hyperbolic, non compact operator. Thus φ(x) can be brought to the form iMτ1, no quantization is needed to ensure that t = exp(ατ1) be continuous. To every real value of M corresponds a basis element of the wave functional. The states are in one to one correspondence to the so-called principal series representations of SO(2, 1), which have no restriction on the value of the real Casimir. The orbits are classified by a fixed radius of the one sheeted hyperboloid.

The experimentally most relevant lattice is the fcc. The application of this theory to a synthetic fcc opal structure shows that the diffusion coefficient is linear with the mean free path of the carriers. This result holds up to mean free paths of the order of 15% the diameter of the spheres. The effect of the opal structure is to reduce the effective speed of the carriers. We calculate the dependence of this effective velocity with the size of the spheres.

Next generation ground-based γ-ray observatories, such as AGIS and CTA, will likely consist of an array of on the order of 100 telescopes, spread over an area potentially exceeding 1km2 on the ground. A starting point for understanding the response of such instruments is to simulate a large array of identical telescopes, with the parameters of the array covering the range that is reasonable from the point of view of cost, practicability of construction, and scientific return. This constrains the effective light collecting area of the individual telescopes to the range between 20 m2 to 200 m2, the separation between telescopes to the range of 80 m and 217 m and the pixel size in the camera to the range from 1 arcminute to 16 arcminutes.

In this article, we follow a different route based on an underlying theory and demonstrate that this scenario indeed has great potentiality in addressing the issue of acceleration of the universe in different era from a common platform. The reader may consider it as an altogether new paradigm rather than the continuation of an old idea. We derive the form of the cosmological term from this theory, which rules out any ad-hoc behavior. This eventually answers to the question of energy exchange too. The dramatic consequence of this idea is that it reflects all the characteristics of the expansion history of the universe of all era by a single entity and demonstrates a transition from inflationary phase to late accelerating phase through radiation-dominated and matter-dominated era. We also show that ΛCDM falls as a subset of this framework, which leads to further observational consequences.

In summary, we have introduced and tested a novel algorithm to simulate the stochastic dynamics of discrete variable models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Monte Carlo method involving real physical time, with no heuristic phase-space assumptions. This opens up the study of, e.g., strongly out-of-equilibrium situations for which exact numerical calculations are currently not possible.
As an immediate consequence, we have the following.

The contingency tables associated with the other models show that they are statistically equivalent regarding their accuracy. However, when only the lower energy range (below 5-7 MeV, depending on the atomic number) is considered, a statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence level (p-value of 0.034) is observed between the ECPSSR model and the ECPSSR-HS one; the latter is more accurate with respect to experimental data.

We employ the Dirac equation for the core electrons (up to and including the fourth shell) so that relativistic effects are fully accounted for. The core states are thus represented by four-component spinors. This representation is retained for the evaluation of the core-valence contribution to the exchange self-energy. (Using averaged core states that are represented in terms of non-relativistic lm spherical harmonics instead of the jmj spinors introduces an error of 4 and 7 meV in the direct band calculated with one-shot GW and QSGW, respectively.)

It may be that the most stable and accurate filter set for SN Ia cosmology could be built from a combination of glass and interference filters or possibly hybrid glass / interference filters where glass provides the low wavelength cut-on and a small number of interference filter layers profides the cut-off. The novel idea of using high pass filters with tuned cut-on points and then subtracting them post-observation to create a narrower filter may also be worth considering. However, this procedure increases the measurement error. Unless glass filters are developed in the infra-red the NIR filters need to be interference filters.
Let us summarize part of our conclusions in the following statement:

We investigated the effect of order direction, order aggressiveness and investor type on the dynamics of order flows. In each case, we found an increase of order volume followed by a slow decrease, which forms a peak around the extreme events. The volume peak of buyer initiated execution orders was found to appear earlier and higher than seller initiated executed orders around positive events, while the volume peak of seller initiated execution orders was found to lead buyer initiated execution orders in the magnitude and time around negative events. When orders are divided into four groups according to their aggressiveness, the behaviors of partially filled market orders, filled market orders and canceled orders are qualitatively the same: The volume peak of buy (sell) orders of each type appears earlier and higher than sell (buy) orders around positive (negative) events. However, the volume peak of sell (buy) limit orders shows up earlier and higher than buy (sell) orders around positive (negative) events. No qualitative difference has been observed in the volume dynamics around extreme events between individuals and institutions.

We have attempted to make this work as self contained as possible. In particular, we do not assume any results concerning free Lie algebras, which allows the theory of free Lie algebras and the partially-commutative free Lie algebras studied here to be developed in parallel. This comes at the cost of assuming certain facts about the combinatorics of words in RAAGs. We feel that this is a reasonable trade-off.
The number of charges a particle causes during its lifetime (i.e. the number of times a particle arrives at a site until it leaves the system), is exactly equal to the number of moves it makes; while the initial deposition represents a charge, but not a move, the final move (off the system) does not cause a charge.

The fields and their momenta have to satisfy these constraints at all times on any solution of the equations of motion. Thus the dynamics of the system is restricted to a subspace of the phase space, defined by vanishing of the constraints written as functions of phase space variables,

A very important uncertainty in the kind of analytic orbital integration schemes we employ in this study is the mass evolution of the LMC over time. The arguments laid out in this section are for the required infall mass of the LMC. The subsequent mass loss incurred by the LMC as it orbits about the MW will necessarily cause significant modifications in the orbits presented in the following section. A proper analysis accounting for this effect requires detailed N-body simulations that, in principle, are beyond the scope of the simple backward integration scheme presented here. Nonetheless, to validate our assumptions, we will compare the results from one of the MW+LMC mass combinations with those obtained with the corresponding fully self-consistent N-body model.

We postpone a deeper study of the time dependence of these phenomenological consequences including mixing and oscillations to a future article.
From Theorems 1 and 2, we may immediately deduce the asymptotic convergence order of QIs for polynomials.
In the trivial patterns the rotation centers of order 4 can only be in the vertices, and the rotation centers of order 2 can only be in the vertices or in the center of the edges; these are the trivial centers.
Now it is clear that the problem is whether the barrier of this transition is finite or infinite. We argue in this section that the barrier is in fact infinite and the Higgs branch remains stable.

One aim of DLA absorption line spectroscopy is to be able to measure elemental abundances. In the case of S, we are often limited to the S II lines described in this paper. These can be used to infer the S+ column density, but to get abundances we must estimate the ionization fraction ratio S+ /S.
First, note that Feynman-diagram-based calculations of the anomaly only reproduce the anomaly in de Rham cohomology, and so are not sensitive to the sorts of 2-torsion effects that are relevant here.
When these conditions hold, equivalence classes of such covers with ramification locus S are in correspondence with rank m additive subgroups of k.
In this section we introduce the main topic of investigation: trees of semi-simple algebras. We will show that the representation varieties of these qurves can be identified with those of certain universal localization of finite dimensional hereditary algebras. As such, all these varieties are rational varieties.
Finally, we searched for phase variations in the RV signal between the FEROS (SHL08) and CORALIE data, obtained with a time span of about one year. The results show that no measurable phase shift was found over more than 300 days to a precision of 1%.

In systems of width W = 1 we note that the boundary conditions are irrelevant. With hard-wall boundaries, a particle is blocked from above and below by the boundaries, and with periodic boundaries it is blocked by itself.
We also provide a simple model, based on a mapping between the DNA knot dynamics and a biased continuous time random walks, which faithfully reproduces our Brownian dynamics simulations starting from a minimal number of assumption. This approach can then be used to predict how the shape of the electrophoretic arc should depend on system parameters such as the average lattice spacing (pore size) of the gel and the contour length of DNA knots; as we shall see, the predicted trends are in agreement with existing two-dimensional electrophoresis data. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first example of a quantitative prediction of two-dimensional electrophoretic diagrams, hence we suggest that the approach we present could potentially lead to even more accurate and targeted experiments to separate topoisomers in DNA or other polymers.
As in the non interacting case, the fibre modulus is able to provide suitable description of dark energy even though it does not address the coincidence problem. The introduction of the nonminimal interaction term extends the existence of viable trajectories for cases when the field starts its evolution deep in the loop dominated part of the potential.

We explored in this paper the phase diagram of a non trivial system. The effective energy and momentum, as well as the number of dunes and the total volume of these dunes are not conserved at the scale of the whole system. The model has a peculiar phenomenology, inspired by the geophysical problem of barchan fields. In particular, dunes interact with each other through nontrivial collisions and remote volume exchange. Dunes are injected in the field, while volume loss at each one of them ensures they have a finite lifetime. Two parameters, comparing forcing and dissipation for ξ, isolated and interacting behavior for η, define the phase diagram.

While there are several protocols that enable users to privately compute the summary of their values, in many cases, as in the case of KDK, there are several hidden implementation bottlenecks which can significantly delay the calculations of different stages of the protocol. In this work we indicate that for instance the multi-round KDK protocol, due its heavy reliance on pairings is not practical at present for large numbers of users n > 100, whereas PCL is highly practical in these cases at the expense of reduced collusion tolerance. We showed that further customization of the privacy level facilitates further extensions to both protocols, and such extensions were shown to be secure. If applied, these extension can boost the efficiency of both these protocols, leading to faster applications with customizable levels of privacy.

In this paper, we study the voting systems, where voters can be grouped into parties (or interest groups) and the party members are required to follow party discipline, that is, the voters of the same party should all vote according to the party preference. In this setting, the outcome of the voting can be easily predicted, once the preferences of all parties are declared. Such voting scenarios can be found in various real-world applications, for example, parliament voting and board elections of universities.
Data were obtained for lattices of sizes L = 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 21, 24, 29, 32, 41 and 48. For each L, 500 different random sets of bonds were studied, for each of the four boundary conditions. Thus, combining the data for the different boundary conditions, we have 2000 values of E0 and S0 for each L.

The density of kinks is proportional to the eighth root of the transition rate. The asymptote is achieved for τ > >2A. The critical exponent does not depend on the actual choice of the UV cut-off provided by the function U2(k).

The ATNF expect to have a 10 Gb/s network installed at all their telescope sites by early 2005.

The new ATCA broadband backend (sited at Narrabri) is projected to be completed in 2007. It will be able to correlate the VLBI-station data, delivered over fibre, in real time. The correlator will be free as during the VLBI runs the ATCA operates as a VLBI-station itself.

The Chandra observation on Feb. 6, 2006 clearly detected V504 Cen at 0.068±0.005 cts/s, however not with a soft X-ray spectrum. Photons up to 2 keV are detected, and the data are best fit with a power law model with photon index 3.2±0.5, and foreground absorption consistent with zero (χred = 1.1). Bremsstrahlung (kT = 0.4 keV) or blackbody (kT = 0.14 keV) models fit substantially worse. We did not detect a soft X-ray spectrum 11 days after the first report of optical faintness; this time span is a lower limit since the beginning of the optical low-state is unobserved.

In contrast to the FO case, for CIPT each order n just depends on the corresponding coefficient cn1. Thus, all contributions proportional to the coefficient cn1 which in FOPT appear at all perturbative orders equal or greater to n are resummed into a single term. This is related to the fact that CIPT resums the running of the QCD coupling along the integration contour in the complex s-plane. To perform the contour integration, we have to analytically continue the strong coupling αs to the complex s-plane, but this is straightforward since the dependence of αs on s is only logarithmic and it has the same cut structure as Π(s).

For the (2,6) superlattice, the narrowing and lowering of the gap has caused the upper edge of the gap to come below the FT frequency, leaving the FT mode once again well within the bulk phonon continuum. The coupling to these bulk modes is strong enough to produce a broad FT resonance peak, as in the case of the pure (8,0) substrate.

Instead of using a single integer i to denote the line (resp. the column) of an entry in such a matrix defined by blocks, it will be more convenient to use a couple of integers (I, α), where I is the index of the block line (resp. of the block column) and α is the relative position in the Ith block line (resp. block column).

At some level, we expect the intrinsic line profiles in the various lines to all be different, due to different local conditions in the molecular gas. Higher signal-to-noise data should show such varying profiles and allow variations in the physical properties of the molecular gas to be studied. However, the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of our observations does not allow for such detailed work and we thus only consider integrated intensity ratios for the remainder of this paper.

NGC 4698 is classified Sa by Sandage & Tammann (1981) and Sab(s) by de Vaucouleurs et al. (1991, RC3). Sandage & Bedke (1994, CAG) in The Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies presented NGC 4698 in the Sa section as an example of the early-to-intermediate Sa type. They describe the galaxy as characterized by a large central E-like bulge in which there is no evidence of recent star formation or spiral structure. The spiral arms are tightly wound and become prominent only in the outer parts of the disk. They are defined primarily by the dust which forms fragmentary lanes of the multiple-armed type. NGC 4698 possesses all the characteristics of a spiral galaxy and therefore it is morphologically different from the ellipticals with polar ring, although in both cases we are facing a similar phenomenon of orthogonal geometric and kinematic decoupling (e.g. AM 2020-504 in Whitmore et al. 1990).

While the HST image shows the features on a finer scale, the bulk of the apparent structure in the most prominent absorbing regions is resolved by WIYN. Some of the features show more filamentary edges and overall structure in the HST image. There are a few instances of features that are washed out by the seeing at WIYN but are detected in the HST image. However, there are also low-contrast features at high z that are detected in the WIYN images but not the HST image. The HST image more clearly resolves into individual features some of the absorbing material that lies further along the line of sight into the galaxy. As discussed above, there still exists a tangle of overlapping features that can be picked out, but not distinguished, in the HST image.

The comparison of theoretical dependencies mass-radius, mass-temperature, mass-luminosity and measurement data became technical possible when information about main parameters of close binary stars was obtained, because it keeps the set of data about masses, radii and temperatures of stars simultaneously.

The situation is different for x = 1000 GeV with λ, k unchanged. Here the singlet component of the lightest Higgs scalar with a mass up to about 100 GeV practically vanishes so that the NMSSM Higgs mass bound becomes similar to that in the MSSM for tan β = 2 or even stronger for tan β = 10. With decreasing parameter k the possible singlet component of the lightest Higgs scalar increases, so that for k = 0.01 and tan β = 10 a 10-GeV Higgs scalar is not excluded.
In this section we evaluate the performances of our solution by simulation and compare it to state of the art protocols. We compare RTXP with a centralized real-time solution, PEDAMACS. With unreliable links, it is not possible to give hard real-time bound on the end-to-end delay. Indeed it is not possible to give with certainty the number of retransmissions needed for a packet to be correctly received. We thus compare RTXP with a nondeterministic solution, to show that deterministic solutions are more reliable.

So far, the measurements are limited by statistical precision. The data taken in 2005 are in the final stages of analysis and will provide a significant reduction of statistical errors due to higher polarization and an order of magnitude increase in sampled luminosity. Further improvement is expected with increasing integrated luminosity and improved polarization in future runs.
In order to be accurate, we are obliged to take care of a few technicalities first.

Our goal here is to motivate the length scale based approach to effective field theories used in this paper. In this approach, a length parameter enters as a regularizing parameter in the heat-kernel method of regularization. Because this approach is less intuitive than an approach based on energy scales, we first explain the latter and then see how it adapts to a length scale formulation.

For QL = 1, the second index vanishes, so there is no contradiction with the spectrum we have found.
Note that for the mass eigenvalue expressions, Eq.(6), we have chosen to display the principal terms from each entry to the matrix, not just the possible overall leading order terms. For instance, x2/a cannot be a overall leading order term for the middle eigenvalue as the same term contributes to the smallest eigenvalue.
We now proceed to discuss the expectations of the free-CF theory on the activation gap and subsequently present our experimental measurements with the relative theoretical analysis.

Without loss of generality we can assume that Φ(G) = 1. First we shall show that every proper subgroup A of H is abelian. Let C = CG(F(G)). Then C ≤ F(G) since G is soluble. On the other hand, Claim (4) implies that F(G) ≤ D, so C ≤ D. It follows that F(DA) = F(G), so AF(G)/F(G)≃A is abelian since DA is supersoluble by Claim (2). Therefore, if H is not abelian, then H is a Miller-Moreno group.
The main contribution of the paper thus lies in investigating how the forecasts of volatility vary with different realized measures and mainly testing the time-frequency realized measures in forecasting. We show that the most important information influencing the future volatility is carried by the high frequency part of the spectra representing very short investment horizons of 10 minutes. This decomposition gives us an interesting insight into the volatility process. Moreover, we utilize jumps estimated by the JWTSRV estimator to build a Realized Jump-GARCH model, which outperforms significantly other models based on different realized measures.
The annealed approximation, introduced by Derrida and Pomeau, has revealed to be a good tool for the computation of the closing probabilities and the approximate solution of the model.
This should be valid throughout the regime in which the shell is moving relativistically, roughly corresponding to ν from the infrared to X-rays.

Next, a potential user of the routing algorithm must be able to register and unregister a callback for message reception. At last, there is the method for sending messages to other nodes in the network. The Routing Concepts specializes the Radio Concept, so that routing algorithms can be used as virtual radio interfaces for other algorithms. The concept looks as follows:

Since simple analytic expressions are available, the determination of the initial values of various parameters is performed with high precision in case of circular orbits. The situation is different for eccentric orbits, where the initial speed of the bodies is determined iteratively by successive approximation to ensure that the orbit possesses the required eccentricity after the first half orbit in its orbital evolution. The currently implemented approximation is set to yield initial data for the eccentricity with 0.01% precision but the accuracy can be increased to any desirable value of precision.

Among the most interesting of the individual structures, particularly in the context of the disk-halo interface in galaxies, are features 10 and 11. These structures lie in the NE portion of the disk of NGC 891 and are almost certainly connected with the star-formation activity on this side of the galaxy. This region shows enhanced Hα emission, as well as several structures whose shapes are reminiscent of supershells (Rand et al. 1990; Pildis et al. 1994a). Given the known presence of Hα emission near these two features, though seemingly slightly offset, the quantities derived for these two structures should be considered more uncertain than those derived for the previously discussed features due to Hα contamination in the R-band image.

The exponentiation of a variable weight factor breaks, in general, selfconsistency of the MF approximation of the non-linear sigma model.

In summary, we propose a finite difference discretization criterion for the numerical integration of the KPZ growth equation starting from the corresponding generalized discrete Langevin equation. We show that, for any discretization scheme, exists a steady state probability density function of the discrete interface heights compatible with the continuous ones, after coarse graining. Besides, we derived the KPZ coefficients of the BD model as an example of our generalized discretization. Finally, our results can be used as a new tool for the direct numerical integration of growing continuous equations with nonlinear terms due to lateral growth like the KPZ one.

Therefore, we see that the inertial mass is not an intrinsic property of the body and has its origin in the background provided by the rest of the universe. In a more mathematical sense, it can be written as follows. Let us consider that A and B are two different locations in space. Also consider that a, b are the particles in the universe and the inertial mass of the particle a is given by mia. Now, as mi is not an intrinsic property, we can write

In summary, our measurements appear to confirm that the magnetically dissipated energy is sufficient to explain thermal and nonthermal energies in solar flares, which strongly supports the view that magnetic reconnection processes are the primary energy source of flares. The nonthermal energy, which represents the primary energy source of the thick-target model, is sufficient to explain the full amount of thermal energies in 71% of the flares, according to the novel warm-target model (Kontar et al. 2011). However, the derived nonthermal energies are highly dependent on the the assumed temperature in the warm-target plasma, for which a sound physical model should be developed (see for instance Appendix A and B), before it becomes a useful tool to estimate the low-energy cutoff of nonthermal energy spectra. Future studies of this global flare energetics project may also quantify additional forms of energies, such as the kinetic energy in CMEs, and radiated energies in soft X-rays, EUV, and white-light (bolometric luminosity).

We have succeeded in using lattice Monte-Carlo methods to extract non-perturbative physics from Born-Infeld electrodynamics, quantized using the Euclidean-time functional integral approach. The on-axis (quantum) electrostatic fields of a point charge are measured as functions of the charge e introduced as a Wilson Line. The approach of Lüscher and Weisz, which reduces these measurements from an exponential- to a polynomial-time problem, was essential for extracting these quantities.

Numerical and analytical models of disk formation in a dissipationless dark matter halo also predict, for realistic total fractions of baryonic to dark matter, that spiral disks should be far from maximal (Blumenthal et al. 1986, Barnes 1987, Flores et al. 1993, Moore 1994, NFW, Dalcanton et al. 1997, Mo, Mao, & White 1998, Navarro 1998).

Not shown is the difference in molecular abundances. Here there is a resolution dependence on the formation time scale for molecular coolants, as discussed in Paper I. However, the amount formed is always sufficient to cool the cloud enough to produce the same final outcome. The final abundances are nearly identical at each refinement level except at the lowest resolution, which is different only outside of the dense regions in the final ribbon. Aside from features that do not affect the final distribution of star-forming gas, our results are independent of resolution from lmax = 4 to lmax = 6.
(1) A new regime of matter flow forms around a rotating star. Matter falls down along the axis, but only a small fraction of the incoming matter accretes to the surface of the star. Most of the matter is expelled radially in the equatorial plane by the rotating magnetosphere of the star. A low-density torus forms in the equatorial region which rotates with velocity significantly larger than the radial velocity. Large scale vortices form above and below the equatorial plane.

Symmetry breaking and hypercharge embedding in the string model.
In the context of this feedback process, we can now examine what the observed parameters of the disk of our Galaxy imply for its formation history. The age of the disk stars in the Milky Way can be used as a diagnostic to pin down the redshift of assembly. Also, constraints can be obtained on the frequency of accretion events in our halo if the bulk of the stars in the Milky Way disk assembled at z > 1. The thick disk stars have a relaxed exponential profile and were hence probably in place quite early on. Moreover, since the relaxation time-scale for stellar systems is long compared to their typical dynamical times, these stars most probably formed in situ. Chemical evolution models of our galaxy seem to indicate that a constant star-formation rate is not a bad description (Wyse & Gilmore (1995)), implying that half the stellar mass of our Galaxy probably assembled well before z = 1.

Summarizing, the 4D description is the following: the matter on the brane describes a visible sector in which the global symmetry is broken; bulk physics describes a hidden sector formed by a hot CFT which interacts with the visible one only through gravity and higher dimension operators. Some charge is transferred from the visible to the dark sector and this charge acts as a source for the Goldstone boson, so that it becomes time-dependent.

An opinion that loses all of its followers is forever lost (unless the model involves some random noise that repopulates it). Absence of an opinion may block the migration of agents in the opinion space. For example, if there are no agents with opinion 3 and if the tolerance parameter d is equal to one, there will be no crossover between opinions 2 and 4 because such an interchange would require interaction with opinion 3 first. If d = 2 such a crossover is possible as agents with opinions 2 and 4 can directly interact.

Two-dimensional models like quantum chromodynamics in two dimensions (QCD2), are convenient frameworks to discuss these kind of phenomena since they present the basic aspects of the fundamental four dimensional theories (such as the existence of nontrivial topological sectors and chirality properties) and, furthermore, analytical results can be generally obtained.
A simple 3-parameter classification scheme was used to identify spectral features. The scheme allocates each galaxy spectrum a code number from 0 to 2 according to the strength of spectral features in each of the following three categories: early-type absorption lines (molecular features such as H, K, CN, Mg), Balmer series absorption lines (Hγ, Hδ, etc.), and nebular emission lines (OII, OIII, Hβ etc.). This is physically motivated by the typical features produced by stellar populations at progressive stages during and after star-formation. We have selected an unbiased subsample of 56 galaxies which were classified using this scheme, and then collected into six broad classes with physical motivation, as follows: Class A, strong absorption lines; Class B, weak absorption lines; Class C, weak features; Class D, strong balmer lines; Class E, strong emission lines; Class F, Strong Balmer and Emission lines. We note that these classes are not directly related to any structural morphology.

Hence the supremum cannot be taken on the interior. We conclude that at least some h2i + 1 + h2i have to be one. There is then a minimal i for which this holds. We can convince ourselves that the process can now be repeated for the substring ending at i + 1. Repeating the argument we can fill up all the entries up to place i + 1 with the condition h2l + 1 + h2l = 1 and proceeding now upwards we end up with
A further complication is that the observed spectra are a convolution of several hot spots seen with different projected velocities. In addition, the number of spots is increasing. In these respects our observations have similar limitations as the Chandra X-rays observations, although our spectral resolution is much better. Spatially resolved spectroscopy would be of obvious importance.

The variable observed, invariant in v2 is defined as a subset of the memory accesses that have been issued. If the set issued is not empty, the event Observe chooses an issued memory access non-deterministically from the set and the action act1 adds it to the set observed. At this early stage there is no notion of a program. Memory accesses are issued in some arbitrary order, and once issued they can be observed repeatedly in some arbitrary order.

In this letter, we study the exchange interaction between 5d5 electrons in the t2g orbitals with large SO interaction on the basis of J-J coupling scheme as a typical model of 5d electron systems. It is shown that the FM Ising interaction (quantum compass model) occurs in the edge-shared bond due to a selection rule of hybridization between Γ7 and Γ8 orbitals. Simultaneously, an isotropic AFM Heisenberg interaction appears from the hybridization between Γ7 orbitals. These two interactions can be clearly distinguished by the second-order perturbation processes. It is also found that the FM Ising interaction becomes very small in the large SO region, which is overlooked in ref.7. As a result, we find that the interaction between 5d5 electrons changes from the FM Ising to the AFM Heisenberg interaction as SO interaction increases.

One of the most important coolants for white dwarfs during their early phases is neutrino emission. The processes that produce neutrinos in white dwarfs differ from the neutrino production associated with nuclear fusion. In a dense plasma, neutrinos can play the role that photons play in more ordinary stellar material. When photons are produced in these interactions, they quickly thermalize with the plasma because of electromagnetic scattering. But when neutrinos are produced, they are not thermalized and leave the star, taking their share of the interaction energy away with them. Thus neutrino emission is an energy sink, rather than a source.
Therefore we get

Additionally, we perform an analysis of the radial velocities of 134 clusters with properties obtained in this paper and from the literature. These clusters exhibit a wide range in properties and locations, with ages from a few Myr to 10 Gyr, Galactocentric radii under 6 kpc to outside of 20 kpc, and distances from the Galactic plane of over 2 kpc. With a sample of this size we are able to look at trends in kinematics with age and Galactic location. We especially utilize the wide range in ages to learn more about the evolution of cluster rotation.
The (y,z) plane at x=0, where the Polyakov loop jumps, is called a domain wall. This is a little confusing, because we think of a domain wall as a soliton, living subspecie aeternitatis. With only a reinterpretation of the Euclidean coordinate axes we can obtain such a picture, at the price of having either y or z axis as the infinite time axis.

Basic properties
Taking into account all the available experimental constraints/results, especially the 125 GeV SM-like Higgs boson at the LHC and the muon anomalous magnetic moment, we have studied the EWSUSY in details in the NMSSM for three scenarios. Using χ2 statistic test, we obtained the most favorable regions in the whole parameter space. Moreover, we found that the LHC SUSY searches for neutralinos/charginos and sleptons have already put considerable constraints on the electroweak SUSY sector. And then the favored model parameter space and the resulting mass spectra are modified accordingly. After the systematic analyses, we are led to the following conclusions:
The radiation-reaction force controls the rate at which orbits inspiral. This force can be expressed in terms of the rate of change of orbital elements, such as binding energy, angular momentum and the Carter constant. Since we restrict attention to an equatorial, quasi-circular EMRI geometry, we need to consider only the energy flux.
The second strategy is to plot the τ-jet events satisfying (26) as a function of

We stress our focus on minimizing search-time of the query, and the data structure that enables it, rather than detection performance which is fixed by the choice of algorithm. Choosing sample images as queries ensures that the chosen algorithm will positively detect (at least) a loop closure when one is there. However, to avoid criticalities in the evaluation, we remove the query image from the dataset, but assume that there is a true match with neighboring images or keyframes. In some cases, the neighboring keyframes may be sufficiently different to fail the test, hence introducing spurious errors in the evaluation as these should be considered loop closures. This occurs, for instance, when the dataset is severely temporally down-sampled, as in the Oxford set. However, this handicap is shared by all methods, thus making our evaluation of the relative improvement due to the adoption of our data structure, fair.

The time lags of the plume detachment and post-plume phases have been calculated as follows. We take the radially averaged temperature field at z ≈ 5δT for each snapshots in the window. If this value exceeds the mean bulk temperature it is assigned with a detachment event otherwise it belongs to the post-plume phase. By applying this simple procedure, the time series is digitalized. The resulting step function has shorter and longer time periods for both dynamical building blocks. The mean time of plume detachment and post-plume is about the same and gives about 0.45Tf for Ra = 3 × 109 where we had a sufficiently long time series. Combining both gives a typical cycle time of Tf which is consistent with the 2Tcross from the fluctuating boundary layer thickness in section 3.4.

We emphasize, however, that the edge overlap is only one interesting quantity providing information (in this case, density) about the interface.

Other quantities, in particular the energy scaling of the interface, are also required for a useful description to emerge.

We use the superfluid density to determine the phase diagram in the (T, U0) plane. ρs > 0 corresponds to the ferromagnetic or polar superfluid, and ρs = 0 corresponds to the Mott insulator phase. At finite temperature, there is a crossover from the Mott phase to the normal phase depending on the value of the compressibility.

The advantage of considering grF(R) with the above filtrations rather than grI(R) is that they are graded rings with positive depth. Unfortunately, they are not standard algebras.
When the protein dynamical transition takes place, atomic displacements begin to correlate and start covering much larger length scales. Various collective motions such as fluctuations between different macromolecular sub-states make the scene, take over and rule the internal dynamics of the protein lattice all the way to physiological temperatures. This becomes reflected in the B-factors that should now display a more rapid, maybe even exponential increase as a function of temperature.

Kinematic Cuts: because of the very different kinematics between coherent and background reactions, cuts on kinematic variables are very effective at isolating the final sample.

We note that the uncertainties calculated using lognormal realisations assume ΛCDM, and represent the variance we would expect to measure in a ΛCDM universe. It would not be possible to calculate uncertainties for a fractal universe, since a fractal has no defined cosmic variance as it has no defined mean density. However, calculating uncertainties this way gives a valid consistency check of ΛCDM.

Neither model is based on the remaining statistics. The first and most obvious thing to note is that the link-based model does extremely poorly when it comes to matching clustering while the SUGM does much better, which is natural given that the SUGM explicitly includes triangles. More interestingly, conditioning on the triangles in the SUGM is enough to deliver better matches on all of the other dimensions. For instance, the link-based model considerably underestimates the first eigenvalue (3.86 as compared to 5.54), whereas the SUGM performs better (4.68). Similarly, the link-based model underestimates the expansiveness of the networks with a spectral gap of 0.34 instead of 0.96. The SUGM again performs considerably better (0.67). These sorts of results also hold true for the average path length, fraction of nodes in the giant component, and the second eigenvalue of the stochasticized matrix.
Here, form factor uncertainties cancel at low recoil.

Macroscopic systems pose an intriguing question on the level of irreversibility. Consider a many-particle system displaying an order-disorder phase transition whose microscopic dynamics does not obey detailed balance. Does the broken detailed balance result in time-reversal symmetry breaking at the macroscopic level? On the one hand, one may expect that entropy productions of each particle add up to a macroscopic amount irrespective of a macroscopic state. On the other hand, if the system is in a disordered phase so that all configurations are almost equally likely, then irreversibility may not show up on a macroscopic level producing only a subextensive amount of entropy. A system in an ordered state has a lower entropy than in a disordered state. Then, which phase produces more total entropy including the system entropy and the environmental entropy? These questions lead us to the study of the entropy production in a model system undergoing nonequilibrium phase transition.
Galaxies analyzed in this work are all bona-fide Virgo cluster members: given the 3-D structure of the cluster, distances have been assigned following the subcluster membership criteria of Gavazzi et al.

If one of the shocked winds is at least mildly relativistic, for it to be significantly deflected the exerted lateral pressure is to be a substantial fraction of the ram pressure of the flow. Since the plasma flowing out from the system is already trans-sonic, this lateral pressure will be (Γ2 ×) higher than the thermal pressure, and the flow deflection will produce shocks. These shocks, which are stronger for higher Γ, will trigger large CD perturbations, and can be a source of energy dissipation in the form of particle acceleration.

We have seen in the previous sections that a low-energy measurement is extremely difficult because of the smallness of the QED effect and because of the large background noise, that must be suppressed to a very high degree to carry out the actual measurement, as well as because of systematic effects that must all be kept in check. However the photon-photon cross section is a fast-growing function of the photon energy, and a higher-energy measurement would be an interesting alternative approach. In this section we briefly consider the basics of photon-photon scattering, and how it relates to the underlying QED structure, and put forward some suggestions for possible experiments at a dedicated photon-photon scattering facility.

As we mentioned in the Introduction, in a Lorentz invariant theory the string tension extracted from the spacelike Wilson loop should be the same string tension that determines the strength of the linear potential between two static charges. Lorentz symmetry, however, is not maintained in a variational calculation. Moreover, the theory we are studying is defined with an explicit ultraviolet regulator that itself breaks Lorentz invariance. It is thus interesting to perform a separate calculation of the potential between external charges.

The predictive power of the chiral expansion is limited by the counterterms which must be added at each stage. The counterterms are ordered according to chiral power counting and are required as subtractions to U.V. divergent chiral loops. To overcome this drawback, a sufficient number of measured observables is needed as input. While this is possible in light mesons, it is not yet clear that it can be achieved in heavy mesons.

This can be easily shown in the case of the fourth-order crossed-box graph. In both of the field theories defined in the Introduction, this graph corresponds to an expression:
reduces to a Hamiltonian for the transverse degrees of freedom
Having identified these various scales, we note now that the thermodynamical functions at high temperature are dominated by hard degrees of freedom. The quasiparticle picture that we shall develop takes into account consistently the contributions of the hard degrees of freedom together with those of the long wavelength collective excitations. We shall comment later on the techniques based on dimensional reduction which allows a treatment of the ultrasoft contributions.
where E0 is the amplitude and kr the wavenumber.
If an initial field configuration has a finite helicity, it cannot decay further than the lowest energy state with the same helicity (again as long as reconnection may be ignored). In practice, reconnection cannot be ignored since diffusion will be important on small length scales, and rapid reconnection can happen through regions with dynamically-generated small length scales. Nevertheless, it is found that in practice helicity conservation is often a good approximation on a large scale, even when reconnection takes place on smaller scales inside the configuration.
In this section, we will review the theories of L-functions and base change. Those already familiar with them may wish to skip to the proof in the next section.
To attack this problem we must face first the issue of the - non unique - gravitational energy-momentum pseudo-tensor. We resort to three different choices, giving rise to the three different conservation frameworks described in the introduction.

The magnetisation loops measured for different directions of the applied field in the (100) plane, proved that the magnetic behaviour is not isotropic in the plane. We have chosen two symmetry directions in the (100) plane which present distinct magnetic behaviour. The first direction is along the projection in the (100) plane of the bisecting line of two Ni - Cr - Ni molecular directions, showed to be an easy axis of magnetization. The second direction perpendicular to the first one, showed to be a hard axis of magnetization. The corresponding magnetizations versus applied field curves are presented in figure 2(a, b). In the first orientation (figure 2a), the magnetization is reversed from the negative saturation value to the positive saturation value in zero field. When increasing the temperature, the saturation magnetization decreases, but the zero field slope remains constant below 0.6 K. This is confirmed by the magnetic susceptibility measured in this direction (see figure 3a).

We then use these results to identify models with certain additional structures, in analogy to the bimetric case. Focussing on the case N = 2, we first demand scale invariance of the proportional background solutions. This requirement translates into conditions on the interaction parameters which, in contrast to bimetric theory, do not lead to a unique model but leave us with a subset of free parameters. Our procedure can also be applied to general N and we use it to explicitly derive (highly symmetric) examples of models with scale invariant backgrounds.

We conjectured that we could be only one step behind M2M conversion. An M2M conversion system has two requirements. First, it must be capable of convert an arbitrary, even unseen, source to a given target. Second, it must be able to convert a source to a target that never appears in the training phase, but has limited resources during conversion. Conceptually, our framework has the ability to accommodate M2M tasks. This could be achieved by introducing a speaker recognition network (in the form of another encoder) to replace the given speaker representation (one-hot vector in our case). Or, the speaker representation could be in other forms. Once the specker representation of the unknown target speaker is obtained from the limited speech, it is likely that the decoder can blend speaker and phonetic representations to synthesize a speaker-dependent spectral frame, thus achieving M2M conversion.

For real-world QCD the condition that there should be at least 5 flavours of quarks is not a limitation, but it seems a bit strange that the bottom quark must be involved in order to define the topological susceptibility in the continuum theory. The constraint on the number of quark flavours can in fact be relaxed by introducing a multiplet of valence quarks.
In this section we introduce synthetic data examples to better understand the properties of the proposed methodology. Our goal is to demonstrate that as long as information is available, sample size increases, the mixture selection strategy proposed commonly select true correct generating distribution when there is one in the mixture family. A second synthetic data set is generated from a residual mixture model and we show that the mixture selection selects the distribution that better approximates the true mixture distribution. Finally, a thrid synthetic data includes outliers to show that the presented methodology selects a model capable of offering robust estimation to regression fixed effects.

Rather than trying to reproduce parts of that derivation, we will adopt the same approach that was used in the previous section, namely to deduce the structure of the NLL corrections through a study of the collinear limit and symmetry requirements. This will translate to determining the divergences around γ = 0 and γ = 1.

In conventional magnets with a long-range order, the local fields are static in the ordered phase. However, in CuB2O4, the local fields are quasi-static in the weak ferromagnetic phase, whereas the fluctuating component becomes dominant at lower temperatures and persists even at 0.3 K. Such a thermal evolution is rather anomalous. Finally, we discuss two possible origins of the fluctuating fields observed below TN.

A maximal simplex of a simplicial complex is a simplex which is not contained in a larger simplex of the complex. A simplicial complex is pure, if all its maximal simplices are of the same dimension. Also, a free pair is defined as a pair of simplices (τ, σ) in K where τ is the only coface of σ.

We construct a gravitational lens model for LAE 221724+001716. We use the so-called Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model (e.g., Binney & Merrified 1998) for LAE 221724+001716. This lens model is appropriate for describing the actual density distribution of the dark matter halo of a galaxy. Moreover, this SIS lens model has only one parameter, that is, the velocity dispersion for the foreground galaxy, σ. Thus, it is also convenient to estimate the gravitational magnification factor that is given below:
There are alternative solutions in terms of the source function a(r); but they are determined by the relations stated above between f and g, on the one hand, and a and b on the other.

A protein is composed by a long chain of a few hundred amino-acids and its chemical composition is specified by the sequence of aminoacids (primary structure). In physiological situations, normally a protein folds in an unique way (tertiary structure). During the folding, the protein goes to the configuration of minimal energy (more precisely, to the configuration of minimal free energy). However, there are many quite different configurations of the protein which have an energy near the minimal one. There are proteins, which are called allosteric, which have two configurations which practically the same energy). Sometimes, if we perturb the protein by a small amount, e.g. changing the pH or changing only one amino acid in the chain, the folding changes dramatically. We can also select one of the two different configuration by the binding of a ligand.

It is interesting to note that the values which we have used are on the boundary for the onset of chaos, as the galaxy is assumed stable. In other words, the stability of the system appears to be related to the existence of a minimum, finite unit of action, and therefore, ultimately, to quantum mechanics.

Subsequently, we calculate the nuclear responses in a number of relativistic mean-field models with and without RPA correlations and with various treatments of vacuum polarization.

Detection of the Q series allows an estimate of the extinction toward these blobs from pairs of lines arising from the same upper level v=1-0 S(1), Q(3), S(0), Q(2) (Beckwith et al. 1979). These ratios render an approximate visual extinction of 7 mag. In our excitation diagrams, we compare the (unreddened) measured line ratios of several lines to the predictions of both an LTE model at 2000K and a high-density photodissociation region model (Draine & Bertoldi, 1996). The measured line ratios are well fit by a purely thermal single-temperature model of around 3000K. The low extinction measured suggests that a high-density PDR and a strong UV field can be ruled out in favor of a shock scenario. The confirmation of the shock nature of the line emission associated to nr114 therefore reinforces the hypothesis that this source is extremely young.
The specific ionization states indicated by the observed lines suggest that there are a number of components with different values of ξ, the density form of the ionization parameter. However, these all have the same value (Ξ = Ξc) of the pressure form of the ionization parameter. Above Ξc, low-temperature equilibria do not exist, and the temperature rises from ≃ 3 × 104 K to ≃ 106 K with Ξ very nearly constant at Ξc. If these components coexist at the same distance from the central source, they share the same pressure, suggesting a volume-filling configuration by which the pressure is regulated. If the volume-filling phase is the highest attainable temperature on the marginally stable branch of the thermal equilibrium curve, the actual distance could be substantially smaller than the maximum; a factor of ten smaller would not be surprising.

Conclusions
The non-thermalization in the closely neighborhood does not mean that there are no thermalized regions. When the local thermalization by the Hawking radiation is realized, the local temperature distribution T(r) should be a function of distance from the center of the black hole r because of its spherical symmetry. The Hawking radiation initially should thermalize a sphere with the radius
We now describe an O(log(n)log(1/ε))-bit protocol for EQ. First of all, Alice and Bob agree on a finite field whose size is between 2n and 4n (such a field always exists, and its elements can be represented as O(log(n))-bit strings). Now, consider the two polynomials

Combining cluster membership with photometry allows for more accurate determinations of properties such as age, distance, and to some extent metallicity. Cluster membership is particularly important in crowded fields where field star contamination is high, because not only does it separate the cluster from the field, which allows for more accurate determination of the cluster properties, it also allows for specific selection of cluster stars for future observations with spectroscopy for elemental abundances.

To minimize the uncertainty due to experimental differences between the 1999 and 2002 data, we normalized the yield of ω mesons with carbon targets in the 1999 data to that in 2002 data and extracted the absolute cross sections in p + p collisions. Another uncertainty arose from the difference in the target thicknesses that were measured with an accuracy of 0.8%. We obtained 20.1% and 20.0% as the systematic uncertainty in p + p collisions for the ω meson production and φ meson production, respectively.

Dwarf galaxies have long presented a particular challenge to CDM. Most people are now familiar with the problem that CDM models tend to produce steep luminosity functions and too many low-luminosity galaxies (e.g., White & Frenk 1991; Kauffmann, White, & Guiderdoni 1993). It is usually assumed that this can be cured by invoking supernova (SN) feedback, but most models for SN feedback are currently quite ad hoc, and it is important to obtain better direct observational constraints on this process.

Let us first describe how thermodynamical results can be derived from general relativity. As a simple example, we consider the gas of a single bosonic state at temperature T in a 3-dimensional torus T3, which is nothing but a box with periodic boundary conditions and large volume Vbox = (2πRbox)3. The number of particles is not fixed and the canonical ensemble partition function Zth is defined in terms of the Hamiltonian H and inverse temperature β. In second quantized formalism, Zth can be expressed as a path integral

In conclusion, CuNCN, the first nitrogen-based analogue of CuO, with a surprisingly low magnetic susceptibility, lacks magnetic ordering down to at least 63 mK. A magnetically highly disordered state has been witnessed below 80 K by complementary local probes. Alternatively to a SG-like frozen state featuring an unprecedented broadness of inhomogeneous static and dynamic phase, no well-defined freezing temperature and no conventional susceptibility-fingerprint SG features, a dynamical spin liquid is proposed. The fragility of the electronic state to perturbations seems to be a peculiarity of carbodiimides as opposed to more conventional oxides.

This criterion provides a necessary and sufficient condition for any static spherical configuration to be compatible with the structure of general relativity, and may be used to construct core-envelope models of stellar objects like neutron stars with vanishing and non-vanishing surface densities, such that for an assigned value of central pressure to central density, the average density of the configuration should always remain less than or equal to the density of the homogeneous sphere for the same mass.

We have obtained the general solution of the Friedmann and DBI field equations for a constant Lorentz factor when the DBI field is driven by an exponential potential. The general solutions has been split into three subsets, power law solutions, an explicit particular solutions and the implicit general solution. We have shown that they all share the property that at early and at late times they behave asymptotically as power law solutions. The first subset of solutions exhibit enhanced inflation under a form invariance transformation. On the other hand, the asymptotic behavior of the remaining two subsets of solutions at late times indicates that inflation becomes more probable and it is enhanced by the γ factor.

To analyze the stability of these solutions we need to calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix

Here I will present some results concerning eight selected bursts detected by the BeppoSAX (BSAX) and RossiXTE (RXTE) satellites in 1996-2000 and their impact on the current understanding on the physics of GRBs.

In conclusion, we have grown high-quality Y0.6Pr0.4Ba2Cu3O7/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 superlattices. The interfacial reconstruction was studied by linearly polarized X-ray absorption at the Cu L3-edge. Similar to the interface between optimally doped YBCO and LCMO, we observed dramatic modifications including charge transfer and OR at the interfacial CuO2 plane of Pr-doped YBCO due to the strongly hybridized covalent bond between Cu and Mn. However, differences such as reduced charge transfer and more bulk-like orbital occupation were also found. This is presumably related to the Pr-doping which removes holes from the ZR state and suppresses SC. Neutron reflectivity data revealed temperature-dependent, oscillatory diffuse scattering, indicative of a significant in-plane modulation, which can be attributed to buckling of the superlattice film due to the structural phase transition of the STO substrate.
The reaction amplitude is determined by six independent invariant amplitudes (form factors), which are specified by the following parametrization:

Precisely, we consider approximating functionals of mixing processes, where the approximation is in probability, not in an Lp sense as in the usual near epoch dependence condition. We call this approximation concept P -near epoch dependence. It generalizes Lp-near epoch dependence, not requiring the existence of any moments, and is hence a fitting framework for nonparametric and robust data analysis.

This means that if one were to compare such a mass measured today with the same mass measured billions of years ago, then one could determine that there had been a change because a pure number (in this case the number of nucleons in a star) was different.
We see that COrE and SPT/ACT can only be expected to measure mass for the most massive systems in the universe, while Planck cannot be expected to measure any individual cluster mass. The sensitivity of these experiments, however, is sufficient to obtain mean mass as a function of other cluster observables by binning measurements; in other words, to establish mean observable-mass scaling relations. Herein lies the value of our matched filter approach, by providing a means of combining many low signal-to-noise measurements to statistically determine cluster mass. The sensitivity of SPT-Pol, SPT-3G/ACT-Pol and the PRISM mission, on the other hand, is sufficient to enable individual cluster mass measurements as well as statistical studies.

In the present work we study the effect of embedded boron clusters on the electronic and magnetic properties of graphene systems. We consider 2D graphene and 1D AGNRs and ZGNRs. These systems are substitutionally doped with B7 clusters to create (1) localized states, (2) local sublattice imbalances and (3) localized magnetic moments. We find that the B7 clusters locally metallize the graphene matrix, and that linear chains of boron clusters form metallic wires inside the graphene matrix. Furthermore the presence of the B7 clusters in magnetic ZGNR weakens the magnetism in such systems.

In this Letter, we theoretically study the exciton dynamics and the resulting emission properties of linear chains carrying small-radius excitons. We account for both exciton localization by static disorder and scattering of the excitons on lattice vibrations. The interplay of nonequilibrium conditions and the local band-edge level structure of disordered chains leads to interesting effects in the emission. A comparison to experiment is made.
Following standard diagram technique we distinguish three types of electron states which are presented on a diagram by three different types on lines:

In light of these developments we must ask to what extent the familiar properties of (2, 2) theories, such as mirror symmetry, special geometry, and the computability of Yukawa couplings continue to hold in generic (0, 2) models. This is not idle curiosity: the presence of the (0, 2) deformations of (2, 2) theories indicates that even in such a familiar example as the heterotic string compactified on the quintic, we only understand a slice of the full moduli space!

Next we would like to point out that the above R- and L-systems bear a striking resemblance to the right- and left-movers in string theory and there exists a close relationship between the thermodynamics of these systems and that of effective strings or D-branes.

The universality of both charged and neutral weak interactions, combined with the discovery of predicted top quark, strongly suggests that the weak interactions are described by a gauge theory. Or in other words, the W ± and Z0 bosons are gauge bosons. This is a natural analogue of the fact that other known universal forces, namely gravity, which acts univerally on all bodies (equivalence principle), and electromagnetism, which gives universal Coulomb force which does not depend on the properties of matter but only on their electric charges, are described by gauge theories. In fact, the universality was the main motivation for Glashow to describe the weak interactions by his SU(2)×U(1) gauge theory, or electroweak theory.

Many accidental band degeneracies, say the degeneracies in Weyl semimetals, are considered to be protected by topology. The theorem proved above tells that any degeneracy must be protected by a HAS. Then, what is the relation between the HAS protection and topological protection for the accidental degeneracies? In the following, we will elaborate the relation between them and illustrate that the HAS protection does not contradict with the topological protection.

These distributions demonstrate a degree of insensitivity to the choice of merging scale, which has been varied over an order of magnitude, however there is still some residual dependence on this choice. While the parton shower and merged matrix element treatments formally have the same large logarithm behavior, there are differences between the two. The degree of these differences will directly influence the amount of residual dependence on the merging scale that is observed. In changing the merging scale we are changing the volume of the matrix element phase space region and therefore changing the proportion of parton emissions that are corrected by exact matrix elements.

In the following we present adaptive schemes for choosing the number of processors that apply both to offspring populations as well as island models of EAs. We accompany our schemes by a rigorous theoretical analysis of their running time. Both schemes double the number of processors if the current generation fails to produce an offspring that has larger fitness than the current best fitness value. Otherwise, if the generation yields an improvement, the number of processors is decreased again. The difference between the two schemes lies in the way the number of processors is decreased.

In this paper, we present a theoretical study of the current-induced dynamics of skyrmions that correctly accounts for the effects of SOC on both current-induced torques and magnetization damping. Our results demonstrate that SOC generates reactive and dissipative homogeneous SOTs that lead to important corrections to the drift velocity along the current direction and to the Magnus force. Another essential consequence of the SOC is that the skyrmions experience effective damping and torque parameters that depend on the current direction relative to the crystallographic axes.

This last result seems to invalidate the approximation k2 ≫ φ2k and to cast doubts on the consistency of these results. However, if we write φ2k = ck2, with c a constant, and insert in (3.6,14), it is easy to see that the conclusions of the previous analysis are confirmed; only the numerical coefficients appearing in (3.16) would be modified.

This paper is concerned with linear multi-input multi-output control systems, governed in state space by Ito stochastic differential equations, driven by a standard Wiener process which is regarded as a random disturbance. The integral of the squared Euclidean norm of the system output over a bounded time interval is interpreted as energy. In the disturbance attenuation paradigm, the output energy is to be minimized in some sense.

ASP is able to express epistemic examples by interpreting an answer set as a set of literals that are believed by a rational agent. This is one of the most radical ways in which ASP departs from classical logic, in which models or interpretations always represent the objective state of the world. In the classical setting, one typically resorts to sets of interpretations (or the related concept of a Kripke structure) to represent beliefs.

Recall that an irreducible homogeneous vector bundle on a homogeneous space Σ = G/P is defined by an irreducible representation of P, which is in turn defined by its highest weight: some weight λ of G which is P-dominant. We denote the corresponding bundle by Eλ.
Detectors of high energy cosmic-ray and neutrinos currently under construction may allow to identify the sources of UHECRs. Such identification will provide only a partial resolution of the puzzle. A major challenge will remain in understanding the physics of the sources. GRBs and AGN are the most powerful astronomical objects, and are likely candidates for the production of ultra-high energy protons and neutrinos. In both, the energy source is likely to be mass accretion onto a black hole, leading to relativistic outflows. The models describing these objects are largely phenomenological, and major open questions remain regarding the underlying physics. Data from the new experiments may allow to resolve some of these open questions.
In our main theorem, we will see that is possible to randomly perturb a non-uniformly expanding map so that almost all randomly perturbed orbits have infinitely many hyperbolic times but also the same hyperbolic times as the non-perturbed map. We start with a one-dimensional version.

Finally, for the case of a subformula ψ = E > kθ1 Uθ2, for k > 0, the algorithm behaves in a similar way. It first determines the nodes of M which satisfy E > 0θ1Uθ2 and then it determines, for each node u ∈ S, whether u satisfies ψ, with an approach suggested by the following claim.

Nevertheless, the importance of outflows on the energy balance of a region is likely to depend on the physical properties of the region. However, it is observationally difficult to measure the direct injection of turbulence due to outflows and assess its impact on star formation. One reason is that in dynamic cluster-forming regions, with large-scale motions, and on-going star formation, the direct effect of outflows can be easily confused and masked by other dynamical events.
Thus, the rate of speed becomes

It is worth to pointing that our mGNM and mANM methods are not unique. How to design optimal new mGNM and mANM methods is still an open problem. Essentially, we hope these new methods are efficient, accurate and robust. More specifically, high accuracy in B-factor prediction is a main criterion. Additionally, having the ability to provide correct protein domain analysis is a desirable property as well. For mANM, the capability of offering correct motion analysis is a major requirement. The quality of both domain and motion analyses depends on how to design non-diagonal matrix elements so as to properly reflect the physical connectivity among particles.

We have demonstrated the capability of this model for simulating the emergence of Characean streaming. For the computational study, we focussed on the roles of the polarization and flow-coupling constants αp and αu. Perhaps the next most important parameter is the directional repulsion κ, which we have not investigated in detail here. The value we chose, κ = 0.5, is a nice intermediate providing a definite preference for upwards orientation, but not so strong as to completely dominate the early-time dynamics. On the other hand, if κ is too small, then little or no directional effects are felt, and the dynamics may be either unsteady or settle into circumferential flows.

It may be noted that the issue really is one appearing at low statistics. We can give some intuition for the observed effect. Consider the likely scenario at low statistics that some bins will have zero counts in both histograms. In this case our algorithm for the estimated null hypothesis yields a zero mean for these bins. The simulation used to determine the probability distribution for the test statistic will always have zero counts in these bins, that is, there will always be agreement between the two histograms in these bins. Thus, the simulation will find that values of the test statistic are more probable than it should.

In real life examples, like the heartbeat RR time series, outliers due to noise, missing beats or extra systoles that appear in the recorded signal might alter the scaling exponent calculation.

It is interesting to note that the radio continuum source toward which the HI is detected (Figure 3) is the location where the radio jet begins to change its position angle. This would suggest that, as for example in the case of 3C 236 (Conway 1999), the H I absorption marks the location of a jet/cloud interaction responsible for disturbing (and possibly bending) the jet. However, the B2352+495 morphology is quite symmetric in both radio lobes which suggests that the deviation of the radio jets is not due to local jet/cloud interactions but governed by the large scale magnetohydrodynamical properties of the galactic nucleus. In the next section, we propose a different interpretation for the nature of the H I absorption in B2352+495.

When the couplings between the hidden strange and non strange sectors are ignored, bound states are observed in both sectors. Hence there are a total of 6 hidden beauty resonances, with binding energies 34 MeV (178 MeV) with respect to the non strange threshold, and 6 hidden beauty-hidden strange resonances, with binding energies 2 MeV (18 MeV) with respect to the hidden strange threshold, for a cutoff value of qmax = 415 MeV (qmax = 830 MeV). The hidden beauty-hidden strange resonances are found to be weakly bound.
Beyond the above results on existence of solutions, there has always been a great interest in knowing the qualitative behaviour of the solutions either in the large-time limit or, for gelling systems, for times immediately before the singularity. This has been attempted by the so-called scaling description of the Smoluchowski equations, to which we now turn. Here we consider the non-gelling case. Scaling theory is then concerned with the large-size behaviour of the cluster size distribution c(m, t). It therefore deals exclusively with a limit in which time and size go jointly to infinity in a manner to be described shortly.

This means that this delay is not part of the time wasting by a pair while it could send because its neighbors are not sending. To the contrary, neighbor senders are not sending during the backoff delay.

The derivation of the drift velocity assumes that the dust, once separated from the gas shell, moves at a constant velocity.

Entangled states, to which squeezed states are closely related, have been extensively studied in the last few years because of their potential application in quantum information processing and quantum computing. In this paper, we discuss squeezing and entanglement in terms of the quasiparticle modes of a trapped gas. Quasiparticle modes represent collective excitations of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and are in fact one of the most fundamental features of its dynamics. They are easily generated by applying time-dependent perturbations to the trapping potential, and were observed experimentally quite early on; they have since been studied in some detail both theoretically and experimentally.

Finally, the combination of the bandgap renormalization and the exciton screening tend to cancel and, consistent with experiments, the recombination energy remains relatively constant with ne. This result is plotted in figure 6 but discussed at the end of section III.
So far, we assumed that the system size N (the number of cells) is constant, which is a good approximation for an adult organism; in a developing organism, however, proportion regulation has to work under the condition of a steadily growing system size. Here, we study this problem for two simplified settings: first, for symmetric growth, i.e., new cells are added with probability 1/2 on either side of the chain of cells, and the growth rate rg is constant on average; second, for homogeneous cell proliferation with probability pd per cell, assuming that daughter cells inherit the state of the mother cell.

Highly-charged ions constitute a testbed for the understanding of the electronic structure of matter, because they can be considered a subclass of atoms in which the basic physical parameters take on extreme values.
In summary, we have found that a THz field may cause dynamical separations of the DNA double-strand. In the presence of weak perturbations e.g. thermal fluctuations, small amplitude response occurs (at half the driving frequency) either in a spatially uniform manner or, at higher-frequencies, in an unusual spatially dimerized form. In the latter case, neighboring base pairs oscillate in an out-of-phase fashion. However, large localized openings (bubbles) in the DNA double strand can only occur via a nonlinear mechanism requiring a spatial perturbation above a certain amplitude threshold that is determined by the intensity and the frequency of the THz field.
Evolving domains
Our method has been developed for a particular kind of RCT design. The RCT must have two arms, one continuous endpoint, and the observations must be independent. Implementing extensions to longitudinal or panel data, to binary, count and survival outcomes, and more than two arms are challenging next steps.

Using numerical simulations allows us to quickly explore many possible definitions of the scaling constants with little uncertainty in, for example, the total galaxy mass or velocity dispersion. The simulated galaxies are of course imperfect stand-ins for actual galaxies, but our hope is that working with simulated galaxies will allow us to eliminate many of the definitions that are possible and focus on one (or a few) that seem to work well. Only the most successful choices when compared to simulations will be considered including the additional complications inherent to observational data.

We have shown that diffuse interface methods while already being very powerful can be further generalized. We illustrated that non-smooth potentials are a viable option for the separation of data. While the computations become more expensive due to the nonlinearity that is treated with the semi-smooth Newton scheme, the results in many cases show that the results are even better than for the smooth potential. Additionally, we showed that the methods are not limited to the graph Laplacian setup but can successfully be employed for the hypergraph Laplacian. Future work should incorporate more sophisticated eigenvalue methods and our goal is to further investigate different techniques for the segmentation of hypergraphs.

For the sake of a better explanation, we start with a description of the practical aspect of the adopted procedure. The Minkowski functionals of a body K in the plane are proportional to its area A(K), perimeter U(K) and the connectivity or Euler number χ(K). The usual definition of the connectivity from algebraic topology in two dimensions is the difference between the number of connected nc components and the number of holes nh,
Since the pentagon is αβ2γδ, the total number of β should be twice of the total number of α. Among the existing αβ2, γ3, δ5, the equality 2a = b always holds. Therefore to maintain this doubling relation between the total numbers of α and β, we either have 2a = b for all the vertices, or have vertices with 2a > b as well as vertices with 2a < b.
Initially this problems were solved by the introduction of color-octet (CO) components of the quarkonia, that arise naturally in the non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD), where the expansion over the relative velocity of quarks in meson is performed. In this model it is assumed, that final meson is formed from heavy quark pair in color-octet state, that subsequently transforms into a physically observed colorless meson. In the framework of NRQCD the probabilities of these transitions are described by the matrix elements of four-fermion operators, that are determined from the experimental distributions over the transverse momentum of final charmonium. We would like to stress, however, that this explanation will not work for charmonium production at lower energies. The reason is that the distributions caused by octet components decreases slowly with the rise of the transverse momentum, but the probability to find such a component in the meson is small, compared with the singlet case. As a result, in the large transverse momentum region the contribution of octet components can be significant, but for small energies and transverse momenta it is suppressed.

Stationary cyclic Gaussian processes
The statistical uncertainties of the eclipse maps were estimated with a Monte Carlo procedure (e.g., Rutten et al. 1992). A set of 20 artificial light curves is generated, in which the data points are independently and randomly varied according to a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation equal to the uncertainty at that point. The light curves are fitted with the eclipse mapping algorithm to produce a set of randomized eclipse maps. These are combined to produce an average map and a map of the residuals with respect to the average, which yields the statistical uncertainty at each pixel.
In particular, we have demonstrated that it should be possible to detect extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs around such A-F type stars: detection limits arrive at the planetary domain for most of them.

Neutrino experiments based outside the U.S. in which U.S. nuclear physicists play a leading role include the CUORE neutrinoless double β-decay experiment in Gran Sasso, the KamLAND-Zen neutrinoless double β-decay experiment in Kamioka, and the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment at Guangdong Province in China. In addition, U.S. physicists are involved in most of the experiments at SNOLAB and play a leading role in many of them. The KATRIN collaboration, which has a strong U.S. involvement, unites in Germany the world-wide expertise in tritium β-decay to probe the absolute mass scale of neutrinos. The MAJORANA Collaboration is working cooperatively with the GERDA Collaboration in Europe towards an international ton-scale germanium double β-decay experiment that combines best features of the two programs.
The swimmer, a q-swimmer, is an object with internal degrees of freedom which, we assume, are slow and classical while the degrees of freedom of the medium are fast and quantum. Swimming is accomplished by the internal degrees of freedom, the controls, undergoing periodic cycles. An example of a q-swimmer might be a molecule immersed in a quantum gas.

In classical theory of PDEs, two important classes of equations are: elliptic and parabolic PDEs. They are second-order PDEs, with some constraints (coerciveness) in the higher-order terms. The elliptic equations typically model the flow of some chemical quantity within some region, whereas the parabolic equations model the time evolution of such quantities. Consider the following particular classes of elliptic and parabolic equations:

In a nilpotent group G of class ≤2, two conjugates of any element t ∈ G commute. Therefore, as an immediate consequence of Lemma 2.1, we observe that any two polynomial automorphisms of G commute. Since these automorphisms generate P(G), we obtain:

Noise of the type modelled here can be distinguished from other noise sources. For instance, in trapped-ion systems, if Johnson-Nyquist noise is the dominant source of fluctuating electric fields, this will predominantly originate in the attendant electronics in the system, rather than the ion-trap electrodes themselves. Consequently the noise level varies as a function of the temperature of the electronics. In contrast, noise due to dielectric coverings on the electrodes varies as a function of the electrode temperature, which can be controlled independently of the attendant electronics.
5. Proposal for an experimental realisation
The discussion above assumes that the luminosity distance is extracted individually from each supernova. If the sample is large enough, one can instead split the supernovae into N bins of redshift and average the observed flux over all supernovae in the same bin. This average can be considered as an approximate angular average, or equivalently expectation over true source positions (per redshift bin) for fixed size angular patches:

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we define the entanglement entropy for a snapshot, which is a key ingredient in this paper, and present outline of our method. Then, in Sec. III, basic properties of the entanglment entropy and the entanglement spectrum for square-lattice Ising ferromagnet are presented. The main objective is to show temperature and system-size dependence of the entropy as well as the spectrum in order to extract scaling relations. We also examine entanglement support of our method by changing the number of the singular values which are taken into account. In Sec. IV, coarse-grained snapshots are shown, and we discuss about the key mechanism of the length-scale control hidden in the SVD. In Sec. V, we examine the 3-state Potts model in order to confirm universality of our scaling relations obtained in the analysis of the Ising model. In Sec. VI, we discuss about the topological entanglement entropy in a viewpoint of the entanglement gap. Finally, we summarize our results.
Thus, we now fix U and V with this condition.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the setup considered here is described and generalized Einstein equations with time dependence are explicitly expressed. In the simplest case of an isolated two-brane system, we give the higher dimensional Friedmann-type equation on the brane. In section 3, we solve the static (5 + D)-dimensional Randall-Sundrum model with the bulk cosmological constant Λ. For each case of Λ < 0, Λ > 0, and Λ = 0, the (4 + D)-dimensional metric functions can be obtained. We show that the forms of the warped metric functions and the relation between the brane tensions on the orbifold depend on the integration constant appearing in the Einstein equations as well as on the sign of the bulk cosmological constant. A summary and discussion are given in the final section. In an appendix, we review the Kasner solution of the (4 + D)-dimensional anisotropic cosmological model.
There is no reason to believe the above approximation when b < lNC. In this case the interactions between an instanton and an anti-instanton is well described by the gauge fields which are low energy modes of IIB matrix model. They are close to diagonal degrees of freedom in IIB matrix model. Their contribution can be estimated by gauge theory. The one loop effective potential can be calculated by gauge theory certainly when b < < lNC
From the annealed approximation we expect the stationary distribution not to depend on l, but in fact we could observe different behaviours for different l values. So the data analysis is rather complex since for every point (K, ρ) in parameter space three varables, N, t and l, are involved and different limits, e.g. N large at fixed t and l or t and l large at fixed N, may give different behaviours.
We expect that massive stars are likely to be responsible for the significant number of bright red infrared matches to the hard X-ray sources in the Sgr B region. Indeed, this area contains the most massive molecular cloud known in the Galaxy, in which over 60 ultra-compact H ii regions are embedded (Gaume et al. 1995; de Pree et al. 1998). Naturally, this is a site of vigorous, massive star formation. Infrared spectroscopy of red matches in this region will likely reveal hot supergiants, similar to those already identified near the Arches and Quintuplet clusters. The identification of such stars near Sgr B will constrain the history and mode of massive star formation in this region.

This brings us to the subject of single-event measurements: event mixing is, of course, not possible when there is just one available. For the proposed measurement of Bose-Einstein correlations in single events in nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC, the solution is clearly to normalize by event mixing based on a sample of similar events. Most notably, this mixing sample should have the same multiplicity and general characteristics; such requirements will necessarily restrict the sample to relatively few events, so that the bias corrections may become important.

Our result is valid at arbitrary level-separa iotns ω, and thus bridges the known asymptotic behaviors of correlations between close-by and far-distant levels.
Using this division, we note that the particles within one section are independent from the particles in the other sections, i.e., the state of the particle (whether it is frozen or not) depends only on the structure within its section, and not on the configuration of neighboring sections.
Finally, the unique sensitivity of SKA will allow to follow the development of flares with unprecedented details and time-resolution. A typical, solar-type weak flare (0.1 mJy at 1.3 pc) can be detected in 5 sec with SKA1 (5σ). Such kind of observation will provide new insights in the open question of coronal heating and, in particular, a piece of evidence that the radio quiescent corona is maintained by a series of micro-flares.

How to move an electromagnetic field?
then we find
Extensive calculations obtained with three independent stellar evolution codes have enabled us to consistently induce or remove GNLs according to the helium-composition profile at the end of core-helium burning. We have shown that GNLs are not favored by higher metallicities or lower masses, as postulated by Bono et al. (1997a,b). Rather, GNLs are produced by the narrowness of the helium-burning region when the helium-burning shell ignites immediately following core-helium exhaustion. This is most influenced by the way that the convective and semiconvective regions are calculated at the completion of core-helium burning and further illustrates our incomplete knowledge of this complicated phase. If we could observationally determine the existence, or otherwise, of GNLs, it would be a direct probe into the helium profile at helium exhaustion and hence provide information about the occurrence of core-breathing pulses.
To complete the proof of Theorem 4.1, we summarize our situation: we have a nontrivial semi-simple group Der uc(H) with an irreducible unitary representation. Furthermore, it has a special element x whose image under the representation has exactly two distinct eigenvalues whose ratio is not ±1.
Another important aspect is that for many quantities of phenomenological relevance, there exist a large number of calculations using different actions, different approaches to renormalization, etc. Furthermore, lattice theorists are curious to try out new approaches so that more recent does not necessarily imply more reliable or accurate. The situation can thus be very confusing for non-experts, as it is even for experts! It would therefore be very useful to have a body of theoreticians well versed in the different possible lattice approaches, which could review the situation and provide a succinct and reliable summary of the state of the art. We also owe it to ourselves to make the best possible use of the results and experience that we have accumulated.

In this paper we have studied the fluid squeeze-out from the interface between an elastic block with a flat surface and a randomly rough surface of a rigid solid. We have calculated the (average) interfacial separation as a function of time by considering the fluid flow using a contact mechanics theory in combination with thin-film hydrodynamics with flow factors (which are functions of the (local) interfacial separation) obtained using a recently developed theory. We have explained the importance of the large length-scale elastic deformations on the squeeze out.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that the Coulomb repulsion can bound electrons in multi-well periodic structures, so that a current of entangled electrons with opposite spins would appear. The propagation of such electron pairs across the system is dominated by direct two-electron transitions absent in the standard Hubbard model. We expect that these two-electron transitions play an important role in different physical processes.
On the other hand, it can be shown that the non-vanishing surface gravity on dS-horizon given in GR is actually a kind of inertial force, which leads to the departure from a uniform-velocity motion along straight line.

So far we have discussed emission in constant classical fields. However, one of the defining features of a QED-plasma is that the emission processes can influence these fields. Radiation reaction exerts a drag force, altering the velocity of the electrons and positrons and so altering the current in the plasma. Although no net current is produced in the pair production process, it acts as a source of current carriers. Subsequent acceleration by the background fields separates the electron and positron which then alter the current in the plasma. These modifications to the current effect the evolution of the macroscopic fields.

In conclusion, the DM interpretation of the 3 events reported by the CDMS-II collaboration is not entirely excluded by XENON10/100. This mass region is very interesting theoretically and can be accessed with relatively small experiments employing light target nuclei. In view of our ignorance concerning the possible interactions of DM, it is essential that experimental searches employ as many different target nuclei as is possible.
Since we identify the AD flat direction as the inflaton that has an initial value larger than the Planck mass in the chaotic inflation, the supergravity effects should be taken into account. In the framework of supergravity, the effective potential is modified as
In fact,
Not all stars that are born in binaries are expected to show this peculiar chemistry from AGB accretion. Close binaries cannot evolve up the AGB because they undergo mass transfer before or during shell hydrogen burning on the first giant branch. Very wide binaries have stars that are so far separated that they do not interact except through their mutual gravitational attraction. The intermediate cases are those which interest us: the binary must be wide enough to allow evolution up the AGB, but close enough that there is mass transfer (probably) by wind accretion.
At this point it is important to examine whether NSI can obscure the discovery of the standard CP violation due to δ and the neutrino mass hierarchy, and if yes to what extent.

In practice, the behavior of free bosons over generic discrete structures is made experimentally accessible through the realization of suitable arrays of Josephson junctions. The latter are devices that can be engineered in such a way as to realize a variety of non-homogeneous patterns.

This Theorem implies the following result:
Marginal sub-criticality of the ISM on average is probably no coincidence (Shu et al. 1999). Heavily supercritical gas clouds have long since collapsed to form stars. To induce the remaining clouds to collapse, any process has to overcome their notional stability. Successful processes only form stars with a low efficiency per unit collapse time scale because magnetic flux on a large scale cannot be destroyed but can only be redistributed. Thus, gas that becomes supercritical and collapses can only do so by making the remaining gas more subcritical and less prone to collapse.

Finally, let us note that one single definite example of unstable physically relevant solution in the theory with higher derivatives would mean that the situation with the (in)stability of vacuum in this theory becomes definitely negative. In view of the great relevance of higher derivatives, especially for quantization of matter fields on curved background, this would mean the necessity of some dramatic changes in our understanding, starting from the semiclassical approach to gravity. However, after considerations presented in this work, we have an expectation that the situation with higher derivatives in a theory based on a unique Planck scale can be resolved.

The spectra of supernova remnants are very similar to those of foreground stars. Following P04 we assumed that all foreground stars have been identified from the correlation with optical data leaving any remaining sources that fit the HR criteria as supernova remnant candidates. Again, HRs were calculated for typical supernova remnant spectra (absorbed thermal plasma models with temperatures of 0.5 keV and 1.0 keV) over the same range of column densities as before. All the HRs calculated were within the original criteria and so the criteria were not modified.

QUANTUM LANGEVIN EQUATIONS
Because it is often desirable to look at Feynman diagrams for the process being calculated, MadGraph generates a postscript file with these diagrams and the amplitude they correspond to in the code. In principle, graph generation should be trivial once all of the particles and vertices are determined. However, determining anesthetic arrangement of the vertices and particles requires some thought. The algorithm used in MadGraph minimizes the sum of the length squared of the lines. This does not always produce perfectly symmetric diagrams, however it is a fairly easy procedure to implement and the diagrams are adequate for research purposes. For each four-gluon vertex there are actually three identical graphs rather than just one. This is necessary to account for the three different color factors in a single four gluon vertex.

We have shown that a simple mode with constrained dynamics like the HOSS model, is rich enough to reproduce the Kovacs memory effect, even allowing to obtain analytical expression for the Kovacs hump in a long time regime. The Kovacs effect is observed in many experiments and models, showing common qualitative properties which we have found to be shared also by the model analyzed in this paper. The quantitative properties depend on the particular system or model analyzed.

With this restriction, and the assumption of a power-law primary spectrum, the problem simply amounts to determining how the normalization of the illuminating spectrum at some given energy (E = Eth, say), integrated over the surface of the slab, is affected by the source motion. Making use of the phase space invariant Iν/ν3, we see that the SR enhancement in absolute iron line production is

Computing the kernels H and N involves the consideration of Feynman graphs, where the internal legs represent propagators for a particle in a closed space. This calculation may be carried out exactly, but the result is that, unless for orbits with very small amplitude, the effect of spatial curvature is not really important. It is convenient to compute these kernels as in a spatially flat FRW Universe with the same radius, which amounts to consider a continuous, rather than a discrete, spectrum of modes. The result is
The structure factor is defined to characterize the solid order:
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Setting
It remains to adapt the PF allocation to account for practical placement constraints that occur in data centers. These include the requirement to allocate CPU and RAM on the same server, for example, or to use a specific type of server for some jobs. It is also of interest to incorporate hierarchical scheduling criteria whereby the departments originating certain classes of jobs have overall service rate guarantees. Available trace data suggests cluster resources are currently significantly over-provisioned so that optimized sharing is hardly an issue in practice. In future, however, one would expect tighter energy management leading to a requirement for more closely controlled performance. The key to this would be analytical modelling enabling one to predict performance given system capacity and load, by applying the robust engineering techniques developed over recent years for networks, for example.

The reason is, the electron wave that initially propagates toward wall, a part of it is absorbed. Due to this absorption, the reflected part will possess low intensity electron wave. This reflected part appears coming from the image behind the wall. Two path interference occurs on a screen placed at very large distance from the system. Consequently, we observe a decrease in the oscillation amplitude of photodetachment cross section.

Note that this voltage is proportional to L and, thus, sufficiently large voltage signals can be measured even for small γ values by increasing the sample length. Furthermore, note that for the case of the normal layer thickness tN being comparable to the spin diffusion length λsd the measured voltage depends only very weakly on either value, since tN/λsd tan h(tN/2λsd) is approximately constant.

It is well established that, in the context of Newtonian dynamics, the observable mass in spiral galaxies cannot account for the observed flat rotation curves in the outer regions of galaxies (Bosma 1978; Begeman 1987, van Albada et al. 1985). The standard explanation for this discrepancy is the proposal that galaxies are embedded in an extended dark halo which dominates the gravitational field in the outer regions (Trimble 1987).
But there is absolutely nothing granting us that this Boolean description (thought necessary to exert experiments) will exhaust the scenario in which phenomena appear. And this lies at the heart of the existence of complementary (and incompatible) contexts in quantum mechanics: in order to determine the state of the system, a quantum tomography must be exerted, and thus, we are obliged to study the system in different incompatible contexts. While the structuration of experience in CM can be reduced to a boolean algebra (and thus, to a set theoretical description provided by an outcome set), in QM this is no longer possible. In classical mechanics, the description of an object can be equated with its space-time representation: form the point of view of classical mechanics, the main goal is to describe continuous motion of material bodies inside space. That is why motion (and change) can be described as the solutions of deterministic differential equations. And this feature is much more general than the usual description of a particle moving through space under the action of forces. Any quantity of interest taking continuous values, if it is classical, will have associated a time derivative, and thus the description reduces to the motion of a system in a phase space obeying deterministic differential equations. Quite contrarily, quantum mechanics is characterized by jumps, by discontinuous and unpredictable behavior. That is why the organization of experience in QM comes endowed with a probabilistic description: it is impossible to predict the future events with complete certainty, and thus, the actual state of affairs is just a probability distribution.
In cases of strong absorption, i.e. above 40 %, the method is limited by the fluctuations in the night-sky background light and the effect cannot be corrected completely.

In general our strategy is the following. We want to study the properties of a given Hamiltonian HG which is not random. We consider a class of Hamiltonians HR, of which HG is a particular case. We choose the class HR in such a way that the statistical properties of HG and that of a generic Hamiltonian in HR are as similar as possible. In the best case we can obtain that the two corresponding free energies coincide in the high temperature expansion. In general the behaviour of the system can be controlled better in the high temperature phase.

If the brane has a finite width, or if it is not infinitely well localized, the exchange of KK modes will be suppressed for KK wavelengths shorter than the width of the brane, or the size of its fluctuations. This will therefore give an effective cut-off (denoted Ms) for high KK masses, which does not have to be of the same magnitude as the fundamental Planck mass MD.

The largest deviation was found for the case K = 3, where the annealed approximation gives α = 0.182 while our simulations give αL = 0.210, αT = 0.204, αP = 0.21 and αV = 0.206 for the average variance in a given network and 0.205 for the variance between different networks.
It was recently realized that this approach described in the previous section (i.e. to predict the behavior of the system from the knowledge of the equations of motion) fails in the case of complex systems for reasons that are very similar (albeit in a different contest) to those which led to the abandonment of the Newton-Laplace view-point.
In conclusion, the results of this section show us that the computation of the eigenstates and the eigenvalues of the spl(2|1) model is still dependent of an additional eigenvalue problem for the inhomogeneous transfer matrix T(1)(λ,{λi}). We shall discuss this matter in the next section.

Knowing the relative position and peculiar velocity of each galaxy with respect to its host cluster it is easy to reproduce observations of that cluster in the form of projected cluster-centric radii and LOS velocity. The 30 systems are then stacked, scaling each by the cluster radius (r500) and velocity dispersion, σv. This stacking over many clusters is not required simply to match our observed sample, or even to contain sufficient galaxies to derive robust statistical properties (although this is important), but most importantly to even out all of the large line-of-sight variations due to the presence of infalling structures or filaments for individual cluster lines of sight and times of observation. This applies both for the simulations and the observations, motivating our use of such large cluster samples.

Each AI/ATP instance thus produces its specific temporary file (the FOF ATP problem) and runs its specific ATP system on it with its time limit. The time limit is currently set globally to 30 seconds for each instance, however (as usual in strategy scheduling setups) this could be made instance-specific too, based on further analysis of the time performance of the particular instances. Vampire and Epar already do such scheduling internally: the current version of Epar runs a fixed schedule of 14 strategies, while Vampire runs a problem-dependent schedule of several to dozen of strategies. Assuming one strategy for Z3 and on average eight strategies for Vampire, this now means that using 10-CPU parallelization results in about 100 different proof-data/feature-extraction/learning/premise-slicing/ATP-strategy instantiations tried by the online service within the 30 seconds of the real time allowed for each query. Provided sufficient complementarity of such instantiations and enough CPUs, this significantly raises the overall power of the service.

In this appendix we explore the range of angular momenta when the giant graviton states can be described as vacua of the auxiliary theory living on the gravitons. In order for this to happen, the size rg of a giant graviton of momentum L must be smaller than the size of the near-horizon region of the gravitons r0. Moreover, when the size of the giant graviton becomes smaller than the string or Planck scale, it makes sense to treat it as a KK graviton.

According to the results presented above, emission mechanisms appear rather different in the two models. For light particles, a more abundant pre-equilibrium emission (Z < 3) is observed in the BGBD case. Concerning the IMF emission mechanism, the involved time scales and the relative importance of one- and many-body effects appear different in the two models, due to the differences in the implementation of mean-field propagation and two-body scattering. In the BGBD case the fragmentation process follows the spinodal decomposition scenario. Indeed the system enters the low density region as a nearly homogeneous source, then density fluctuations are amplified. The formation of bubble-like structures is favoured, as a manifestation of monopole instabilities. In the AMD model, many-body correlations have a stronger impact on the fragmentation dynamics, while mean-field effects appear weaker. Fragment formation seems not to be directly linked with the spinodal decomposition scenario, but rather with the appearance of some pre-fragments at earlier times. As a consequence, fragments are formed on shorter time-scales in AMD. Finally, we observe that pre-equilibrium and IMF emissions happen on different time scales and are related to different mechanisms in the BGBD case, while in AMD the distinction of the two time scales is not as clear as in BGBD.
Labeling all words with a specific tag yields maximal recall for that tag, as all words occurrence of that tag are labeled correctly, yet with the price of low precision, as many words are tagged wrongly. On the other hand, not labeling even one word (or labeling all word with the special tag of no tag) yields maximal precision for all tags, as there is not even a single word that is labeled mistakenly by some tag, yet the precision is zero as none of the words that should be tagged are indeed tagged. Clearly, one can move from the second extreme to the first by labeling or tagging more and more words with some tag. In various information extraction systems it is desirable to have the ability to control the tradeoff between high precision or high recall. In some scenarios a user may prefer that the system may label fewer words with a tag (low recall) yet to have the labeled words be tagged correctly (high precision), and in another scenarios the opposite is preferred, that is, labeling more words with some tag, yet at the price of low precision.

The picture of non-linear growth of structure involves density perturbations growing in amplitude, initially by a linear growth factor, then achieving sufficient density contrast to separate from the Hubble expansion and to collapse, increasing its density in a non-linear manner. One can calculate the level to which the density contrast would have grown in linear theory by collapse time, as a convenient parameter (and an essential ingredient in Press-Schechter formalism), though the true, non-linear density contrast is much larger.

On the other hand, if the attack is launched on Flow 2 (that skips the FTP upload to the base station), it may not be as easy to detect. Since the attack uses the same functions that are invoked by legitimate code, it looks like the application is following Flow 1 (where the FTP upload is actually legitimate). In this case, only 1% of the malicious code executions were caught. The detection rates would be significantly higher if the attacker either used different images that vary in size or used code that utilizes different combinations of system calls. The latter case would also hold for the HTTP post attack. Note: the detection was not successful because we tailored the attack instance to closely match legitimate execution (especially due to our knowledge of the detection methods); however, many attacks will not be able to match legitimate execution in such a precise manner and will end up being caught.
A second ingredient of our work is the quantization scheme. The difficulty in maintaining the manifest covariance during the quantization of a gauge invariant theory is well known.

In this paper, we have calculated eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of power-law and logarithmic potentials by using variational techniques for special type wave functions. Our results are in good agreement with existing exact numerical ones. However, for the higher values of ν, there is some difference between two approaches. However this differences not larger than that one coming from 1/N expansion. Moreover, we obtained that present method predicts not only the eigenvalues as well as the eigenfunctions of given potentials. The correspondence of wavefunctions for lower energy levels is very good agreement with numerical results as expected the except case n and l are large. The method used in this study present an easy way of calculating both eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of power-law and logarithmic potentials. In spite of its simple structure, the method is very practical and the results of the method are in good agreement with exact results.

It could be speculated that the repeated recent close encounters with the terrestrial planets (Scheeres et al. 2004) and/or the non gravitational perturbations (e.g. Yorp effect, Lowry et al. 2007), related to its non spherical shape and small semimajor axis, brought the spin rate of our target to the present high value.

Now, we can prove the existence of an invariant measure.
Having proved that consensus is impossible with crash failures, we consider the conditions under which it remains impossible without crash failures. Recall, in wireless networks, unlike wired networks, the network configuration might be ad hoc, preventing nodes from having full a priori information on the participants. Accordingly, in this section and the next we explore the network information required to solve consensus. We start here by investigating the importance of unique ids. We call an algorithm that does not use unique ids an anonymous algorithm. We prove below that consensus is impossible with anonymous algorithms, even if nodes know the network size and diameter. We then provide a corollary that extends this result to the standard asynchronous network model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the necessity of unique ids for consensus in multihop message passing networks.
In the present paper we express the Laplacian of the Gauss map of a marginally trapped surface in terms of these invariant functions. Imposing the condition that the surface has pointwise 1-type Gauss map, we obtain that three of the invariants are zero. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a marginally trapped surface to have pointwise 1-type Gauss map and find all marginally trapped surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map. Our main result states that a marginally trapped surface is of pointwise 1-type Gauss map if and only if it has parallel mean curvature vector field.

At first glance it may seem that applying ridge regression to the covariance matrix should be detrimental to determining the actual values of correlation function parameters: we are effectively assuming by fiat that the effective covariance matrix to be used in calculating χ2 differs from what was measured. Since ridge regression yields larger values for the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix than the data themselves would suggest, the results are equivalent to a situation with larger nominal measurement uncertainties (and hence broader χ2 minima) than implied by the original covariance matrix.

Let us briefly contrast the idea of using antimatter with the synthetic black hole we will discuss below. It is currently possible to produce antimatter in extremely small quantities, while a synthetic black hole would necessarily be very massive. On the other hand, the process of generating a BH from collapse is naturally efficient, so it would require millions of times less energy than a comparable amount of antimatter or at least tens of thousands of times given some optimistic future antimatter generator.

In closing this review, we take a somewhat longer view, and outline several directions which seem (to us, at least) worthy of further study, although we hope that the preceding discussion has already prompted our readers to form similar questions independent of these. Once again, we sound a note of caution: given the rapid progress in the field, it is quite likely that this list of future directions might quite rapidly become dated as new results emerge on various fronts.

Task 3: Data Flow Graph
In the Lagrangian formalism, perturbations are described by the Lagrangian displacement vector ξa. The complete description of a perturbation requires the solution of the perturbed field, Euler and energy conservation equations for the metric perturbation hab and the displacement vector ξa. If one can solve all but one of the above equations, using for example a trial vector ξa, then the remaining equation will not be satisfied. One then has to construct a criterion, which will be used to identify the equilibrium star for which the remaining equation is satisfied.
This situation is as good as identical to the O6 planes in D = 6, with the roles of the F0 and F2 flux now played by the F1 and the F3 fluxes. First one observes that the F5-flux must be projected out (just like the F4 before). The ∂V = 0 equations lead to
Molecular dynamics models usually assume a fixed Gaussian shape for the single particle wave functions. The many-body state is represented by a simple product wave function, with or without antisymmetrization. In this way, though single particle wave functions are supposed to be independent (mean-field approximation), the use of localized wave packets induces many-body correlations both in mean-field propagation and hard two body scattering (collision integral), that is treated stochastically. From the point of view of stochastic mean-field models, the philosophy of molecular dynamics would be to introduce a special kind of fluctuation by stochastically localizing the single particle wave functions.

In the framework of the cloud models this suggests that the cold clouds should be essentially external to the hot Comptonising plasma. Then the radiative cooling is much less efficient and the reflection component may be larger. Variations in the covering factor and the distribution of the clouds may even produce a correlation between R and Γ (as e.g. in the spherical case considered by M01).

We start our presentation by introducing a likelihood framework for time-series data at a single genetic locus. We then demonstrate that the P-value given by the χ2 distribution for the likelihood ratio statistic underestimates the actual false-discovery rate. Next, we introduce two methods to correct this bias, and we verify that they are virtually unbiased for large sample sizes and conservative for small sample sizes. We quantify the power of these two tests for selection in different parameter regimes, considering also noise in the measurements of allele frequencies. Finally, we apply our methods to three experimental data sets and demonstrate that the tests behave as expected in practical situations.

A crucial feature of DDEs is that they need an infinite set of initial conditions to be integrated. This set is usually called history and provides the state of the system before the action of the delayed terms. Sometimes history is set randomly, although given the sensitivity of some systems with delay and the difficulties arising when an infinite set of initial random points is needed, the choice of random histories is a delicate issue. A better option is to set the history as the solution of the system without the delayed terms. Another possibility are history functions described by some parameters and properly chosen for each physical situation.

What we have discussed is only a theoretical framework that exhibits clearly the different sources of stress tensors. To study specifically the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma for example, it will be necessary to investigation the specific nature of different constituents and their interactions in a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, the general roles played by the different components of stress tensors can still be a useful reminder on the importance of the quantum and mean-field stress tensors in the strongly-coupled regime, at temperature just above the transition temperature Tc.

These observations motivates us to investigate the possibility of taking advantage of this performance difference of different systems for a more effective score fusion method. To this goal we investigated training a separate score fusion model for each duration condition, however this method could not give the expected gain in accuracy due to the fact that by splitting the available data for training score fusion, and training multiple models, the effectiveness of these models decrease. However, still some improvement in the overall accuracy of the systems was observed.
The close connection with the two dimensional analysis is now evident. There the starting point was to consider two distinct fermionic theories with opposite chiralities.

The Algebra of Non-Local Charges in Non-Linear Sigma Models
Because in this case the excitation never stops, energy keeps entering the system and the flow never reaches any kind of stationary state, due to its lack of a dissipative mechanism. One sees excitations emerging continuously and vortices seem to appear and disappear at the edges of the cloud. At the same time, one sees localized excitations, where the velocity is large, mostly accumulating at the edges of the cloud. We believe these are acoustic excitations. At the final stages of the video the images hardly allows to discern if there are vortex tangles inside the cloud, since most of the velocity excitations, as mentioned, are accumulated at the borders of the clouds.
The above discussion shows that the interaction between DE and DM can lead to a constant r. Although it is not clear how to obtain a r of O(1) size at early times, this simple strategy can be used to account for particular situations (e.g. late time evolution of the universe). Nevertheless, there is no strong motivation for setting r to be a constant. It is worthwhile to explore some more realistic models in which r varies slowly with time. We discuss this possibility in detail here.

We must be very careful in interpreting this equation. We put the Newtonian force and the new gravitational force side by side simply because we want to emphasize their relative importance in determining the response of the test object at distance r. What this equation really mean is that when the Newtonian force is weak, the space-time metric will be that of Thompson-Pirani-Pavelle, and vice versa.
The starting point in our work are these two contributions. We follow individual phonons in a space divided into cells. The phonons after a drift phase are able to interact and to be scattered. The speed and the rate at which phonons scatter depends on the frequency. We ensure that energy is conserved after each scattering process. This procedure is different whether the phonons interact through a N process or a U process. This paper is therefore an improvement of existing phonon Monte Carlo methods and is validated on simple examples such as a semiconductor film heated at two different temperatures.

In dealing with the evidence ratio for repeated trials, we will thus use the prior twice. The standard Bayesian approach regards the data as being fixed specific numbers, and the prior enters only when we average the likelihood function over the prior to obtain the posterior probabilities. However, when we view the Bayesian outputs as statistics, we have to treat the data as random variables, whose distribution will depend on the values of the parameters for which we have a prior. The probability distribution of the evidence ratio involves the data, and so depends on the unknown parameters that are the argument of the prior. We can eliminate these parameters by a further integration over the prior, in effect, marginalizing the distribution of the evidence ratio to obtain its probability distribution independent of parameters.
The hypothesis that the deep structure of spacetime is a discrete poset characterises causal set theory at the kinematical level; that is, it is a proposition about what substance is the subject of the theory. However, kinematics needs to be completed by dynamics, or rules about how the substance behaves, if one is to have a complete theory.

In this section, we present our results for the phase diagrams of the NJL model with u, d, and s quarks. We plot the phase diagrams as a function of the chemical potentials and temperature. To determine the locations of the phase boundaries, we examine the behavior of the condensates. If a condensate jumps discontinuously the transition is first-order, and this is indicated by a solid line. If its derivative has a discontinuity, the transition is second order, and this is indicated by a dotted line. If a condensate changes rapidly in a narrow range without vanishing there is a smooth cross-over, and this is indicated by a dashed-dotted line at the point were the condensate varies maximally.
Our results support a close association between the radio source and the CME expansion for both events, as shown by the close relation between the type-II-emitting shock segment and the EUV wave, which clearly was produced by the CME.
Two-channel optimal teleportation protocol based on Bell measurements
Using Gaussian diffusion for image filtration has one great drawback: its homogeneity, which leads to unwanted diffusion of image features like edges. The idea behind the Perona-Malik equation is to modify the heat equation by adding the diffusivity coefficient depending on space activity in a given part of a picture, measured by the norm of the local picture gradient. For small gradient norm (homogeneous regions) large values of the diffusivity are expected, to perform stronger smoothing. In regions with big gradient norm (inhomogeneity) smaller diffusivity is expected, to slow down the diffusion process and protect delicate image features. Hence, the precise Perona-Malik problem formulation with a Neumann boundary condition is
Monte Carlo simulations revealed that the selection efficiency is insensitive to the uncertainties in the beam energy spread and the associated systematic error is negligible.

We notice that in the absense of a cosmological constant, we get no diffusion. This makes sense, because in that case the classical trajectories describe a radiation filled universe. Such universe would have no scalar curvature, and so it should be insensitive to the value of ν as well.

The intervals between the angles αn each correspond to a local maximum of the bound state. The effective distance over which the phase drop occurs along the trajectory increases with every additional reflection and the effective phase gradient thus decreases. In the case of the S-N-S model, the substructure of the bound states does not occur because the phase drop occurs in the direct vicinity of the constriction. Reflections of the trajectories do not change the effective distance over which the phase drop occurs along the trajectories.

We expect that the three-way observation time will increase significantly as the exchanged data set will become complete. The ALLEGRO detector has been showing the best duty cycle, close to 100% on the exchanged data period, as well as the most stationary noise performance with respect to the other detectors.

An immediate consequence of this lemma is that, once a broken line begins to move left or down, it will continue to do so. In particular, if γ is a broken line ending in the first quadrant, it can move left (resp. down) only in the first and fourth (resp. second) quadrant.
To fulfil these physics goals, SuperNEMO will build upon the NEMO 3 technology choice of combining calorimetry and tracking. This gives the ability to measure individual electron tracks, vertices, energies and time of flight, and to reconstruct fully the kinematics and topology of an event. Particle identification of gamma and alpha particles, as well as distinguishing electrons from positrons with the help of a magnetic field, form the basis of background rejection. An important feature of NEMO 3 which is kept in SuperNEMO is the fact that the double beta decay source is separate from the detector, allowing several different isotopes to be studied.

Since FGG is determined only by the gun, this leads to an important measure of the quality of the gun that only depends on the output state of the gun. If there is only one suitable target state (i.e., ρT is pure), then we have FTT = 1 and SGT reduces to FGT. This must be less than FGG, and FGG therefore directly limits the suitability of a candidate gun for this class of targets.

From a quantitative point of view, our prediction of a violation of finite-size scaling is difficult to be tested by means of Monte Carlo simulations (e.g., for Ising models) because the non-scaling effect on χ occurs predominantly in the region L ≫ ξ where the total finite-size effects on χ are exponentially small (for periodic boundary conditions).

Concluding remarks
The actual degree of distortion of surface state wave functions in the z direction due to interactions with inner layers requires numerical calculations and is beyond the scope of this paper. Wave function distortion in the z direction, however, does not invalidate group theoretical calculations because z direction distorted wave functions are still basis functions of wallpaper groups. Distortions of wave functions only change the magnitude of coupling constants between surface states and bulk states.
To one chiral loop order, the diagram shown in fig.II (a) gives the correction to the I-W form factor, after properly taking into account wave function renormalization (the latter naturally emerges when explicitly calculating all one loop diagrams for the three-point function).

Absolute flux calibration was determined by observing either 3C286 or 3C48, which are EVLA flux-density standards. The flux density scale is likely accurate to about 5% for X-band, high declination sources, but degrades to 20-30% for Q-band, and especially the low-declination sources. The gain (phase and amplitude) calibration was carried out in the normal manner after initial bandpass and delay calibration were made using the flux-density calibrators. All calibration and imaging steps were performed using natural weighting with the AIPS software package; fluxes were derived from Gaussian fits to the observed intensity maps, using the JMFIT task.

Alternately, we could note that there may be various structures that distinguish various bosons from each other or various fermions from each other. There could be a symmetry group that relates some bosons together but not others. This symmetry group may arise from a higher-dimensional supermultiplet that has been dimensionally reduced to one dimension, for instance. Also, some of these bosons might be treated differently in some symmetry-breaking mechanism such as if these bosons were in an asymmetric external field. The extreme case in these situations is for each boson and each fermion to be treated and labeled differently, which is the situation in the problem we have posed and addressed herein.

Handling Outliers
Figures 7 shows the time evolution of the hardness x calculated using the numerically determined central velocity dispersion (the maximum value anywhere within the system.) The vertical extent of the line segment indicates the range of the hardness implied by the initial binary binding energy distribution. The figure shows that during the period before the phase of maximum contraction, the binaries are hard so, in a thermal distribution, one would expect them to harden, not disrupt. As a result, the early binary destruction (when hardening is expected) is noteworthy. Moreover, after the transition all the binaries are soft and, in a thermal distribution, would tend to become softer. As a result, the binary hardening observed at the end of the simulation for the largest initial binding energies is noteworthy.

For completeness we list here the S-duality rules using the above conventions, however we omit the S-duality relation for C8 since we do not use it in this paper. These relations read as follows,
It is interesting to note that the spectrum does not depend on the magnetic field. Also the dispersion relation is no longer linear as it should be in the presence of interactions. So, we find that it is indeed possible to create bound states with an imaginary vector potential. We shall now demonstrate the above results for a second example.

In this manuscript we report evidence of temporal vectorial DS in a single mode Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) enclosed into a polarization sensitive double external cavity. By exploiting the two different times of flight as well as the polarization selectivity of the cavity, we are able to control the polarization state of light and generate vectorial DS. They consist in time-localized rotations of the emitted polarization orientation, thus leaving the total intensity constant. When the cavity round-trip is much longer than the duration of the vectorial DS, several independent DS and/or DS bound states (molecules) may be hosted in the cavity where they coexist with the background solution (zero DS emission). We show that molecules and independent DS can be discriminated experimentally by analyzing their noise-induced motion.

Preliminary calculations showed that the polaron would be very small at strong coupling, so we first performed searches of the solution for strong coupling parameters on small clusters. We used both the differential algorithm and conjugate gradient algorithm using random starting conditions. This generally produced a few low energy configurations. We then used these configurations as starting conditions for a sweep towards zero coupling strength. We would find the lowest energy configuration for a given λ, and then use that configuration as the starting point for the next lower λ calculation. This avoided getting lost in multi-dimensional phase space. We did other surveys for starting configurations that were not low energy solutions at strong coupling, but in these cases only the trivial solution of a free electron immersed in a lattice of unstretched bonds was found.

Conclusion
Traditionally, detailed modeling of IR radiation involved numerous input quantities, necessitating a large number of calculations to obtain successful fits, and diluting the value of the resulting success. However, as pointed out by RR, the number of relevant parameters can be drastically reduced by employing the scaling properties of the radiative transfer problem. For example, the luminosity of the central source is irrelevant, a fact by and large ignored in modeling astronomical sources.
Let us now concentrate on the case of three bosons (N = 3). The PR(t) in this case is defined as,

The time history of the radio emission is shown in Fig.6c and 6d. The volume-averaged radio emissivity is plotted in Fig.6c. The enhancement of the radio emission by the cloud interaction is once again much more evident in the ring-cloud case and more pronounced than the relativistic electron energy enhancement because magnetic energy increases, which are greater during the cloud encounter, are more important to the radio emission. In general, the radio luminosity is an increasing function of time throughout the interval we have studied.

Thus, despite gauge interactions connecting the strongly coupled matter and weakly coupled fermions over a large hierarchy, it would appear that a high degree of SUSY is accidentally maintained in the light composites, permitting a substantial hierarchy between Λcomp and the mass of light composite scalars. But again, it is interesting that this hierarchy cannot naturally be too large. This is our extension of the mechanism of Partial SUSY. We shall make more quantitative illustrative estimates in Section 7.

These two expressions are equivalent for a single partial wave. In order to determine which is useful, we will have to understand how plane waves are superposed. The properties of superposition are generally assumed as postulates of quantum theory. Here, we will consider them as we develop the formalism. In the meantime, however, to avoid confusion it seems better to use the conventional quantum notation of adjoint, and note that we will need to justify this choice when superposition is described.

The verification of low-energy supersymmetry requires the discovery of the supersymmetric particles. Once superpartners are discovered, it is necessary to test their detailed properties to verify the supersymmetric nature of their interactions. Furthermore, one can explicitly test many of the additional theoretical assumptions of section 3 that were introduced to reduce the supersymmetric parameter freedom.
The concepts of equivalent states and of equivalent automata can also be defined for a QA as follows.

The singular component mentioned above enables us to correctly describe the infrared divergence of the longitudinal susceptibility, the Hugenholtz-Pines relation, as well as the NN identity. In addition, we showed that the non-singular part of the self-energy provides the enhancement of the BEC phase transition temperature Tc (which has been predicted by various methods). The value of the enhancement depends on to what extent we take into account many-body corrections in the non-singular self-energy.

The last deformation comes from the magnetic field. To determine its dimension, it is necessary to backreact it on the other fields and find the subleading behaviour it generates:
The first clear result visible from the light curves is that the variations in the different X-ray bands are all correlated. Indeed, these intensive monitorings with high time resolution and long duration allow detailed measurements of the inter-band cross correlation properties, and in particular to make quantitative estimates of the degree of correlation and of any lags between variations at different X-ray wavelengths. Two cross correlation methods, namely the Discrete Correlation Function (DCF) and Modified Mean Deviation (MMD), are applied. In the following, a positive lag indicates the higher energy X-rays leading the lower energy ones, while negative indicates the opposite.
The exponential and the power-law expansion profiles used in this work set the basis for quantifying the details of nucleosynthesis mechanisms. Their low computational cost allows the monitoring of large-scale and small-scale equilibrium patterns among nuclear reactions in time, which is a powerful tool for identifying microscopic components that affect the composition of the ejecta.

One apparent distinction between the analytic result and Pythia is that the double differential cross section in Pythia vanishes in the region near the line eα = eβ, while it does not in the NLL cross section. We attribute this difference to angular ordering/veto imposed in the Monte Carlo. The line eα = eβ requires that all emissions contributing there are located at θ = R0, the edge of the jet. Such a configuration is exponentially suppressed in a Monte Carlo, but is allowed in our NLL expression for the double differential cross section.

Conselice (2004) suggested that the early build-up phase of galaxy formation, corresponding to z > 3, is dominated by major mergers, the intermediate phase at 1 < z < 2 is dominated by hydrodynamic gas accretion, and the late phase (z < 1) is dominated by minor mergers. He noted that Luminous Diffuse Objects, which are morphologically similar to clump clusters, have bright outer regions with low central light concentrations, and so might be examples of the intermediate phase. The signature for this may be present in the age and mass distributions of the clump and interclump regions, studied here.

Buffering architectures and policies for their efficient management constitute one of the core ingredients of a network architecture. In this work we introduce a new specification language, BASEL, that allows to express virtual buffering architectures and management policies representing a variety of economic models. BASEL does not require the user to implement policies in a high-level language; rather, the entire buffering architecture and its policy are reduced to several comparators and simple functions. We show examples of buffering architectures in BASEL and demonstrate empirically the impact of various settings on performance.
First we define the notion of an influence function. Given an initially active set A that is a subset of V and influence probabilities, the influence function denoted by σ(A) is the expected number of active nodes at the end of the diffusion process. The influence maximization problem is, given a parameter k, a social network graph G, and a model of information diffusion, to find a set of k nodes in G to be activated initially (also known as target set) such that, it will maximize the influence function σ(A).
This result can be summarized as follows: two charges born in the same quantum state, and therefore expected to radiate coherently, will become two independent emitters when traversing an opaque medium, in effect loosing memory of their origin. As a consequence, angular ordering in the parton shower should be partially (or completely) destroyed.

Nonperturbative corrections to infrared safe jet cross sections and event shapes are an important issue in the study of QCD.

In the case of a tomography experiment, it is not enough to fit a single spectrum, but the entire series must be reproduced by a single set of input data. There may be solutions that fit a single spectrum better than the one finally adopted, but the overall result may not be as good as that obtained with a different set. Therefore, a double compromise must be reached, on a set of input parameters that give both acceptable individual fits and on a fair reproduction of the spectral evolution.

Because we use the rewiring method, the degree of every node in the original network exactly remains unchanged. For the topological structure of the original network, there is only small variation induced by manipulating rich-club connections, so we can monitor how the subgraph frequencies are affected by the rich-club property. Furthermore, we can compare the results of the subgraph ratio profile for the original network, the network with rich-club, and the network without rich-club, to make more reliable inference of whether the original network has a rich-club property or not.

As in the strong constraint problem, variational data assimilation (weak 4D-Var) represents this pdf by its mode (a single point) and this approximation is the more applicable, the smaller the Frobenius norm of Σ is. An optimal particle smoother can be constructed for this problem by sampling directly (zero variance weights) the Gaussian conditional pdf. For the same reasons as in the previous section, we can expect an optimal particle smoother to perform well under realistic conditions, but also can expect difficulties if the choice of importance function is poor.

In the simplified version of the model the oscillating wall imparts momentum to the particle. However, it is assumed that it takes a stationary position. So the time interval spent by the particle in the travel between collisions does not depend on the phase of the oscillating wall. The simplified versions are widely studied because they are useful under some aspects. For example, they allow to obtain analytical results that can be extended to the complete versions and, usually, they speed up greatly the simulations when compared to the corresponding complete versions.

Furthermore, rapidly upcoming new spectrographs such as the second generation near-IR VLT instruments XShooter and KMOS, the EMIR spectrograph on the Spanish GRANTECAN telescope and others will provide a huge efficiency gain for spectroscopic follow-up of faint candidate sources, thanks to their increased spectral coverage and multi-object capabilities. Observations at longer wavelengths, e.g. with HERSCHEL, APEX and later ALMA, are also planned to search for possible dust emission in such high-z galaxies and to characterise more completely other populations of faint optical dropout galaxies. Finally the JWST and ELTs will obviously be powerful machines to study the first galaxies. Large territories remain unexplored in the early universe!

As we can see from the discussion so far, so long as the corresponding quadratic BSDE is well-posed, the resulting g-evaluation/expectation should behave very similarly to those with linear growth generators, with almost identical proofs using the properties obtained so far.

Being the inverse of the spectral width of the turbulent power spectrum, the turbulent correlation length is to some extent linked to the turbulent ambipolar diffusion decoupling scale. As was mentioned in the previous section, this is the scale of turbulent energy dissipation that characterizes the upper end (in k-space) of the power spectrum. This spectrum is connected to the dispersion function through a simple Fourier transform

As seen, the NeXSPheRIO code does produce nice results on ridges, if we restrict ourselves to appropriate pT domain for hydrodynamic model application. However, what is the origin of ridges? Since each event in our model presents IC with many high-energy density tubes, one may associate these tubes + transverse expansion with the ridge structure. But, the phenomenon is not so trivial. Moreover, why away-side ridges? By considering mainly the central collisions, we tried to understand the origin of the ridge structure, especially the away-side one.

These subtleties are easily explained in terms of conditional measurements. In a perfect BEC two subsequent measurements of individual particles are completely uncorrelated. The spatial probability distribution for the first particle is determined by the mean-field density, and so is the second. However if all the particles move around in a correlated way, e.g. because the system is bound, a measurement of the first particle will determine the systems center-of-mass with high accuracy. A measurement of a second particle will be close to the center-of-mass, and condensation is lost.

In the case of later injection, i.e., tinj = 3000 s, the D abundance increases via 1H(n, γ)2H, and is not affected by already inefficient D destruction reactions. The resulting D abundance is thus larger than in the best case. The 7Be conversion to 7Li by neutron capture efficiently proceeds. However, the reaction 7Li(p, α)4He is no longer operative. The resulting decrease in the mass-number-seven (7Li+7Be) abundance is, therefore, very small.
At the classical level, these fields are the same,
We now consider the effect of finite temperatures on the calculations. The same physics that is manifest in the symmetry dependent low frequency behavior gives rise to a similar characteristic temperature dependence which can also be used to ascertain the energy gap symmetry.

which is a consequence of the fact that U(1)X lies outside SU(5). The anomalies (XYFYF) and (XXX) are also compensated by the Green-Schwarz mechanism. All the anomaly coefficients which are quadratic in X vanish. Obviously, we have (XXSU(2)) = (XXSU(3)) = 0 and (XXYF) = 0 (as usual, the vector-like Higgs do not contribute). Again, the fact that U(1)X does not lie into SU(5) guarantees (XXY) = 0.

We conclude as follows. The conventional entanglement witness is measurable in a single NMR experiment and by only measuring the spin magnetizations, provided that any required unitary transformation can be applied prior to the measurement. However, the unitary transformation has to be changed in accordance to the choices of z and x and in this sense the new entanglement witness, which we introduced in this contribution is proved to have its favorite advantage.

Conclusion and future directions
One parameter that has interesting implications on our understanding of planetary formation is the relative inclination between the orbital plane of the observed planet and that of the presumed interacting planet for the cases of single KOIs with significant TTVs. Relative inclination can induce a precession of the orbital motion of the observed planet, which can manifest itself in a modulation of the transit duration and depth. Although the focus of the present work is on the TTVs, the catalog, which includes derived TDVs and TPVs, can, in principle, help to identify systems with a relative inclination. Furthermore, stringent upper limits on TDVs and TPVs for systems with detected TTVs can help to constrain the relative inclinations between the planets.
We performed global 3D simulations of disk accretion onto a star with parameters close those of T Tauri star V2129 Oph. The large-scale magnetic field of V2129 Oph is approximated by slightly tilted dipole and octupole magnetic moments with polar fields of 0.35 kG and 1.2 kG respectively. Test simulations for the case of a pure dipole field, smaller magnetospheres and a larger dipolar field component were performed for comparison. Below, we summarize our findings and compare our results with the D07 observations/model:

I. INTRODUCTION
The equilibrium configuration of beta-stable matter is obtained at each total baryon number density nB and temperature T by minimizing the total free energy F with respect to the two-body correlation functions, effective masses and proton abundance np/nB subject to the constraints of equations (2),(3), (9) and (25).
Divide this algebra by a two sided ideal defined by elements of the form:
the second term does not contribute to the total number of levels. As is well known for the chGUE the large n-limit of the first term is a semicircle. In the normalization (4.2) of the distribution of the matrix elements, the average level density does not depend on β (see appendix A). The second term in (6.1) therefore does not contribute to the average level density. From the asymptotic formula for the Laguerre polynomials (see eq. (C.2)), it follows that in the thermodynamic limit (n ≫ 1)

Extracting the fundamental parameters
In the present paper we are aiming at describing soft X-ray absorption and emission processes involving two shells. Hence, we can define the Hilbert space associated to this problem by only considering the electrons involved in these two shells. For a shell determined by the quantum numbers (n, l) and containing k electrons, the dimension of the Hilbert space is:
It is worth noting that the uncertainties of the mixing parameters in other representations cannot be evaluated through error propagation using the uncertainties of the mixing parameters obtained in the conventional representation. This is because the covariances of any two mixing parameters in the conventional representation are not provided. One way to obtain the uncertainties of the mixing parameters in any representation is through global fits of the experimental data using various representations. This will be reported in a separate article.

The transients display no anisotropy when the polarizations are rotated with respect to the sample. At 3.1-eV PPE the transients show no magnetic field dependence, while at 1.55-eV PPE a small reversible increase of magnitude of the 10-ps component was observed in both samples. In the PCMO60/STO sample we observed in addition to the reversible also an irreversible increase during the first application of the magnetic field to the ZFC sample. All optical data on the PCMO60/STO sample reported here were therefore taken after the sample was switched into the state with no observable irreversibility.

We begin by defining our units of prediction (queries and ads) and the mechanism used to select them (auctions). We assume a fixed, existing prediction system provides a raw prediction for each ad; our study will then concern prediction maps, functions that attempt to map these raw predictions to calibrated probabilities. Once this framework is established, we can formally state the questions we study.
First, we recall some related concepts and results in the theory of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.
For example, for a compact simply connected group, t(x) is continuous whenever
Given an obfuscator satisfying the virtual black-box property for a program P (in some sense), and some scheme that is secure when the adversary is given black-box access to P, can it be proved (without additional assumptions) that the scheme remains secure when the adversary is also given access to the obfuscated program O(P)?

In addition to the reduced visibility, the phase of the interferometer fluctuates. If the phase fluctuates on the the time scale of the acquisition time this would further decrease the visibility. However, we find the phase drifts rather slowly, by approximately 0.01 rad in one minute.
The non-shuffling cyclic ordering is the easiest to code and has the cheapest per-iteration cost because shuffling requires pseudo-random number generation, which can be time consuming, especially when each inner iteration step is simple. Shuffling, however, avoids the worst ordering and, depending on the application, can accelerate the convergence.
Coupled quintessence and dark matter
In this work we apply the QRE mechanism to the case of hadrons and, in particular, to the collinear emission of a light meson from a (anti)proton beam. We evaluate the cross section for this process for single as well as multi pion production, where pions can be neutral or charged. Our derivation concerns a kinematical region outside the resonance formation region.

Our main limitation is the difficulty distinguishing between similar roads. When a vehicle stops at an intersection and then accelerates slowly a turn or straight path are both possible, so our algorithm relies upon later features in the speed trace to determine which of the possible routes was correct. At the ends of paths there are simply too few features to make this distinction. At the beginning of paths this may simply cause there to be too many possible paths to sort through. These problems are exacerbated in residential areas, where repeated, similar intersections are common.

We design and evaluate three RCN architectures for action recognition. In the first RCN architecture, GRU-RCN, we apply 5 convolutional GRU-RNNs independently on each convolutional map. Each convolution in the GRU-RCN has zero-padded 3 × 3 convolutions that preserves the spatial dimension of the inputs. The number of channels of each respective GRU-RNN hidden-representations are 64, 128, 256, 256, 512. After the RCN operation we obtain 5 hidden-representations for each time step. We apply average pooling on the hidden-representations of the last time-step to reduce their spatial dimension to 1 × 1, and feed the representations to 5 classifiers, composed by a linear layer with a softmax nonlineary. Each classifier therefore focuses on only 1 hidden-representation extracted from the convolutional map of a specific layer. The classifier outputs are then averaged to get the final decision. A dropout ratio of 0.7 is applied on the input of each classifiers.

In section 3 an analysis of simultaneous dependence of the polarizabilities on the neutron-proton asymmetry and on the density is proposed with a differential equation that constrains these two behaviors of the symmetry energies. In sections 4 and 5 the q-dependence (exchanged momentum between the components of nuclear matter, eg. neutrons and protons) of static generalized polarizabilities at finite temperatures with Skyrme forces is investigated in the limit of symmetric nuclear matter. In the last section results are summarized.

In contrast the requirement of non-zero momentum for Kl3 results in a comparison of a localised source to a three-volume average, and there is much more scope for the stochastic volume average to gain. In this calculation, of course, momentum is injected using partially twisted boundary conditions, and cost of requiring multiple inversions for different momenta must be included. It is certainly possible that, similar to BK, a gauge fixed wall source in combination with partially twisted boundary conditions could result in an even greater improvement than the stochastic wall, by similarly providing an non-approximate volume average at similar cost. This is something we intend to study.

The main production mechanism of 26Al is proton capture on 25 Mg. Astrophysical environments that can produce 26Al include hydrostatic H-burning in the convective cores of massive stars and the H-burning shells of intermediate mass stars, and explosive H burning in novae. The carbon and neon rich shells of massive stars are also a site for 26Al production both statically and explosively. In addition to its production, the fresh 26Al must be transported into the ISM before it decays in order to be observable. The explosive mechanisms present no problems, but the transport timescale in AGB stars is of similar order to the decay timescale causing a reduction in the amount of 26Al released into the ISM.

We utilize the Anderson impurity model to study the Kondo screening of a spin-1/2 magnetic impurity in a 3D Dirac or Weyl semimetal.

The Hamiltonian reads

The TEM images taken as part of this study have strikingly confirmed previous hypotheses about the structure of heterostructures and multilayers grown with the ALL-MBE technique. In particular, the TEM images demonstrate that single layers of 2212 and 2201 can be grown as part of a multilayer. Furthermore, single layers of metastable or unstable phases such as 2278 and 1278 can also be grown. These TEM micrographs provide the first direct evidence for the existence of these phases. While growth flaws like twins, stacking faults and antiphase boundaries do occur, especially in overgrowths on metastable barrier layers, the images are most notable for the long, unbroken continuity of most 2212 planes. Up to this point, ALL-MBE growth of BiSrCaCuO superconductors have not reached the perfection that is observed in MBE growth of GaAs, AlAs and related compounds. However, planned improvements in the ALL-MBE process such as rotation of the substrate during growth may make comparably low defect densities possible.

Optical lattices are periodic potentials for atoms created by the interference of two or more laser fields. In near-resonant optical lattices a set of laser fields produce at once the periodic potential for the atoms and the cooling mechanism, named Sisyphus cooling, which decreases their kinetic energy so that they are finally trapped at the bottom of the potential wells. We describe here the principles of these optical lattices in the case of a one-dimensional configuration and a Jg = 1/2 → Je = 3/2 atomic transition. This is the simplest configuration in which Sisyphus cooling takes place.

It is important to note however that despite the mathematical equivalence between the Raman-Nath approximation and the perturbation method, both approaches are associated with different validity conditions. Indeed, whereas condition (21) applies to the latter, the Raman-Nath approach is associated with equation (24) which can be rewritten using the expression of nmax in the form:
The present paper reviews and extends the existing work on Newtonian covariant hydrodynamics on the one hand, while on the other it applies the covariant techniques to magnetohydrodynamic studies. Exploiting the advantages of the relative-motion treatment, we supplement the standard hydrodynamic formulae with a set of three propagation and three constraint equations that monitor the evolution of the irreducible kinematical variables. The latter, namely the volume expansion/contraction, the shear and the vorticity, describe the relative motion of neighbouring flow lines. The aforementioned formulae are obtained in a manner analogous to that of their relativistic counterparts and this facilitates the direct comparison of the two sets. In fact, the close analogy between the Newtonian and the relativistic equations is maintained throughout the paper and this allows the unambiguous identification of their differences.

Since the average lengthscale in the system is constantly increasing due to coarsening, the scaling for x compresses P laterally to keep the center of mass at unity. However, to make sure that mass (area) is not also reduced, we also perform the scaling shown on P which stretches P vertically, preserving total area, and thus, mass. The unknowns φ and C are formally scaled as well; φ is a velocity, and so receives the same scaling as x, while C is the sum of two distributions, and so receives the same scaling as P.

The wire array, flattening ring, and flexure assembly are each kinematically mounted to a stiff aluminum weldment frame. The entire VPM assembly mounts through three pivot joints on this weldment frame to the rest of the telescope structure allowing for adjustment of the final direction of the telescope pointing. Lightweight paneling encloses the VPM structure - opening only on the mirror side of the VPM - and the temperature of the system is controlled to ensure stable performance of the electronics and the encoders while simultaneously stabilizing the transfer function of the VPM.

We observe a similar phenomenon when training CNNs on the low-quality data. For example, on the CARS dataset, sequential training A,B outperforms the model trained on low-resolution data B, as well as the model trained on the mixture of datasets A + B, when evaluated on the low-resolution data B (48.6% vs. 41.1% vs. 46.8% respectively). Since low-quality data is generally difficult to recognize, introducing them gradually might explain the better performance of the sequential training. Additional benefits of CQD come from the fact that we have paired high- and low-quality images allowing better knowledge transfer through distillation.

This critical boundary condition separates positive and non-positive self-adjoint extensions. We will then exhibit boundary conditions with positive and non-positive spectra on either side of qC.

Spin Hall effect versus Rashba torque
Common WLCG storage technologies such as DPM and CASTOR attempt to decentralise some operations, locating metadata in a central database and distributing data across multiple file servers. Data access is localised to the fileserver to the extent that TURLs provided by SRM access are usually explicit references to services running on the fileserver with the file, not the central management machine. The global state of an SE is still explicitly synchronised via the central bottleneck, however, as all lookups and handoffs must pass through it. Many experiments have explored caching TURLs for individual files in order to optimise their performance, thus attempting to achieve object-store-like mechanics by the backdoor.

We have used the 3-D AMR cosmology code described by Bryan & Norman (1997a), Norman and Bryan (1999), Bryan, Abel and Norman (2001). The AMR algorithm used is similar to the one described by Berger and Collela (1989). It utilizes an adaptive hierarchy of grid patches at various levels of resolution. Each rectangular grid patch covers the region of space in its parent grid needing higher resolution, and may itself become the parent grid to an even higher resolution child grid. Initial and boundary conditions are obtained by interpolation from the parent grid when the child grid is created.

New NA60 results obtained in p-A collisions at 158 and 400 GeV have been presented and compared with the already existing measurements from other fixed target experiments. Cold nuclear matter effects, determined from p-A interactions, exhibit a rather strong energy and kinematical dependence. Therefore the use of the new p-A results at 158A GeV, the same energy as the A-A data, allows a more precise definition of the expected cold nuclear matter effects in nuclear collisions. Apart from very central Pb-Pb collisions, where the anomalous suppression is still sizeable, a smaller effect with respect to previous estimates is observed. Results on J/ψ polar and azimuthal parameters have also been presented for both p-A and A-A collisions.

3.3.2. Impact on disk fragmentation. Stellar irradiation is known to have a profound impact on the gravitational stability of protostellar disks (Stamatellos and Whitworth, 2009ab; Offner et al., 2009, Rice et al., 2011). Flared disks can intercept a notable fraction of the stellar UV and X-ray flux, which first heats dust and then gas via collisions with dust grains. The net effect is an increase in the gas/dust temperature leading to disk stabilization. X-rays can also ionize gas. SPH simulations by Stamatellos et al., (2011, 2012) demonstrate that quiescent periods between the luminosity bursts can be sufficiently long for the disk to cool and fragment. Thus, episodic accretion can enable the formation of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary-mass objects by disk fragmentation, as confirmed by the recent numerical hydrodynamical simulations presented by Vorobyov, (2013).
This relation allows us to check global energy conservation
Our results are given in Tables 5 and 6. Table 5 gives a break-down of the quark-exchange processes into individual contributions. Table 6 sums the results up to the charge radius. The difference in the predictions for models A and B shows that the short-ranged nonlocal attraction due to Figs. 2(b-c) and 2(e-g) indeed leads to some redistribution of matter towards shorter distances which affects already the deuteron matter radius and therefore the impulse approximation to the charge radius. We find that the novel quark-exchange current contributions to the deuteron charge radius amount to about 20% of the traditional π-meson exchange contribution; they are therefore of the same size as the non-pionic exchange current corrections considered in Subsect. 3.1. The e.m. QEC corrections are, however, smaller than the quark exchange effects generating the attractive nonlocality responsible for the redistribution of matter to smaller distances.
and therefore λ̃k tends (very slowly) to zero as k goes to zero. This should be contrasted with equation (3.18b) of the pure scalar theory, where λ̃k tends to a constant. The different behaviour is due to the presence of a massless particle, the graviton.

One of the main differences to the standard model is that we do not assume an inner gap which accelerates particles to ultrarelativistic energies and is saturated by a pair avalanche. Instead we suggest a conducting wire model with a quasi-stationary, low relativistic current that suffers fluctuations on short time scales. Such a model is supported by calculations on particle densities available from the polar cap by thermal and field emission (Jessner et al. 2001) which show that inner gap models have severe difficulties in producing particles energetic enough to start pair cascades for parallel or nearly parallel rotators.

From smaller to larger values of Bo, the points represent runs 53, 6, 19, 54 and 61. At small Bo, SF is inhibited because Bo is small enough not to counteract magnetic braking, but is able to prevent radial collapse of sheared condensations. Intermediate values of Bo counteract magnetic braking and thus promote SF. Very large values of Bo inhibit SF again because the magnetic field rigidifies the medium.

Blazars are active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting a supermassive black hole, with relativistic jets pointing close to the line of sight to the observer. The small viewing angle of the jet makes it possible to observe strong relativistic effects, such as a boosting of the emitted power and shortening of the characteristic time scales. Blazars are typically identified in radio and optical surveys, their defining characteristics being radio loudness, flat spectrum and compact morphology in the radio band, some degree of optical polarization, and fast, large-amplitude variability.

The signatures of strong electroweak symmetry breaking sector discussed so far are WW scattering and are relatively model-independent.

Now we turn our discussions to the model-dependent signatures.

In Section II we consider the basic elements of the Einstein-aether theory supplemented by the pseudoscalar field, and describe the background state possessing the pp-wave symmetry. In Section III we extend the model by adding the test electromagnetic field to the background field. In Section IV we obtain exact solutions for the electric, magnetic and pseudoscalar field. In Section V we discuss the anomalies in the electromagnetic response of the system on the action of the gravitational-pseudoscalar pp-waves. Conclusions are presented in Section VI.
First note that the inequality h0(E1)/r1 ≥ h0(E)/(r + 1) ≥ 2 implies r1 ≤ (g1 + 1)/2.

Infrared spectroscopy and SED modeling suggest that the majority of debris disks possess central clearings. They may be generated by planets that gravitationally eject dust grains that are otherwise spiralling toward their orbit centers under Poynting-Robertson and stellar wind drag. However, a number of other processes may also contribute to presence of absence of central clearings:

As usual, the model has of order LN2 active DOF, when the proper time along the trajectory is N Planck units. We will insist that, as N → ∞, the Hamiltonian approaches that of a 1 + 1 dimensional CFT with central charge of order N2, living on an interval of length N, with a UV cutoff of order 1/N. The density matrix is maximally uncertain so the entropy is of order N2, while the average energy is of order N. Note that in order to use these CFT estimates the interval must be much larger than the UV cutoff. This occurs if L is large, which is an amusing connection between the size of compact dimensions and early universe cosmology. Frankly, I do not know what to make of it.

Holographic approaches, originating in string theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence, have been used recently to analyze models that may be in the same universality class as strongly correlated electrons. Such approaches work in a context of large-N adjoint theories at strong coupling. The adjoint nature of such theories makes the large-N limit intractable. In the strong coupling limit however, the theory can be solved using an appropriate gravitational dual theory in higher space-time dimensions.

1. Introduction
In order to show quark confinement, the condensation of a topological soliton is necessary to occur. This has been actually derived by summing up the topological soliton contributions, provided that the topological soliton is described by the topological field theory. The topological field theory has been derived from the gauge fixing term corresponding to the nonlinear gauge fixing condition, the maximal Abelian gauge. The maximal Abelian gauge implies that the topological soliton in question is nothing but the magnetic monopole current, the four-dimensional version of the magnetic monopole. The result ensures that the quark confinement is realized in the QCD vacuum as a dual superconductor. Furthermore, we have proposed a numerical simulation which is able to confirm the validity of the above reformulation.

At model 1300, two unstable monotonic secular modes were encountered. As the core dominance of the nuclear burning ceased, the strength of the instability diminished. Eventually, the most unstable secular modes merged with other branches into oscillatory modes. Most of them became or remained stable during the early helium shell-burning phase. A discussion of the secular-stability behavior during the core He-burning phase of intermediate-mass stars is postponed to a forthcoming paper.
Let us mention that a related problem appears also when one tries to apply the Pohlmeyer reduction approach to describe such string solutions. Instead of the sinh-Gordon theory plus the standard sine-Gordon theory as found in the AdS2 × S2 case one now ends up with

Enumeration
In the leading order approximation of pQCD, only one Pomeron (dipole) splitting into two Pomerons (dipoles), and two Pomerons (dipoles) merging into one Pomeron (dipole) are considered. All other Pomeron vertices do not appear in the leading log x approximation of pQCD. We therefore restrict ourselves to sum only Pomeron diagrams containing triple Pomeron vertices. We add a caveat, that we neglect the 4IP term (which is needed for s channel unitarity), however, this term is only significant at energies W > 105, which is at the limit of the validity of our model.
In order to fit the experimental measurements, we consider the ratios:

Certain quantum systems in 2 dimensions can support quasiparticles with anyonic and non-abelian statistics. These are experimentally realized in fractional quantum hall (FQH) systems. Specifically, the ν = 5/2 FQH state is conjectured to be in the universality class of the Moore-Read (MR) Pfaffian wavefunction, and it is believed that there is a FQH state at ν = 12/5 described by the k = 3, M = 1 Read-Rezayi (RR) state. Both are non-abelian, and the latter supports universal quantum computation, making its study especially important.

For a given mass of obscuring H i, the absorption line strength is inversely proportional to the velocity width of the line. In the environment of a compact mass, the absorption line-width should vary inversely with the (inner) radius from the AGN, and lines arising from rapidly moving gas near an AGN may be broadened below detectability. Without loss of generality, we consider a model where the ensemble of obscuring gas clouds is supported by random motion against gravitational collapse.

We consider a line of sight from the star that passes through the envelope with p the point of closest approach to the planet.

The optical depth to the observer in the C II resonance line along this line of sight at the apparent limb of the envelope is,
Fully inclusive scattering like DIS measures single parton distributions, with no constraint on the size of the Fock state to which they belong. In exclusive scattering the whole Fock state is required to be compact. There are also intermediate (semi-inclusive) hard processes where the scattering occurs off multiparton subsystems of the hadron, such as qq, gg, etc. The theoretical framework for such processes is still incomplete, but the factorization of hard and soft physics seems plausible. This would allow experimental measurements of the compact subsystems and of the momentum fraction that they carry.
While the quaternion group is well known as an abstract group, as are its actions on objects such as the hypercube and the 3-sphere, to our knowledge no physical object has been made which has as its symmetry group the quaternion group.

When D(s) is a Dirichlet series which converges absolutely and locally uniformly for σ > σ0, has an analytic continuation for σ > σ1, is non-zero for σ > σ2 and satisfies lim σ → ∞D(σ) = 1, we define D(s)α for σ > max(σ1, σ2) and an arbitrary complex number α by exp(αlog D(s)) where we choose the principal value of log D(σ3) for some suitably large σ3 and then define log D(s) by continuous variation from σ3 to s.

The 2011 shower is more like the early appearances of the Andromedids prior to the mid-19th century and this is tied to the relatively slow precession rate of this particular streamlet. In the simulations, the material in the 2011 appearance precesses less than that of the Biela dust complex as a whole. Though we have not investigated the process in detail, we do find that the portion of the dust stream involved is trapped in a 3:5 mean motion resonance with Jupiter which likely accounts for its differential evolution.
The CO Emission from Nuclear Starburst Disks
We demonstrated that it is possible to produce enough 6Li by flare accelerated particles to account for the measured 6Li/7Li in lunar soil that is thought to originate from solar wind implantation. The presence of enriched accelerated particle 3He is essential for the production of sufficient 6Li. We note that the radioactive 26Al in the early solar system is thought to be produced in 3He induced reactions (Lee et al. 1998). This raises the possibility that some of the meteoritic 6Li could also be of local early solar system origin.

The choice of appropriate constituent masses also requires some care. Current quark masses would only be appropriate in a fully perturbative analysis in which classes of diagrams are resummed to avoid singularities associated with particles going on shell. However, traditional constituent masses are not entirely appropriate for this calculation either, as they are typically obtained from static processes, not a dynamical scattering such as photoproduction. The choice of mass parameters, as seen below, lies somewhere in between these extremes.

Some conditions leading to flares may change over a period shorter than 24 hours, but longer than 1 hour. It is reasonable to assume that the effect of these changes may also be detected in the precursor flaring activity during the 24-hour interval before the main flare. The literature on this topic is not too vast, the number of papers dealing with investigation for such an extended time interval is very low.

One prediction of the model, however, does not seem to be verified here: originally, the model aimed to explain the higher specific frequency of ellipticals compared with spiral galaxies. Taking into account the different mass to V luminosity along the Hubble sequence, the specific frequencies of ellipticals are higher by a factor two than in spirals (Ashman & Zepf 1992). If this excess of globular clusters had to be explained by formation during mergers and interactions alone, Ashman & Zepf (1992) expected the formation of as many new globular clusters as there were old ones.

Removed populations Rn, Rnm do not affect dynamics of all others in the framework of the standard SIR model, and we omit them from consideration here.

Note that errors in the knowledge of corrugation profiles lead to respective errors in computed gradient of the Yukawa force. The largest error arises from the error in l1 which is of about 1.3%. This effectively leads to the same error in the interaction strength α. In the logarithmic scale used in Fig. 2 in Sec.

In this method, as opposed to the folding method with a shelving state, only one-way coherent transfer is required, so conventional STIRAP can be used. Another attractive feature of this method is that only one circular light polarization is used, which simplifies the implementation and also avoids the possibility for atoms to be trapped in excited-state dark states, so the STIRAP fields can be tuned on one-photon resonance.

When the difference between the output generated by the neuro-fuzzy computing system and the given training output is larger than the predefined threshold value the system should be trained with the new training data. In fact, the main reason causes the system not to be able to generate an accurate output for the given input data is that it has not been subjected to a similar data before. In this case first we create a new fuzzy min-term by adding a new neuron to hidden layer and then we apply appropriate changes to the synaptic weights stored in the second crossbar to make the final output closer to the output training data.

For definiteness, consider QCD in Feynman gauge, though the discussion of any gauge theory in any covariant gauge will be similar. A system in thermal equilibrium is not in any particular quantum state; all one knows is the probability of it being in any one of a complete set of physical states. That is, one describes the system through a density matrix that expresses the knowledge that it is in thermal equilibrium:

Micro averaged purity and entropy are compared. Micro averaging weights the score of a cluster by its size. Purity and entropy are calculated by comparing the clustering solution to the labels provided. A higher purity score indicates a higher quality solution because the clusters are more pure with respect to the ground truth. A lower entropy score indicates a higher quality solution because there is more order with respect to the ground truth.

The third limitation is due to the key data structure of the learning switch application: the hash table. Existing controllers experience either a locking overhead or a large cache overhead, which increases the time needed to process each individual packet. We observed that NOX, Maestro and Floodlight experienced over 20% of cache misses in accessing the hash table data structure. All three allow packets to be processed out of order and this requires locking. Unfortunately, locks add significant overhead as the number of threads increases.

An invariant amplitude for scattering or decay in which the photon couples to the vector meson contains the ratio gVab/gV which forces the appearance of the same ratio (squared) in the cross section or decay rate. We will discuss two methods for fixing these quantities. For the case of the φ(1020) we can fix these coupling constants independently via strong and electromagnetic decays; whereas for the higher excitations presently considered we are forced to use another procedure. First consider the decay φ → ρπ. We calculate its rate to be

However, we have also seen that the larger systems encountered in large linear-scaling DFT calculations can behave very differently from the small molecules in the test set. In particular, there is scope in large systems for considerable long-range charge redistribution in response to the effect of periodic images, so reliable extrapolation from simulations using a small unit cell are then impossible. In such situations, one has no choice but to use a method that explicitly negates the effect of periodic images.

Dimer separation measurement error
In this letter, we propose a unified model of DE and DM in the context of a cosmic phase transition and further the mechanism for the early formation of non-linear objects. The key feature of DE would be the volume-independent negative pressure, which guarantees the accelerated cosmic expansion through the Einstein equation. The only known matter which shows negative pressure would be some classical coherent objects such as scalar fields. As an origin of such coherent object, we specifically consider the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a boson field with attractive interaction, and we can identify the condensation as DE and the exited bose gas as DM. The pressure of BEC for ideal gas is volume independent and therefore an introduction of attractive interaction would easily yields negative pressure. If we adopt this scenario, the DE dominance means that our universe is in almost the ground state described by a macroscopic wave function. Thus the largest scale of the Universe, as well as the smallest, would turn out to be described by quantum mechanics.

Summing up the result of the calculations of the foregoing section, we have proved
We must assume that they have interacted in such a way as to impart on one another a very weak rotation. By conservation of baryon number we know one will have a rotation corresponding to positive baryon asymmetry and the other will carry negative baryon asymmetry. We now wish to show that this weak rotation is enough to cause the positive perturbation to preferentially accrete baryons as it grows, while the negative perturbation will preferentially accrete anti-baryons. Thus the charge asymmetries will be enhanced, eventually yielding a Q-ball/anti-Q-ball pair.
The procedure is to generate samples with NuWro generator for both experiments and compare the resulting ratio of Monte Carlo cross sections to the experimental one.

It appears then that an accelerator that is similar to the Energy Doubler could be made to be energy productive. Starting from the beginning, perhaps the injector system could be made to use less ertergy and produce higher intensities. One could also optimize the size of the rings so as to reduce the refrigeration requirement and to raise the intensity capability. An important improvement (and one assumed in all the above) would be to make at least two magnet-rings back-to-back so that the electric energy could oscillate from one to the other rather than just being put back into the power mains. This would double the intensity and would make efficient use of the injection system, for one ring could be loaded while the other was accelerating the protons previously loaded into it. My guess is that the optimum energy of the accelerator will be smaller, but this will depend on details of the injection system and on the shape of the real estate that is available. Values of N0 for other energies are given in Table I: they vary roughly inversely with the energy but 100 GeV gives fractionally about 30% more energy per proton than does 1000 GeV.

We can also compare the result without any selection function correction, which illustrates the necessity of correcting for having a non-volume-limited sample. However, WiggleZ contains holes in the angular coverage, which are independent of assumptions about completion, so we must still take these into account. We therefore normalise each Ni(r) measurement by the volume within the selection function included in that sphere. So we calculate:

Overall our results are rather disappointing from a viewpoint of experimental searches for spin-exotic hybrid mesons. We have evaluated two decay channels which combine to give a total width of over 400 MeV. This will make the detailed experimental study of the hybrid meson relatively difficult. There are detailed predictions (such as that the πb1 mode will be dominant) that can be checked, however.
If we understand the amplitudes Z(λ) as result of a relativistic path integral calculation, virtual paths characterized by λ = (λI, λII) are contained in the past light cones of events corresponding to λI and λII, and in the shared past region of both there will be contributions of interaction terms in the action integral. This is the origin of correlation. After both subsystems separate, do not interact, the additional contributions along each individual path will not modify the established correlation, although obviously they can generate individual evolution of each subsystem. That is, all correlation information in Z(λ) has a causal origin in the path integral formalism.

The Qutrit Case
As in Paper I, we assume a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk (Novikov & Thorne 1973; Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), which now may be tilted with respect to the equatorial plane of a spinning BH. Furthermore, we assume that in the high luminosity state (i.e., not the advection dominated state; e.g., Narayan & Yi 1995) the inner disk edge extends to the last stable orbit. Of course, with a central X-ray source, radiation pressure may have effects on the inner disk structure. We will delay the discussion of such effects until the next section.
Our second example concerns the relation between NM and a probabilistic version of NM, which can be constructed according to the following well-known recipe. We consider a phase space probability density ρ(x, p, t) and assume that the total differential of ρ vanishes:
It is convenient to write the differential in an invariant way.

Our new model for SN feedback in SPH cosmological simulations has been divided into two stages: chemical and energy feedback. In this work we address the description of the chemical feedback, which is based on the previous model of Mosconi et al. (2001). In a forthcoming paper, we will present the second part of this work: the implementation of energy feedback in the framework of a multiphase scheme for the ISM, which extends the approach of Marri & White (2003). While a treatment of chemical enrichment without energy feedback is an incomplete picture, we think the complexity of the problem merits a step-wise discussion of our model such that the primary physical effects can be better understood.

In order to be more quantitative and to predict the typical wavelength of the instabilities, the next step of this study will be to consider stabilizing effects coming from line tension, step interactions, and nucleation. As in growth, initial stages of the instability on nominal surfaces, as well as the shape of mounds crucially depend on nucleation. Including this effect is the main challenge for a global understanding of pattern formation via oscillatory driving.

On the Structure of Physical Measures in Gauge Theories
The effect of antikaons in the pressure term is through the meson fields, which change due to the presence of additional antikaon source terms in the equations of motions in Eqs. (11)-(15). In the absence of those source terms for antikaons, we retain the equations of motion for meson fields in the pure hadronic phase.
Finally we introduce one more limiting operator:
(At the time I made this observation, I had forgotten that Iverson originally defined his convention only for single relational operators enclosed in parentheses; I began to put arbitrary logical statements in square brackets, and to assume that this would produce the value 0 or 1.) In this particular case nothing much has been gained when passing from (1.5) to (1.7), although we might be able to make use of identities like
Since for R2 = N the pair (DN, 0) ∈ A × Γ(E) is an exact solution of (1) and (2), we may expect that for R2 close to N the solutions (D, φ) will have D ≈ DN (after a gauge transformation if necessary). We therefore impose D = DN and look for φ ∈ Γ(E) such that:

At variance with the charged asymmetries, difference asymmetries only allow analyses with a lower cut in z if large corrections are taken into account. This fact by no means challenges difference asymmetries.

2. The diffusion coefficient of convective/overshoot mixing shows different behaviors in convection zone and in overshoot region. In the convection zone, the characteristic length scale of the mixing is large, thus the diffusion coefficient is high enough to ensure that the convection zone is completely mixed in most cases. However, in the overshoot region, the characteristic length scale of the mixing is much shorter than in the case of convection zone, thus the diffusion coefficient is much lower. The overshoot mixing should be regarded as a weak mixing process.

As is well known, a background antiferromagnetic ordering does not ensure the minimum energy of charge carriers. That is why the charge carriers tend to destroy the antiferromagnetic ordering and replace it by another ordering or by a disordered state, at least in their vicinity. The destruction can be either static or dynamic (we neglect the translational motion of ferrons or magnetic strings discussed below, as their bandwidths are very small and the Anderson localization should take place in real crystals).

The second ingredient in determining the absolute iron line emission is the geometry of the illumination (Basko 1978; George & Fabian 1991). Consider normally incident photons with energy E > Eth. On average, such photons traverse a distance corresponding to unity optical depth prior to being photoelectrically absorbed. The resulting iron fluorescence photons have to travel through at least the same optical depth of material in order to escape the slab. Some fraction of these iron line photons will be absorbed in this process (either by K-shell photoionization of low-Z metals or L-shell photoionization of iron). Now, consider photons that are incident on the slab with a large inclination (i.e. grazing collision). Again, these photons are absorbed after a unity optical depth, but this now corresponds to a significantly smaller vertical depth in the slab. Thus, the resultant iron line photons can escape significantly less impeded by subsequent absorption. The net result is that the effective fluorescent yield increases with increasing inclination (see Fig. 1 of George & Fabian 1991).
Since there are |K|t elements of Kt, the union bound implies the statement of the lemma.
We now combine these results.
Based on some fresh looks into the quantum mechanical formalism, here we point out a new interpretational discourse of wide-range implications that include both consciousness as well as the issue of free will, e.g., (Conway and Kochen, 2008; Gisin, 2010).
The slow control functions consume very little CPU time, and therefore does not affect the DAQ speed, such that both operations can both be handled by a single PC without interference on the actual performance.
Let τc be the time the overturning flow is in contact with the boundary, before descending/ascending into the interior of the layer. Diffusion of heat through the step over this time sets the thickness δT of the thermal boundary layer:

Obviously there is a lot of freedom in choosing an initial action. It remains to be seen to what extent this freedom allows to derive complex densities of wider physical interest.
We can use this asymmetry to establish a private channel. A simple case is gravitational redshift security. If Alice is inside a gravitational potential well and Bob is outside, the signals from Alice to Bob suffer a redshift (α < 1). Signals from Bob to Alice are blue-shifted (α > 1). Here, Alice ages more slowly than Bob and CBA > CAB.

A fairly bright (mBo = 14.26) spiral galaxy (UGC 12237) is present inside the ASCA error circle: this is the most probable optical counterpart of AX J2254+1146. Subsequent optical spectroscopy has confirmed that UGC 12237 is a Seyfert 2 at z=0.029.
The concept of scale time is perhaps best visualised by considering the Universe to have the topology of a Euclidean 3-sphere, in which spatial position is defined in the usual way by three angles in spherical polar coordinates, and time corresponds to the radius of the sphere. In this model, the concepts of past, present and future do not have any real meaning. Time is merely a coordinate that determines the volume of spacetime currently occupied by a particle or field. This is in contrast to the conventional concept of spacetime embodied in a Lorentz-de Sitter metric, in which time is perceived to flow from a well defined origin in the past towards an infinite future. Scale time, as defined here, is essentially similar to the concept of imaginary time used in some descriptions of Quantum Gravity.

We have shown that the inclusion of randomness permits a natural generalization of the Emch-Radin model to the class l2 of square-summable lattice potentials. The generalized model (as well as the original one, of course) provides one of the very few examples of a random quantum system allowing a rigorous analysis of the dynamics of approach to equilibrium, and, in particular, of the role probability distributions play there.
Now we can discuss the formation of the wall in the realistic field theories, e.g., the electroweak (EW) theory or the grand unified theory (GUT). In the EW theory the heavy particles which contribute to create the wall are the top quarks, the weak bosons Z0, W ± and the Higgs bosons. Approximately we have the wall-formation-constant for the EW wall:
We are interested in the matrix element which defines the weak form factors by

Whereas the SOC has been extensively studied in graphene, this coupling has so far been rather unexplored in graphynes.

Andreon et al. (1997) have made a detailed comparison of the properties of galaxies in the nearby Coma cluster and the distant cluster, Cl 0939+47. They found that the spiral population of these two clusters appears too different in spatial, color and surface brightness distributions to be the same galaxy population observed at two different epochs. The Coma cluster is therefore unlikely to be representative of the end of the evolution path of Cl 0939+47.
In each case we expect WΣ to coincide with the singular locus of the invariant hypersurface. At least we know that it contains this singular locus, just because of the orbit structure.

For example, it is known that LG is positive semi-definite. Moreover, the sum of the entries in each row of LG is zero which implies that zero is an eigenvalue for LG and e, is a corresponding eigenvector. Furthermore, the multiplicity of zero as an eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix is exactly the number of components of the graph. That is, if c(G) denotes the number of components of G, and mA(λ) denotes the multiplicity of λ as an eigenvalue of A, then we have mLG(0) = c(G).

The possibility of getting RA from strong lensing systems is the starting point of our idea. In order to constrain DDR violation, RA from strong lenses will be compared with analogous (although not exactly the same) luminosity distance ratios RL from the SNe Ia.
Due to its engineered photonic band structure, such a cavity array, coupled to quasi-spin wave excitations, can result in much richer quantum coherent phenomena. We show that the quasi-spin waves of charge qubits can controllably affect the engineered photonic band structure so that the modified dispersion relation results in a slow (and even zero) group velocity of photons propagating along the waveguide of coupled line resonators. The spin-wave excitation can also drive a coherent state of photons in the coupled resonator waveguide. Some pumping methods can make a population inversion to produce a laser-like output above the threshold.
Again solving for the metric components we get

In this subsection, mostly for pedagogical purpose, we consider two extreme cases of mass distribution such as the point mass at the center and the homogeneous distribution in the truncated sphere. These cases allow analytic expression of nβ(E, e), and because it is separable in E and e, Nβ(e) can also be obtained except for its normalization. Therefore, these cases are helpful to understand the results for any more realistic cases.

Let the measurement settings on the first and second qubit (i.e., the polarization and path qubit) be given by the following directions:
In order to study top quark properties such as the top quark polarization, induced from the effective t-b-W couplings, we need to reconstruct the top quark by combining the reconstructed W boson with the b-tagged jet. Most of the t-channel single top quark events contain only one b-jet in the final state. Thus, we can use the leading b-tagged jet algorithm to identify the b-jet in the final state, rather than the best-jet algorithm which is more appropriate for the s-channel. We found that the leading b-tagged jet algorithm effectively picks up the correct b-jet in the event. Since this algorithm makes no assumptions about the other particles in the event, we can use it to also determine the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino (pνz) accurately through a top quark mass constraint. Information about the reconstructed final state can be used to explore correlations between different objects in the event. After reconstruction of the top quark event, we study spin correlations in the top quark decay in three different bases: the helicity basis, the spectator basis, and the beamline basis. We find that the degree of top polarization is very large, especially in the helicity and spectator bases. This is true even after event reconstruction because we are able to reconstruct the top quark final state almost perfectly. As one expects, the degree of top polarization is reduced slightly by the O(αs) corrections, both at parton level and after event reconstruction with the loose selection cuts. We also note that using the tq-frame (the rest frame of the reconstructed top quark and spectator jet) in the helicity basis gives almost the same degree of polarization as in the spectator basis.

In this letter, we report on an in-depth timing analysis of RXTE/PCA data over the entire outburst in January 2009, and the discovery of an orbital period of 24.0 d. This solution is supported by the timing of the three large X-ray outbursts seen in history and by the analysis of pulse arrival times of the January 1992 BATSE observations.
To reiterate, the primary role of the lattice is to provide a non-perturbative regulator. Space-time is not really meant to be a crystal; the lattice is a mathematical trick. It provides a minimum wavelength through the lattice spacing a, i.e. a maximum momentum of π/a. Path summations become well defined ordinary integrals. By avoiding the convergence difficulties of perturbation theory, the lattice provides a route towards a rigorous definition of a quantum field theory as a limiting process.

Next we consider the divergences of the one-loop Feynman diagrams generated by Seff of Eq. (9).

That should be done at fixed transverse coordinates.

We note that the FoM improvement due to a small σobs comes from the follow-ups rather than self-calibration. When we lower σobs from 0.5 to 0.2, the fiducial FoM from self-calibration (without follow-ups) barely changes. This result reflects the fact that simply reducing the value of the scatter is not as effective as improving the constraints on the scatter.

Introduction
We also study the causality and stability for a state with nonzero background flow velocity, i.e., in a Lorentz-boosted frame. We find that the divergence of the group velocity is removed. However, depending on the boost velocity the group velocity of either the shear or the sound mode may still exceed the speed of light in a certain range of wavenumbers. Nevertheless, provided that the ratio τπ/Γs fulfills the asymptotic causality condition, we can show that the equations are stable. In contrast to the analysis in the rest frame, however, they become unstable if the asymptotic causality condition is violated. We shall demonstrate that if the asymptotic causality condition is fulfilled, the causality of the theory as a whole is not compromised. In this sense, causality and stability are intimately related.

The SDSS photometry becomes inaccurate due to saturation for very bright point sources (i < 14 mag). Also, as we go to the brighter magnitude, the ratio of bright stars versus quasars satisfying the color selection criteria increases dramatically. As a consequence, the probability of a candidate being a quasar drops rapidly toward the brighter magnitude. Hence, we discarded candidates brighter than i = 14 mag. Through these processes, we selected about a hundred additional candidates for observation in 2005 January. We name these additional candidates group B candidates. Figure 1 shows the color boxes of group B candidates, WD, WD+M pairs, and the stellar locus. Note that the photometric data used in Figure 1 is not corrected for Galactic extinction as in Table 1.

In conclusion, we have shown that a simple form of embedded many-body expansion truncated at 2-body level gives an effective and accurate way of computing the MP2 correlation energy of large water clusters and ice structures with rather modest computational resources. Our calculations on three key ice structures show that MP2 gives a rather accurate account of their cohesive energies and their relative energies. However, the success of MP2 for ice structures is partly due to error cancellation, and a full understanding of their relative energies requires non-additive dispersion as described by CCSD(T). The application of the embedding techniques to a range of other condensed-phase molecular systems appears likely to be both feasible and fruitful.
The main property of canonical transformation consists in conservation of Poisson brackets between dynamical variables involved. This fact proofs automatically in the usual theory (without derivatives of dynamical variables).

Multi-loop Feynman diagrams pose a serious challenge, especially in the massive case where multiple scales arise. Apart from the successes of high-order expansions in α in QED, which provide a stringent test of quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams are also the way in which we understand the most of field theory, since it allows us to quantify it. They form the basis for our understanding of many phenomena, such as asymptotic freedom and gauge invariance. Therefore, we should strive to refine our handling of Feynman diagrams and to extend its context and its applications.
Now then, we may write Γw as follows:

These nuclear structure effects could change the asymmetry A by as much as ten percent. This uncertainty is so large that a quasielastic measurement may not provide useful information on strange quark contributions or radiative corrections (unless these effects can be significantly constrained by future work). We note that a quasielastic measurement from deuterium rather than from a heavier nucleus should not be plagued by these uncertainties. We expect relativistic corrections to be much smaller for deuterium.

Another key ingredient for the complexity of the adaptive HCDG method is the discrete reliability of the error estimator, which is obtained by using the discrete Helmholtz decomposition and the stability of the postprocessing error with respect to the mesh when the product of the stabilization parameter and the mesh size of the initial triangulation was sufficiently small. With two connection operators corresponding to the deflection and the bending moment respectively, we proved the quasi-optimality of the total error under the minimal regularity. Here the total error is defined as the sum of the bending moment error in an energy norm, the data oscillation and the jump residuals of the inter-element bending moment. Then we define a nonlinear approximation class based on the total error. With previous preparations, we exhibit that the adaptive HCDG method generates a decay rate of the total error in terms of the number of degrees of freedom.

The crucial observation that will be exploited for Hamiltonian Cycle construction on OTIS(BF(2m + 1, 2n + 1)) and OTIS(BF(2m + 1, 2k)) is the following:

We now move on to the perturbative bound:
We study the holographic dual of asymmetrically warped space-times, which are asymptotically AdS. The self-tuning of the cosmological constant is reinterpreted as a cancellation of the visible sector stress-energy tensor by the contribution of a hidden CFT, charged under a spontaneously broken global symmetry. The apparent violation of 4D causality due to bulk geodesics is justified by considering that the CFT feels the background metric as smeared out over a length of the order of the AdS radius.

Introduction
This expression shows that ultracold scattering physics is closely related to bound state physics just below the dissociation threshold. However, this simple relationship rapidly breaks down when going further away from resonance, and is therefore not sufficient to interpret three-body recombination in terms of the scattering length.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we study the elementary properties of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on H3; in particular we derive its spectrum and build up from it the related zeta-function. In section 3 we briefly recall how zeta-function can be used in order to regularize the partition function and we derive the regularized expression for the thermodynamic potential. In section 4 we discuss the Bose-Einstein condensation and derive the critical temperatures in both the cases of low and high temperatures. In section 5 we consider in detail the low and high temperature limits and derive the jump of the first derivative of the specific heat. The paper end with some considerations on the results obtained and some suggestions for further developments.

Because the Meissner-Olechowski gravity model does not contain the Riemann tensors, the supersymmetrization of the model is expected to be easy at on-shell condition in a perturbative approach. By the same reason, quantum correction in the naive sense may also be easy to handle in the model. Also, some compactifications and black hole solutions in the Meissner-Olechowski gravity are interesting and worth studying in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. We shall return to these various aspects of the Meissner-Olechowski gravity in future work.

By gauging the baryon symmetry U(1)B of the d = 4 N = 1 SQCD theory and then reducing its SCI we recovered the well known partition function identities required by the Aharony and Giveon-Kutasov dualities for the d = 3 N = 2 SQCD theories with gauge group U(Nc). Similar dualities for the d = 3 N = 2 SQCD theory with gauge group SU(Nc) (in the presence or absence of Chern-Simons interactions) have long been suspected to exist, but a viable proposal has not been proposed so far. The general philosophy of this work suggests the following approach to this problem.

The principle of finiteness of information is also a matter of controversy. Indeed, how can one verify that a quantum system must essentially have a finite information content? Many people may still be interested to know why we should have such a constraint about the possible measurement results. As many people, for example, are still curious to know why the thermodynamic systems inherently tend to go towards most probable states according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Since, one may someday discover a thermodynamic force which will explain the underlying reason of this tendency.
Thus, now noting explicitly the time-dependence of the various terms, we obtain

For any two objects C and D of C, the collection of all arrows from C to D is called the hom-set and is denoted by HomC(C, D).

We will always work with either small or locally small categories.

We have studied the combined effect of disorder and correlations in a system of 1d lattice fermions using a leading-order functional renormalization group scheme. We computed the conductance in presence of adiabatic coupling to leads on all length and temperature scales. At low energies and for weak disorder, one observes several Luttinger liquid power laws whose exponents are in good agreement with predictions obtained via field theory. The interplay of isolated impurities and disorder is governed by a universal single parameter scaling form.

Higher resolution X-ray data from Chandra were analyzed by Ogrean et al. (2014). Their investigation of the surface brightness profile does not provide any evidence of a shock near the northern relic in agreement with their previous study with XMM-Newton (Ogrean et al. 2013). Instead, Ogrean et al. (2014) report that multiple density discontinuities are present in other regions both on and off the hypothesized merger axis, speculating that the X-ray shock features arise, if real, from violent relaxation of the dark matter cores of the clusters. The presence of the large temperature discontinuity of Akamatsu & Kawahara (2013) was confirmed by the reanalysis of the Suzaku data by Ogrean et al. (2014).

Summary and Conclusions
where
In conclusion we would like to stress that we have constructed a model relaxing the requirement of Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian of the theory which is equivalent to the reality of the classical Lagrangian. This relaxation, however, does not imply the breakdown of Lorentz and CPT invariance. For our classical solutions, expressed in terms of real fields, observable quantities like energy density, pressure, Hubble variable turn out to be real. As a consequence our model describes in a rather natural way the transition from normal matter to phantom one.

At least some ellipticals are supposed to have formed by mergers or interactions. When the majority of these events happened is still unclear, as well as the evolutionary state of the progenitors (still gaseous proto-galaxies or evolved stellar systems?, see e.g. White (1994) for a review).
This allows us to formulate the following theorem.
As the parton distributions and the fragmentation functions, fracture functions are non-pertubative objects that have to be extracted from semi-inclusive high precision experiments. This task is not possible yet, however one can estimate the size of the target fragmentation corrections effects using a sensible model for fracture functions based on parton model ideas.

We consider nine types of queries. First, the queries are classified into three search condition types: single-keyword, multiple-keyword, and limited search queries. For each of the three search condition types, we further consider three types of top-k queries, where k = 10, 50, and 1,000. The performance of the master CPUs, master memory bus, and network hubs depend only on the k value while the performance of the components in slaves depends on both the search condition type and the k value.
It is not hard to see that this amounts to encrypting the message using single DES in CBC mode, but using 2-key triple DES on the final block; the MACM is then simply the encryption of the final block. This suggests that the van Oorschot-Wiener attack may be relevant (and it is!).
We need the following properties of this law.
Proof of Theorem B. From the comments in the introduction it is enough to prove the existence of infinitely many essential parts of symmetric figure eight orbits. The fact that these orbits are imbeddings follows from the results in appendix A. We will first prove the existence of one essential part of a symmetric figure eight orbit, and at the end of the section we indicate how to obtain infinitely many symmetric figure eight orbits.

In this section we describe briefly the coexisting-phases (CP) method to study the non-homogeneous phase of nuclear matter with a fixed proton fraction. The basic idea is that matter can be organized into separated regions of higher and lower density, and the geometry of these regions is assumed to be very simple: a lattice of spherical droplets (bubbles), a plan of cylindrical rods (tubes) or an alternating sequence of slabs. The interface between regions is sharp, and it is taken into account by a surface term and a Coulomb one in the energy density. In the spirit of this approach, a single geometry will be the physical one for some given conditions (temperature, density and proton fraction).
Validity criteria for the linear approximation
in particular κ is 2/3 in one dimension, with almost perfect agreement with the numerical results reported in I. Moreover our result for a well mixed system (zero dimensions) is indeed κ = 1/2, again with perfect agreement with the known results in that case.

The REIM is realized in dilute, anisotropic insulating antiferromagnets when the site dilution does not result in strongly frustrated bonds (that would lead to spin-glass behavior).

The notion of material point is a basic tool in Mathematical Physics since the times of Euler, who introduced it. Even if material points (probably) do not exist, nevertheless they are very useful in the description of nature and they simplify the models so that they can be treated by mathematical tools. However, as new notions entered in Physics (such as the notion of field), the use of material points led to situations which required new mathematics. For example, in order to describe the electric field generated by a charged point we need the notion of Dirac measure δq, namely this field satisfies the following equation:

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II we briefly review the CI formalism, and highlight steps important for its application to the time-dependent problem. In Section III we apply this method to study the quench dynamics of Anderson impurity problem. The relaxation behavior is analyzed based on the many-body energy spectrum, from which the emergent energy scales are identified and numerically tested. A conclusion is given in Section IV. In the Appendix we provide details of the time-dependent CI formalism, including the comparison between different CI truncation schemes.

The experimental study of quantum mechanical systems has made huge progress recently motivated by quantum information science. Producing and manipulating many-body quantum mechanical systems have been relatively easier over the last decade. One of the most essential goals in such experiments is to reconstruct quantum states via quantum state tomography (QST). The QST is an experimental process where the system is repeatedly measured with different elements of a positive operator valued measure (POVM).

Numerical solutions to partial differential equations always require discretization of the problem. This means that instead of continuous space and time dimensions we consider a discrete set of points. The computational domain is subdivided into individual volume elements surrounding node points on a grid or unstructured mesh. Finite volume methods are procedures for representing and evaluating partial differential equations as algebraic equations. They play a key role in computational fluid dynamics. Similar to finite difference schemes, values are calculated at discrete places on a meshed geometry. Volume integrals that contain a divergence term are converted to surface integrals, using the divergence theorem. These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each volume element. Because the flux entering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods are conservative. Finite volume methods have been in the focus of applied mathematics for decades. They have well defined convergence properties and available code packages have reached a very high degree of maturity and reliability.

In the following sections we provide details of the physical model we adopt, and the numerical scheme used to undertake the simulations. The basic model consists of a few tens of protoplanets, embedded in a swarm of thousands of planetesimals, embedded in a gaseous protoplanetary disc, all orbiting around a solar mass star.

The other point of view is that the cutoff is a mathematical means to an end, which is a limiting theory with the cutoff removed. At the intermediate stage a violation of energy-pressure balance may be tolerated, so long as the final theory is physically acceptable. As you both remarked, an unphysical regularization can necessitate unphysical counterterms, so that the undesirable terms appear in the final equations with coefficient 0 (i.e., not at all). I could live with that, but it is certainly highly unaesthetic.

In conclusion, we have studied skyrmion excitations at ν = 1 using finite size calculation. The low energy excitations consist of states with L = S which is shown to be the quantum manifestation of the classical skyrmion state. We also performed the energy gap calculation as a function of Zeeman energy and found kinks in the energy gap associated with the shrinking of the skyrmion size.

What would happen if we change our assumption on the cosmological principle? This fundamentally important problem has not been pursued much, due to the mathematical difficulty in handling nonlinear processes. Not having alternatives due to practical difficulties in research does not guarantee that the presently available explanation should be correct. Scientific cosmology has the Universe as an external reality to compare. If the Universe looks simple in the standard model, is it due to its intrinsic nature or to our simplifying assumptions?

Physics is the empirical science concerned with the behaviour of inanimate matter. The term empirical science refers to the fact that physics relies solely in the ability to test claims about the world with an experiment. Nevertheless, physics is a word and therefore has different meanings depending the use of it in different contexts. For example, we can also describe physics to be what physicist do. Before getting into a loop and describe a physicist as someone who does physics, we can define a physicist as those members of society which work in physics departments and receive funding to do physics. In this context, physics is defined as anything this group of people do. These two meanings are interwoven but they are not equivalent. Our first definition describes an activity, the second one describes an activity done by certain people.

K=2. Here, we only have the third generation Yukawa coupling at tree level. This case is more interesting. We shall find that, although it is possible to generate two Yukawa eigenvalues radiatively, strong constraints from FCNC force the ratio of the (radiatively generated) first to second generation Yukawa couplings to a value too small to be compatible with experiment.

There is nothing new in this behaviour, which is just a consequence of the decrease in time of the closing probability, but it is the origin of other interesting features of the quenched system. In a next subsection we shall try to give an interpretation to this funny result, which is in contrast with the annealed approximation.
In SK14 we have argued that, as long as the initial time is chosen to be early enough, the choice of the value of fn that the initial time does not affect the final value of fnth. In the inner region of the cluster, this is because the short turbulence dissipation time drives fnth quickly to its limiting value determined by the ratio of td and the cluster mass growth time-scale (see Sect. 3.2 of SK14). In the cluster outskirts, the turbulence pressure does accumulate throughout time, but the growth is significant after the region enters the virial radius of the cluster, which occurs only at late times.
The equations for the timelike evolution are given by

For the fully centralized structure, the performance of C-RANs is clearly constrained by the fronthaul link capacity. In the uplink, for instance, RRHs need to sample, quantize, and then forward the received RF signals to the BBU pool. With densely deployed RRHs, the fronthaul traffic generated from a single UE with several MHz bandwidth could be easily scaled up to multiple gigabits per second (Gbps). In practice, a commercial fiber link with tens of GHz capacity could thus be easily overwhelmed even under moderate mobile traffic. One approach to this problem is to utilize the partially centralization structure though substantial signal processing capabilities are required on RRHs; the other alternative is to adopt advanced techniques to optimize the performance under a fully centralized structure with constrained fronthaul. To simplify functions and capabilities of RRHs, the latter solution is the focus of this article, and the corresponding key techniques are surveyed.

String theory models are our only rigorously established models of quantum gravity, but none of the known models apply to the real world. They do not incorporate cosmology, and they do not explain the breaking of supersymmetry (SUSY) that we observe. The theory of Holographic Space-Time is an attempt to generalize string theory in order to resolve these problems. Its basic premise is a strong form of the holographic principle, formulated by myself and W. Fischler:

Currently all these methods yield a single mean value of αp over the whole active region. This is because the low S/N ratio of vector magnetograph measurements inhibits a reliable study of current helicity distribution across the plage; for the same reason, usually only pixels with relatively high field strength (B > 100 G or so) are used in the determination. It is to be hoped that future improvements in magnetograph sensibility will remedy this situation.

How does a protein sequence determine its structure? This question is known as the protein folding problem. Currently, this is an open problem in structural biology. The underlying assumption of the protein folding problem is that the native folded state is encoded in the amino-acid sequence.

A subvariety Y of an abelian variety is translate if it is the union of translates of algebraic subgroups. We also say that a subvariety Y ⊆ A is torsion if it is the union of components of algebraic subgroups. An irreducible Y is called transverse (resp. weak-transverse) if it is not contained in any proper translate (resp. in any proper torsion variety).

It is worth noticing that all the above models such as dark energy, f(R)-gravity and f(T)-gravity have shown to be, in broad sense, in agreement with observational data. As a consequence, unless higher precision probes of the expansion rate and the growth of structure will be available, these rival approaches could not be discriminated. This degeneration about the theoretical background suggests that a more conservative approach to the problem of cosmic acceleration, relying on as less model dependent quantities as possible, is welcome.

The HAWAII-1 PACE array is controlled by an ARC Gen III array controller (also known as Leach Controller or SDSU Controller) from Astronomical Research Cameras, Inc. (ARC), San Diego, USA. The array is mounted on a Fanout Board inside the cryostat. The image data is sent to the ARC-46: 8-Channel IR Video Processor in the array controller box mounted at the side of TIRSPEC cryostat where it is amplified and digitized. The ARC-32 CCD and IR Clock Driver Board provides the clocks to the array and the controller boards. The ARC-22: 250 MHz Fiber Optic Timing Board, Gen III generates the waveforms as well as communicates with a PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) interface board, the ARC-64: 250 MHz PCI Interface board, Gen III mounted in the TIRSPEC control computer, via a duplex fiber optic cable link which transfers data and commands between the computer and the array controller box. The cryostat and array temperatures are monitored using a Lakeshore temperature controller Model 335.

Cosmic rays do reach us with energies exceeding 100 EeV. This presents us with three options: i) the protons are accelerated in nearby sources, ii) they do reach us from distant sources which accelerate them to even higher energies than we observe, thus exacerbating the acceleration problem, or iii) the highest energy cosmic rays are not protons.

Summary and Conclusions
Elastic-Raman-vertex approximation
We have presented an approach that can be used to generate minimal cut sets automatically from a fault-injected model and a general safety requirement. The approach takes advantage of novel features of a new model checker, BT Analyser. In particular, the approach uses the incremental analysis capability of BT Analyser, directed counterexample path generation, cycle constraints and global constraints. The use of these features significantly reduces the computation time required when compared to the traditional way of using model checkers.

Of course, we should remind ourselves that, in our ordinary-matter world, those quarks can aggregate in no time, to hadrons, including nuclei, and the electrons serve to neutralize the charges also in no time. Then atoms, molecules, complex molecules, and so on. These serve as the seeds for the clusters, and then stars, and then galaxies, maybe in a time span of 1 Gyr (i.e., the age of our young Universe). The aggregation caused by strong and electromagnetic forces is fast enough to help giving rise to galaxies in a time span of 1 Gyr. On the other hand, the seeded clusterings might proceed with abundance of extra-heavy dark-matter particles such as familons and family Higgs, all greater than a few TeV and with relatively long lifetimes (owing to very limited decay channels). So, further simulations on galactic formation and evolution may yield clues on our problem.

Meanwhile, if the cosmological principle is even approximately true, there must be a reason for the fact. Inflation provides a possibility that the region within our present horizon has originated from inside the horizon before the early acceleration phase, thus opening a possibility that the cosmological principle can be achieved through a causal mechanism. However, inflation has not provided the actual mechanism for that achievement. Although a class of homogeneous but anisotropic models is known to be driven to an isotropic model through acceleration, the general mechanism is not known yet. Why is the Universe spatially homogeneous and isotropic? This may deserve to be one of the important theoretical problems in scientific cosmology.

On the other hand, the results of the BRL approach compare well with lattice, especially when employing the dressed three-gluon vertex. Since there are considerable error margins present in both the continuum and lattice investigations, stronger statements about the agreement of our methods will have to wait for more refined calculations.
There are a number of other advantages that the normal form approach brings to the table. The approximating equations to the original system are obtained by examining a collection of algebraic conditions. This procedure can be formulated in an algorithmic form and automated, which is of particular importance when approximations of higher order in the small parameter are needed. Computer codes for determining normal forms to any order already exist for some problems in celestial mechanics.

The angular clustering estimate for these 724 sources is shown in the top left panel of Fig. 4a, along with the two-parameter fit to this estimate. We see that the z < 0.3 angular clustering signal is fairly low for the two-parameter fit, with a large uncertainty on the clustering amplitude (see Table 1): the dilution of any intrinsic clustering signal due to the long line-of-sight (of order 30 times the width of the lightcone) is apparently too severe. If we fix the slope at δ = 0.8 (as shown in Fig. 4b), we find a more significant one-parameter fit for the amplitude, although the uncertainty is still considerable.

Using two complementary RG methods, we have provided a comprehensive study of the relaxation dynamics in the Ohmic SBM. The SBM is considered to be the prototype model for a microscopic description of dissipation in open quantum systems. We exploit the mapping of the SBM onto the IRLM. We have studied two basic protocols: a relaxation protocol in which at time t = 0 the system is prepared in a product state and the time evolution is performed with the SBM Hamiltonian as well as a quench protocol in which in addition at time tq > 0 a parameter of the Hamiltonian is abruptly changed. While the FRG was used earlier to study quenches in locally correlated quantum systems we here extended the RTRG to this type of nonequilibrium setup. A comparison of the results obtained using our two approximate methods shows that both provide controlled access to the dynamics of the SBM close to the coherent-to-incoherent transition. In the limit of exponentially large times of the relaxation protocol a comparison to established results derived by other approaches is possible and further substantiates this. Crucially, we present new results for intermediate to long times providing a profound understanding of the details of the relaxation dynamics in all time regimes of interest, in particular those relevant for discussing the crossover from coherent to incoherent behavior.
We can reconcile this apparent discrepancy by noting that the cause of the instability of Q-balls with a large energy per net baryon is quantum mechanical decay. Such decay is not treated in numerical simulations of the classical field. Thus, our estimates would lead us to conclude that unless some way of damping out the ellipticity of a partially-charged AD condensate is present, we must question whether such condensates will truly form Q-balls.

In our tests we assume the observations span approximately one complete solar activity cycle, and so we therefore use fitting models based on the cosinusoidal model. A cosinusoidal variation is of course not an ideal match to the real observed time variation of the solar activity cycle; however, our point here is to test the principle of the technique. We begin with tests on artificial data that do have an underlying variation of the frequencies that is cosinusoidal in time. We then apply the technique to real low-l time series, which have lengths spanning approximately one 11-yr solar activity cycle.

We stress that all the comparisons that we present in this paper have been performed between EOB and Teukolsky waveforms produced with the same EOB trajectory. For example, in order to recalibrate the EOB model, we start with a reasonable EOB trajectory, we feed that to the Teukolsky code, and compare the resulting Teukolsky waveforms to the EOB waveforms. If the waveforms do not agree, we modify the EOB trajectory so that the EOB waveforms agree with the Teukolsky waveforms produced with the old EOB trajectory, and then feed the new EOB trajectory to the Teukolsky code. We then iterate until this procedure has converged.

On these grounds, in the framework of our model we move to infer a general, phenomenological scaling law that connects microscopic scales to the global dimensions of a typical galaxy, thus providing the rationale to bridge the gap between the small numbers of quantum mechanics and the large numbers of cosmology.
Careful analysis revealed that 16 detected sources are known water masers. The H2O line was within the recorded bandwidth. We made a trial fringe search using only one frequency channel which included the water maser line. The fringe amplitude decreased by factor of 4 for continuum sources and increased by the same factor for maser sources.
On the other hand, interstellar travel does not necessarily require large accelerations. Small accelerations sustained over long periods of time suffice.
In case I, a = 1, and if m > 0, then Ax is positive. This implies that in order to keep the observer comoving with the wall it has to accelerate away from the symmetry plane or in other words it is attracted towards the wall. Similarly if m < 0, then the wall exhibites a repulsive nature to the observer. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the domain wall solutions of case II (ii).
We now sort the φ(x, y) values from largest to smallest. The sorted list gives us an implicit representation for S(P/i) for every i ≥ τ. Indeed, it suffices to binary search for the first occurrence of i; the elements to the left correspond to primitive points which are inside P/i.

For many of these outflow features, we cannot clearly identify a counterflow lobe. This is likely due to confusion of the more compact outflows in the central region. For this reason, in this paper we will focus on the properties of the unconfused outflows as well as on the global outflow properties. Interferometry will be important for disentangling these compact outflows, identifying their driving sources, and provide a better estimate of their energetics.

Round Complexity
The dark matter data used for this analysis were accumulated over a period of 13 months between February 28, 2011 and March 31, 2012. Besides 3 interruptions due to equipment maintenance, the data were acquired continuously. Dark matter data taking was otherwise only interrupted by regular calibrations using blue LED light (for the PMT response), a 137Cs source (for monitoring of the LXe purity), and 60Co and 232Th sources (for ER background calibration). Overall, the duty cycle of XENON100 during this dark matter run was 81%. To calibrate the response to NRs, data from an 241 AmBe neutron source were taken just before the start and right after the end of the run. The two measurements are in good agreement.

Throughout we will not explicitly discuss the Hamiltonian for the straight parts of the U-channel since they are relatively trivial and well known.

We emphasize that we are not claiming that asymptotic super-Poincare invariance follows automatically, as time translation invariance did, for any choice of the gk above. Rather, the density matrix constraints of HST imply that the gk(N) must be chosen, for large N, in such a way that the S-matrix is super-Poincare invariant. We have not proven that this is possible, but since the class of Hamiltonians we study contains many free parameters for large N, we believe that it is plausible.

Algebraically, we proceed by starting with the continuous description of a quantity, and discretize into patches to introduce the finite correlation length. We then return to the continuous description, since the analytical manipulations are most easily done in this representation. To finally establish contact with the simulation data, we discretize again applying the scheme used in the hydrodynamical model.

A comparison of RZ05 data with the present model (Fig. 19) indicates that majority of the observed data is fairly explained by the MS population, however some of the observations follow the whole cluster model.

Finally, we combine (24),and Lemma 4.3 to conclude that

One problem we had to face was that of gauge invariance. Unlike QED, where the charge renormalization was trivially gauge invariant (because the photon is neutral), the renormalization constants in QCD were all gauge dependent. However the physics could not depend on the gauge. Another issue was the choice of regularization. Dimensional regularization had not really been developed yet, and we had to convince ourselves that the one-loop β-function was insensitive to the regularization used. We did the calculation in an arbitrary gauge. Since we knew that the answer had to be gauge invariant, we could use gauge invariance as a check on our arithmetic. This was good since we both kept on making mistakes. In February the pace picked up, and we completed the calculation in a spurt of activity. At one point a sign error in one term convinced us that the theory was, as expected, non-asymptotically free. As I sat down to put it all together and to write up our results, I caught the error. At almost the same time Politzer finished his calculation and we compared, through Sidney, our results. The agreement was satisfying.
We have thus improved the limit obtained by Ramberg and Snow by a factor about 40.
Introduction
After a decade of intensive study, our understanding of exclusive double charmonium production has gradually matured. The most notable lesson is perhaps that, the NRQCD factorization approach has proved to be a successful and indispensable tool in dealing with hard exclusive reactions involving heavy quarkonium. However, in our opinion, this research area is still far from being closed, and there remain some important questions to be answered. In the following, we enumerate two topics which may urgently beg for the exploration.
The basic CCD reductions (bias-subtraction, dark-correction, flat-fielding) were carried out within standard IRAF V2.12.2 routines. For all frames we have applied a point-spread-function fitting within the IRAF task DAOPHOT (Stetson 1987). Photometry of each frame was performed separately and the measurements were then averaged and weighted by their individual photometric error.

Numerical modeling of type II critical collapse of relativistic fluids even in spherical symmetry is a rather challenging task. The reason is that the dynamics takes place at ever decreasing spatial length scale and also the density and pressure of the fluid increase by many orders of magnitude. For example, in our calculations the density and pressure increase typically by a factor of million for the nearly critical solutions (in the subcritical regime) and in some of the supercritical calculations the central density reached a value greater than 1054. It is clear that some kind of adaptivity is required in order to perform these calculations.

In this paper, such an assumption is relaxed.

Most of the modifications of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian involve a change in the geometric part of the action only, and assume that the matter Lagrangian plays a subordinate and passive role, which is implemented by the minimal coupling of matter to geometry. However, a general theoretical principle forbidding an arbitrary coupling between matter and geometry does not exist a priori. If theoretical models, in which matter is considered on an equal footing with geometry, are allowed, gravitational theories with many interesting and novel features can be constructed.

Next, we calculate the conditional distance distribution along a given line of sight, which is the probability per unit distance under the assumption that the source is in a given direction. We will use the same sky position as in the example above. We lay out a grid in distance along that line of sight:

Abstract
After removing particles used in the Btag reconstruction, we require that an event have only one charged track, that its charge be opposite that of the Btag and that its laboratory-frame momentum exceed 1.0 GeV/c. This charged track is required to satisfy |dz| < 2.0 cm and dr < 0.5 cm, where |dz| and dr are the distances of closest approach to the interaction point along and perpendicular to the beam axis.

At each subsequent time, the original input is copied on the next line (moving up), and a new simulation of A is started on that line with the mark on the next position (moving right). At time t = n, the first line has simulated n steps of A with a mark on the first cell, while the n-th line starts a new simulation with the mark on the last cell.

We consider the densities of spin and OAM operators in the representation of spherical (multipole) photons (integrands in (2) and (3)). We show that these operators have the same structure in terms of photon operators but different spatial dependence at short and intermediate distances. In the wave (far) zone, this difference vanishes, so that there is no way to distinguish between the spin and OAM parts of the total AM of a multipole photon. Besides that, we consider generation of photon twins entangled with respect to the total angular momentum.

Closing remarks
Rapidly evolving genomic technologies are providing biologically informative data of unprecedented volume, velocity, and variety, with the potential to yield new insights into the processes driving disease. This data has allowed us to develop a more unified understanding of how many different types of interactions at multiple and vastly different scales can influence biological systems. We now appreciate that changes in cellular states involve simultaneous alterations to the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome of the cell. These are often characterized by complex networks whose structures are altered as the phenotype changes. The generation of Big Data in this area now presents an unprecedented opportunity to develop scalable methods capable of modeling these networks, informing us about the nature of disease and ultimately allowing us to hypothesize about the therapeutic approaches most appropriate for each disease state.

A secondary objection is philosophical in nature. Bayesians prefer to treat the true value of the parameter as a random variable, with the experimental data as the fixed and unchanging measure of reality. The parameter then has some probability of falling within the confidence region. The traditional approach treats the true value of the parameter as fixed and unchanging, and the data as only one possible outcome in an imagined ensemble, a shadow or projection of the true reality. The confidence region that we calculate from this instantiation of the data then has some probability of covering the true value of the parameter.

How does stellar evolution impact dynamical evolution? Stellar evolution and dynamical evolution cannot be separated from one another. Stellar evolution causes mass loss from a cluster which alters the mass and energy of the cluster. In responding to this clusters will expand, which will increase their crossing times, and hence their relaxation times.

In conclusion, the long-range correlation present in this sample are quite in agreement with the results of the analysis of CfA1 (CP92), Perseus-Pisces (SL96, Guzzo et al., 1992), CfA2 (Park et al., 1994, Sylos Labini & Amendola, 1995) and finally in the deep ESP survey (Pietronero & Sylos Labini, 1995), and confirm the evidence of fractal behaviour up to the largest observed scales.
The paper is organized as follows. The next section contains a brief introduction to the formalism of thermofield dynamics for spatially inhomogeneous systems. In section 3 we derive expressions for the two-boson correlation function in non-equilibrium states as well as its local equilibrium approximation. Section 4 contains a study of the effect that is exerted on the correlation function by a nonzero spectral width, section 5 contains an example with semi-realistic pion spectral function in hot nuclear matter. Finally we draw some conclusions and discuss the experimental relevance.

Figure 1 demonstrates some of the requirements necessary for the construction of an exact confidence region: 1. The sample space must be continuous.

The parameter space has to be continuous.

Finally we note that the analysis of this Section did not make explicit use of periodic boundary conditions except that the renormalizability in terms of bulk Z factors was assumed according to (58). Therefore our line of thoughts should remain applicable more generally to those cases where the bulk renormalizations suffice to renormalize the physical quantities of the confined system. Our analysis should also be extended to the important case where additional (surface) renormalizations come into play which, for confined systems, have been studied so far only in the continuum approximation (54) (with surface terms) and only in the limit Λ → ∞.

This work is organized as follow. In Section II, we review the basic features of the quantum two-stream instability, and of the electric field energy density in a weakly dissipative dielectric medium. In Section III, fast and slow approximate waves in two-stream quantum plasmas are identified. The coupling of these waves is then analyzed in detail, in order to understand why some wave-numbers are stable and others are not, when varying the strength of quantum effects. A detailed account on the limitations of the quantum two-stream model for large quantum parameters H due to the neglect of collisions is included in Section IV. Section V is reserved to the conclusions.

As in Section 2, one can use these maps to restrict T-polarized functions on this grid. Note that the restricted functions vanish on the south-west boundary of this grid. So, we actually deal with the functions on the grid of size n × n.

We saw before that the basic problem with the naive approach to defining the language generated by a TLR grammar is that the derivation of the string on the symbol stack can be extended. In the last section, we defined the language generated by a TLR grammar using the valid semiparse relation. In this section, we will prove that requiring valid transformations prevents the extension of the string on the symbol stack. This is essential to proving that the TLR parsing algorithm, the subject of the next section, is correct.

The framework presented in this paper for sequential MCMC consists of two sampling stages, referred to as the joint draw and refinement step. However, the framework is flexible in the sense that both sampling stages sample from the target distribution and are thus not both necessarily required for operation. The joint draw has the advantage of only requiring a single evaluation of the measurements. The refinement step introduces additional computational complexity but has also shown to significantly increase the efficiency of the sampling in higher dimensional state space models. Once an appropriate architecture for the sequential MCMC is selected, there is additional flexibility which arises in the form of selection of the proposal distributions. A common choice for the joint draw is to utilise the following proposal distribution:

By the time the simulation reaches 200 Myr (blue dot-dashed line), star formation has depleted the gas, causing the surface density to drop by a factor of 2.0 in disk SFOnly and 1.5 for disk SF+PEheat. Since star formation occurs in the coldest and densest regions of the disk, the azimuthally averaged temperature rises as do the corresponding values for the velocity dispersion and Q. The velocity dispersion also increases due to gravitational heating, as star particles are formed to create local deep potential wells. This effect is strongest in the disk without diffuse heating, since 500,000 more star particles have formed by this time, causing a greater depletion of the dense gas.

Packet based sample-and-hold has two advantages. Firstly, it can be inverted well to produce a reasonable estimate of the flow distribution even for relatively low sampling rates (approximately one in one hundred packets sampled). Secondly, it can be resampled to get a packet sample and recover those quantities which can be measured at the packet, not flow, level. A disadvantage is that the estimated probabilities are not guaranteed positive.

A subgroup H for which it does not exists a triple that verifies Condition PC will assure us that it is not possible to use our approach to attack an H-based cryptographic system.

The invariance of the truth of the relevant axioms under scaling is an important requirement. It follows from this that complex analysis based on scaled complex numbers is equivalent to that based on unscaled numbers. Equivalence means that every unscaled element in analysis has a corresponding scaled element in the scaled number analysis, and conversely. Also the truth of equations in scaled analysis is preserved under mapping to the corresponding equations in unscaled analysis. For example, for any analytic function, f, one has

Case without symmetry
However, due to the singularity of h at r = 0, and the fact that the transverse dimensions are non-compact, any integration over y is likely to be divergent. Worse, each term in the action will generally pick up different powers of the function h such that the divergences cannot even be gathered into a common divergence multiplying the entire action. This means that divergences will proliferate in the equations of motion, and our effective theory will be poorly defined. As a first step toward rectifying this problem, we assume there is some region of moduli space in which powers of h are well approximated by a series-expansion to first order:
B(X, Y) = Y4 + X4 + 6X3Y3 + X3Y7 + 6X4Y4 + X7Y3.
One of the main drawbacks of this approach is the lack of information regarding the coordinate space, which leads to ambiguities in the definition of the velocity of the particle. Also, one would like to have a classical version of the theory, in terms of a phase space endowed with a symplectic structure. This will be the subject of Sections 3 and 4.

Higher assumed values of σn (resulting from a higher mean density or larger density modulation index) make the observational limits more interesting and physically restrictive. Such limits could potentially argue against an anomalously elevated level of turbulence in the post shock region. On the other hand, a lower value of σn than that adopted in this calculation is less confining in terms of turbulence characteristics. The situation could be improved by x-ray observations of these remnants which would provide knowledge of the mean density in the downstream region and the shock speed.

On the other hand, since April 2007 we are operating the phase II of the Tupi experiment, with two directional muon telescopes at sea level and located at 22S and 43W, inside the SAA region and close to its central area. This characteristic supplies to the muon telescopes the lowest rigidity of response to cosmic protons and ions (≥ 0.4 GV). This value is approximately half of the rigidity of the polar regions. In addition, the SAA is like a hole in the magnetosphere and the IMF lines overtake the surface, in the day side, in this region. Consequently, the magnetic anomaly works like a funnel for incoming charged particles from space. The main effect of the SAA is an increase of the muon intensity at sea level in this region, in up to 10 times in the day side.

The simplest situation has 16 nine branes at each of the two orientifold planes to cancel anomalies; the low-energy dynamics consists of 11d supergravity in the bulk, and 10d SYM on these walls. Since the (2,1) string seems only to describe a brane in spacetime, to realize these vacua as a (2,1) string background one might look for a wrapped membrane/string that sees this structure, see figure 5.
As an approximation, we assume that the continuous dynamics of orientation within arcing segments of the trajectory are independent of the discrete reorientation events, and that the reorientation events are instataneous. Then the full orientation correlation function is the product of two terms,

Here we ask and answer, in the Bayesian MPE framework, the elementary question: What source brightness is needed to reduce the MPE below a given threshold for discriminating a single pair of closely spaced, equally bright point sources of a given separation from a single point source of the same brightness located at the midpoint of the line joining the pair? This defines a simpler problem of binary hypothesis testing within the Bayesian detection framework, avoiding a more involved problem in which the matter of such binary discrimination is coupled with the additional requirement of estimating the spacing between the point-source pair. The minimum signal strengths needed for this single source vs. pair source discrimination, as we shall see, are rather modest and consistent with the growing experimental evidence for high-precision optical superresolution (OSR) of point sources.

On the other hand, the dynamics of each sub-domain might be defined in terms of the characteristic curves associated with the activity variable. The flux across these curves must be characterized through the potential generated by the activity, that involves the sub-domains of the different populations. This is a challenging issue that needs more precise and detailed definitions which will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.

In this paper, we calculate the absorption coefficient of intergalactic space using a new, empirically based calculation of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of intergalactic low energy photons (Malkan & Stecker 1998; hereafter MS98) obtained by integrating luminosity dependent infrared spectra of galaxies over their luminosity and redshift distributions. After giving our results on the γ-ray optical depth as a function of energy and redshift out to a redshift of 0.3, we apply our calculations by comparing our results with recent spectral data on Mrk 421 as reported by McEnery, et al. (1997) and spectral data on Mrk 501 given by Aharonian, et al. (1997). The results presented here supercede those of our previous calculations (Stecker & De Jager 1997), which were based more on theoretical models (see discussion in MS98). We consider the results presented here to be considerably more reliable than any presented previously.
The quiver with two vertices a, b and with r ≥ 2 arrows from a to b is often called a generalized Kronecker quiver, and we call a path algebra of such a quiver a generalized Kronecker algebra.
Before going into the confined system, we first consider an infinite system. The phase diagram shown in Fig.1 consists of the three phases: The lower A phase is described by a chiral OP A0 + iAj (j = x or y) where the time reversal symmetry is broken. The high temperature B phase is described by A0 which is the one component scaler superfluid. In the following we examine the A phase in the confined geometries.

We then produced 100 samples of energy distributions with the MH and the adaptive MH methods, with chains of 40,000×N steps each. We note that in the adaptive MH method, qi(xi) corresponds to the the probability of spin i being in state xi. Data are again collected in the last quarter of each chain in both case, and we performed proposal distribution updates as detailed before in the third quarter of the chains in the adaptive M-H case (with the updating parameter α = 0.98).

The resonator and trap degree of freedom exchange quanta until they equilibrate to the same mean number of quanta, which is set by the background (e.g., thermal) number of photons in the microwave cavity. Note that while we describe here only cooling of the degree of freedom perpendicular to the chip surface, similar considerations can be applied to all trap degrees of freedom. Finally, we note that the trapping potentials experienced by the molecule in the upper and lower states may be different. However, sideband cooling can still occur in this regime and leads to similar cooling rates and final temperatures as described above.

Evaluation of the total cross section is a matter of integration over the many-body phase space, which is difficult to do analytically. For symmetry, we introduce the universal cutoff parameter s0, in the following way: all binary invariants are subject to a condition
Although this could be coincidental it definitely suggests that exploring the sub-eV regime of particle physics is a worthwhile enterprize.

Conventional particles can be the equivalent of phonons or solitons, as excitations of the superbradyonic ground state of matter (the vacuum) at the fundamental length scale. Their properties would then not be the ultimate fundamental properties of matter. Standard interactions may have been topologically generated in such a scenario. Also, our Universe may not be the only possible one. If different universes can also be formed, the properties of standard particles may be universe dependent.
Thus Nψ2 = in.
In strong contrast, in typical numerical simulations of phantom systems, all polymers (or particles) are ascribed to lattice sites, and then cross-links are randomly introduced, connecting some neighboring particles. After removing the sol part, the system is allowed to relax at nonzero temperature, with intra-cluster repulsion completely ignored. This corresponds to a large positive value for B0 but a vanishing value of B. As we shall soon see, it is this qualitative difference between B0 and B that is responsible for conductivity-like scaling of the shear modulus in phantom networks.

The length parameter l is introduced to keep the functions fρ to fπ dimensionless. A convenient choice is to set l equal the typical size of the perturbations, e.g., the horizon size at texture collapse. fρ/l2 and fp/l2 are the energy density and isotropic pressure of the texture field. fv is the potential of the velocity field and fπ is a potential for anisotropic stresses.
Going away from the flat region for intermediate φ-values, both towards smaller and larger values of φ we find a steeply increasing energy. The curve beyond φ = π continues precisely as for φ = 0. The maximum is relatively high and associated with a structure corresponding to the hexagonal structure which is energetically unfavored.
Solar abundance of manganese: a case for the existence of near Chandrasekhar-mass Type Ia supernova progenitors
As formulated by Wilson, the lattice cutoff is remarkable in remaining true to many of the underlying concepts of a gauge theory. At the most simplistic level, a Yang-Mills theory is simply electrodynamics embellished with isospin symmetry. By working directly with elements of the gauge group, this is inherent in lattice gauge theory from the start.
Studies of the Euler equations for free surface water waves are important to understanding the dynamics of ocean waves. The case of an idealized flat bottom and the resulting model equations has been widely studied for many years. The more realistic situation of varying bathymetry is less well known, despite its fundamental importance to studies of ocean wave dynamics in coastal regions, and there is not a complete consensus as to the appropriate model equations. In the case of topography there are many asymptotic scaling regimes of interest, including long-wave of modulational hypotheses for the evolution of the free surface, and short scale and/or long scale variations in the variable bottom fluid boundary.

Having in mind that one of the main ideas for why our proposed quantity CA/CF - i.e. the ratio of the quadratic Casimir for the adjoint representation CA divided by some representation F having the smallest quadratic Casimir CF among faithfull representations - is suggested to be that this quantity CA/CF, the bigger it, is favours the chanse that the group in question should be the one realized in nature because a big CA/CF means that varying the potential gauge an amount measured by the Killing form normalized by the adjoint representation Casimir being ut to say 1 makes the variation in the link variables supposedly in the representation F minimal, we shall here present as a couple of examples a practical calculation of our quantity, almost making clear its physical significance for our purpose.

From the above analysis, we see that a net, topologically nontrivial fundamental gap exists only at intermediate shell thickness. If the shell is too thin, then the effective gap is positive and the fundamental gap is topologically trivial. On the other hand, if the shell is too thick, then although the effective gap turns negative, the electron-like band overlaps with too many valence bands, which causes the hybridization gap to be covered up. Thus, no fundamental band gap would exist.
All the above parameters are set real and positive using U(1)R symmetry and an appropriate shift of the imaginary components of the moduli fields, while θ represents the relative phase among the exponentials. We also assume the relation between the parameters in the exponents
We conclude:
Both are parity conserving, since the original fermion action is parity conserving.

In fact, stronger results can be obtained. Namely, the product of two PPD functions or convolution of two PPD measures is good as soon as at least one of the original function or measures is good. The following theorem proves it for the functions. The statement for the measures follows via duality.

We shall focus on the following two classes of Bethe Ansatz states:
The same ideas can be applied in the specific situation of hierarchical models, taking advantage of the situations where we know that the semigroup of the associated codimension-zero product is normal. For example:
Here we have considered the (n+2)-dimensional Husain space-time in presence of radiating null fluid, barotropic fluid, an electro-magnetic field and a scalar field with potential. The corresponding solutions have been obtained. Next we have analyzed the gravitational collapse of a star in Husain space-time. The existence of outgoing radial null geodesic has been thoroughly investigated in order to characterize the nature of central singularity formed as the end state of collapse. Equation of radial null geodesic is formed and the values of the variable X0 is computed for different values of parameters in different dimensions. Surprisingly in all the cases it was found that irrespective of the values of the parameters chosen, the value of X0 is always positive and hence the singularity formed is always a naked singularity. This has been shown in a tabular form. Impact of accretion phenomenon on the gravitational collapse of a star has also been taken into account. The mass function for a collapsing procedure is considered and from it, the equation of X0 is constructed for various dimensions. To study this case graphs were drawn for different values of the parameters (f0, g0, e0, E0) and it was found that the figures did not show any tendency of sneaking into the negative region. Hence black holes may not be the correct option for Husain metric in any dimension. Formation of event horizons is totally barred in Husain metric. So the only possibility is a naked singularity. Hence this is a significant counterexample of the cosmic censorship hypothesis.

If a path is reparametrized, then, technically, it is a different point in path space. Does parallel-transport along a path of paths depend on the specific parametrization of the paths? We shall obtain conditions to ensure that there is no such dependence. Moreover, in this case, we shall also show that parallel transport by ω(A, B) along a path of paths depends essentially on the surface swept out by this path of paths, rather than the specific parametrization of this surface.

Therefore, H1 is α-subnormal. It implies ρ(H1) ≤ ρ(H2). When the inequality holds, f(H1) = H2 (otherwise ρ(H1) ≤ ρ(f(H1)) < ρ(H2)), and for any v ∈ V(H1) and e ∈ E(H1), v ∈ e if and only if f(v) ∈ f(e). This implies that f must be an injective map, (otherwise, we have f(v1) = f(v2), then we can find an edge e1 containing v1. Since f is a homomorphism, v2 is not in e1, but f(v2) = f(v1) ∈ f(e1). Contradiction.) Hence, f is an isomorphism.

In summary, using an rf-SQUID as a prototypical bistable system, we have demonstrated the existence of SR with single-cycle perturbation to the symmetric double-well potential of the system. Furthermore, we have investigated the possibility of exploiting SR for detecting small single-cycle and few-cycle signals in noisy environment. We have found that a proper amount of noise can lead to SR which enhances the sensitivity of detection. Our work provides insights into the behavior of bistable systems under the combined influence of weak single-cycle (or few-cycle) periodic modulation and noise. Because conventional techniques, such as phase sensitive lock-in and heterodyne detection schemes, are not applicable to detecting single-cycle and few-cycle signals buried in noise, the method demonstrated here is promising for applications where signals are unavoidably mixed up with noise and only last a very small number of cycles.

In our analysis we considered the situation when the scaling ansatz is obeyed exactly. We expect however that our results remain qualitatively valid even for systems with small deviations from the exactly scalable Hamiltonians. For example, weak lattice potentials should not have dramatic effects as long as the effective mass approximation is applicable. Therefore one could achieve a full description of time-of-flight experiments if the lattice potential and interactions are tuned accordingly. Moreover it is conceivable that on a phenomenological level the ansatz can be used even when the time- and space-dependencies of system parameters do not fully satisfy the consistency equations. The scaling solution could then be seen as a universality class of non-equilibrium systems, very much like a renormalization group fixed point at equilibrium. It would be interesting to address this conjecture in experiments.

Improvements are also required to estimate the stellar masses since a proxy (absolute J-band magnitude) of the stellar mass has been used in this study to select our sample. Combination of realistic stellar population with different ages and metal content has to be performed on both the whole spectral energy distribution (from UV to near-IR) and the spectroscopic absorption lines (Lick indices). Nevertheless, we do find that all distant starbursts are consistent with major merger phases, and these sources are strong emitters in near-IR. It is unclear whether we may have missed a significant population of massive starbursts without strong emission in near-IR. Besides this, technical limitations (see IMAGES-I) have prevented us from measuring the kinematics of 3 starbursts, because their emission line region are too compact (see Fig. 9). Their optical morphologies are also consistent with mergers (see Fig. 9 and its caption).

Basic Security Considerations
While one can actually determine the matrix element itself on the lattice, B-parameters are obtained from ratios of correlation functions in which many statistical and systematic uncertainties are expected to cancel. Furthermore, the matrix element has mass dimension four and therefore suffers very strongly from the uncertainty associated with the determination of the lattice cutoff which is of order 10% in present day quenched calculations. As we shall also see later, it is advantageous to get the matrix element from an independent determination of BBq and fBq and the experimental value of MBq.

where φD are constant in space and belong to the Cartan subalgebra C of G or rather, to a specific Weyl chamber in C. The matrix h(x) stands for a general element of G. In particular, every Casimir invariant polynomial of the Lie algebra, when calculated in terms of φ(x), which are in the support of Ψ(φ(x)), is x independent. This occurs since such φ(x), are contained in a single orbit of the adjoint action of G. To see that the support of Ψ(φ(x)) is given by eq. (B2-7), consider for a given φ(x) another Lie algebra element, τ(x), which is required to commute with φ(x).

While it is not possible to draw unambiguous conclusions from a comparison of theoretical results in infinite nuclear matter with data from finite nuclei, these results are extremely encouraging. At ρ0/2 the calculation suggests a reduction in the violation of unitarity by about 1/3, while at ρ0 a correction as big as 0.2% brings the discrepancy back to only one standard deviation.

Dense knots of material which follow ballistic trajectories may also be expelled from the disk by superbubbles. Knots formed by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities as a superbubble breaks through the disk material and begins to accelerate into the halo follow ballistic trajectories away from the disk, as they have significantly higher column densities than the halo material (Cioffi 1986). These knots of material may lead to relatively disconnected clouds of dense material in the low-halo of spiral galaxies. If dust survives in these fragments of the evolved superbubble, the ejected clouds may provide a source of halo dust grains. Greater knowledge of the degree to which dust can survive in the walls of supershells is needed to assess the role these structures may play in lifting dust beyond the thin disk of spirals.

According to this observation, Einstein EP states:

An extensive study was made including 16 samples among published work on terahertz QCLs from the last ten years, using our NEGF simulation scheme. Using identical simulation parameters, we find that the simulated current does not agree with experimental results for all samples. However, we observe a clear trend that these deviations are similar for samples form a given laboratory. This shows that samples from different laboratories are not fully comparable. We show that interface roughness alone cannot account for these deviations in the simulated current under lasing compared to experimental data. Assuming different calibrations of doping density or Al content in different laboratories could explain these trends. However more intricate issues, such as different barrier profiles, cannot be ruled out.

Introduction
In order to keep the noise as low as possible, we calculate the comoving separations directly in three-dimensional, flat, comoving space, assuming a perfectly homogeneous metric. That is, we do not attempt the commonly used procedure that consists of deriving the spatial two-point correlation function from the projected correlation function since that would require us to split pairs into a two-dimensional array, which would increase shot noise.

Bounds from ae are sensitive to the flavor representation, since MFV bounds compete with LEP bounds already in the low-mass region. For the case (3, 1), ae bounds exclude the gray area of low fermion-doublet masses. For the representation (1, 3), bounds from ae are of similar strength, but sensitive to the region with low singlet or triplet masses.
Now it is straightforward to finish the analysis of the Poisson brackets of the constraints of the Lagrange multiplier modified gravity. Since the Poisson brackets of the constrains corresponding to the gravity part of the action are the same as in General Relativity and since the scalar part of the constraints has exactly the same form as in previous section we immediately find that the Poisson brackets of the Lagrange multiplier modified F(R) gravity take the form

However, the increments 1+a when each node is introduced are not statistically independent. A particularly fruitful copying event for a high-degree target node increases the degrees of many neighboring nodes, which, in turn, affects the increment in the number of links in later node additions. Thus the growth in the number of links is governed by a correlated random-walk process and the central-limit theorem is not applicable to infer the asymptotic form of P(L, N).

Observables and NP parametrization
It is important to distinguish between these very different potential origins of the soft excess as they make very different predictions about the environment and geometry of the accreting material close to the black hole. The extreme broad iron lines required in the pure reflection models are not required in the absorption models (either smeared: Sobolewska & Done 2007; Done 2007 or partial covering: Miller et al. 2008) as the broad feature redwards of the iron line is fit instead by continuum curvature. All the absorption models require the presence of material above the inner disc, probably in the form of a wind, whereas the reflection models instead suggest a clean line of sight to the inner disc. The large velocity shear in the smeared wind model requires that the material is strongly accelerated, so it potentially carries an enormous amount of kinetic energy (Chevallier et al. 2006; Schurch & Done 2006) with corresponding impact on AGN feedback/galaxy formation.

The resulting differential equations for the approximations of the mean and quantum covariance matrix of the system observables form a self-consistent set of equations which, despite their nonlinearity, produce a legitimate quantum covariance matrix. Moreover, they preserve the CCRs of the system observables, thus making the effective linear dynamics physically realizable. We have demonstrated the approach for the quantum Duffing oscillator whose Hamiltonian is a quadro-quartic polynomial of the momentum and position operators.

In this section, we will describe the motivation for and construction of simple theories with global and local scale invariance. An important application is the lift of the standard model plus gravity into a Weyl-invariant theory that is also geodesically complete.

By including the effect of local lattice distortions in CuO2 layers, a new kind of Hubbard model has been proposed, with two sites on the links of the lattice. By integrating out high frequency modes in strong coupling perturbation theory a lattice gauge magnet was obtained. The resulting theory confines or screens the spin of hole quasiparticles at the intersection points (copper atoms), resulting in pairing and superconductivity. Because of the role of oxygen nuclear motion, at least a weak oxygen isotope effect should result. There is an second charge condensate, corresponding to the Goldstone mode of the fractionally charged, spinning Higgs field.

This illustrates a feature of the computational complexity model: the exact number of operations required to compute functions is quite sensitive to the technical choice of which basic operations to allow.

Several authors suggested that the bulk viscosity can drive the universe into a period of exponential expansion (inflation) (Murphy, Grφn, Beesham, Arbab). This is really the case, as the effect of bulk viscosity in an expanding universe is to decrease the pressure making the total pressure negative. Inflation can also be induced by higher order corrections (Starobinsky, 1980). In scalar field, inflation stopped by the slow roll-down of the scalar field from the false vacuum to the true vacuum. In this work, we investigate the coupling of gravity with vacuum and viscosity. Provided a certain conspiracy is maintained the evolution of the universe can proceed in an attractive way. We have found that such a recipe is possible and leads to interesting features related to the cosmic evolution. Inflation is triggered by the vacuum energy bulk viscosity cooperation. This work generalizes our recent model of phantom and dark energy models (Arbab, 2007).

Molecular cooling is described in Paper I, but now in addition, we have included metal line radiative cooling in the optically thin limit. To simulate metals in our simulations, we define a generic mass scalar in FLASH, which is advected with any flows. For the cooling rates we use the tabulated results from Weirsma et al (2008), which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, and in all cases we use standard solar abundance ratios. The radiative rates are defined over a large temperature range, from 102 K through 109 K. The specific cooling rate for a given temperature is found using a table lookup from a data file and scaling by the local metallicity.

The cutoff Coulomb approach is seen to produce accurately converged results for a single-shot calculation, regardless of the size of the simulation cell (as long as it is bigger than the extent of the nonzero density). The only requirement is that the original cell must, for the purposes of Fourier transforms, be embedded in a padded cell of sufficient size. This generally entails quite a large temporary memory requirement, and in small systems the performance of FFTs can become the limiting factor on the speed of the whole calculation. However, in large systems, where the Hartree calculation is generally not a significant part of the total computational effort, this is no longer an issue.

This is an extremely strong constraint which very much disfavors the natural solutions to the hierarchy problem, and is independent of the arguments we gave in the previous section. This is widely recognized and thus there has been a major effort to search for generic ways out or at least loopholes to this bound. On the other hand, even if there are loopholes, the bound still might be generic. In the context of the string landscape, the correct attitude would then be to accept it as preferred, also allowing the vacua (and cosmological histories) which realize the loophole, but weighing them by appropriate tuning factors. We will begin this discussion below.

Concluding remarks end the paper in Section 5.

The estimations using sunspot statistics were first attempted by Erofeev (2004) who found the estimated contributions of the Babcock-Leighton mechanism into the global poloidal field for eight solar cycles to correlate with the poloidal field amplitude of the following activity minima.

The contribution of the Babcock-Leighton mechanism to the poloidal field can be estimated by the sum,

The plane in fact can be chosen to be the x-y plane (say) because of the overall rotational invariance. The equilibrium configurations among these are governed by the same equations. Of these planer configurations we consider two special ones which are also solutions of the equilibrium equations, namely, (1) all N particles on a circle with centre at the origin and (2) (N-1) particles on a circle and one at the centre. For these configurations the respective energies are given by,

By solving analytically the master equation describing the evolution of the two qubits, we analyzed dynamics of the three GQDs, and found that they are incompatible in characterizing quantum correlations, although they are all well defined from a geometric perspective. Our findings are illustrated through two distinct behaviors of the three GQDs. First, we found that the three GQDs may exhibit completely different SCs for both the two-sided and the one-sided reservoirs. The critical times for the SCs and the times of SCs are strongly dependent on the choice of the GQD measure and the form of the initial state. Different GQD measures have different SCs, and thus the SCs are in fact the combined result of the chosen GQD measure and the quantum state, but not the intrinsic property of a state itself. This is fundamentally different from the sudden death of entanglement, which is independent of the entanglement measure. Moreover, we also revealed the relativity of different GQDs. To be explicit, we found that the thermal reservoir may lead to a generation of quantum states manifesting different orderings, and this implies that different GQDs are incomparable as their behaviors may not only be quantitatively but also be qualitatively different.

Thermodynamic functions are dominated by hard degrees of freedom. While long range correlations may survive in the quark-gluon plasma at very large temperature, the present picture suggests that such correlations do not contribute much to the thermodynamics. We find explicitly that the soft contributions are indeed small. We argued in particular that the contribution of collective modes is artificially amplified when the coupling is not too small by truncating this contribution at order g3.

The early part of curves within a few microseconds shows the Gaussian decay, indicating that the muon relaxation is caused by nuclear spins, which create a quasi static field around muon sites. This is confirmed by the observation that the weak LF of 100Oe completely suppresses the relaxation.

Renormalization
Introduction
One of the most important goals in surface science is to be able to control dynamical processes taking place at a surface. We have proposed substrate patterning as a means to control the relaxation dynamics of low-frequency frustrated-translational vibrations of an adsorbate overlayer. This proposal emerges from our recent work demonstrating that the dominant relaxation mechanism for these modes is resonant emission of phonons into the substrate. Specifically, we have considered short-period superlattices as candidate substrates, because the mass modulation of a superlattice causes gaps to open in the phonon density of states. Varying the superlattice composition allows one to control the size and placement of these band gaps, thereby controllably modifying the coupling between the adsorbate overlayer and the substrate. We view the successful experimental demonstration of the behavior predicted here as a stringent test of our theory of resonant adsorbate-substrate coupling. Moreover it would establish substrate patterning as an important tool in surface dynamical research.

At a proton-proton collider such as the LHC, the forward region is also a more sensitive probe of the forward-backward asymmetry in Z decays. Z bosons produced in the forward region are more likely to follow the initial quark direction and consequently suffer less from the dilution of the parton level asymmetry observed in the central region. This is discussed in more detail later in the text.

In summary, the MHD kink instability has been identified experimentally as a poloidal flux amplification mechanism for coaxial gun spheromak formation. An n = 1 central column helical instability was observed during formation using multiple-frame CCD imaging. Onset of the perturbation was shown using two independent sets of data to agree quantitatively with the Kruskal-Shafranov limit. The kink acts as a dynamo which converts toroidal to poloidal flux, and it is followed immediately by three key signatures of spheromak formation: (1) closed ψ-contours, (2) ψ-amplification, and (3) magnetic field profiles similar to the Taylor state.

Each entry in the comma separated list of exponents corresponds to an exponent of a Feynman parameter occurring as a monomial in the Feynman integral.

The remainder of this paper is devoted to considering solutions of the DSE resulting from different choices of vertex arising from various forms for these transverse components τi(k, p). The chief ingredients will be the matching to perturbation theory in the appropriate limit and the preservation of multiplicative renormalizability by the truncation scheme.
When we applied a laser pulse tuned to a wavelength of a metastable to short-lived transition, a sharp peak appeared in the ADATS, the intensity (area) of which was proportional to the number of antiproton annihilations induced by the laser pulse. Spectral line profiles could then be obtained by plotting the peak intensity against the laser wavelength as this was scanned through the central transition wavelength.

For the purposes of the first-passage calculation, we consider a spatial domain where all molecules released are eventually captured with probability one.

We define the time-integrated concentration
Because a physical pion would feel the boundaries of the box in which we work and because the algorithms we use slow down rapidly for lighter quarks, we are restricted to work with quarks with masses on the order of ms/2 or more. Thus, to obtain results at the physical values of the u, d and s masses, we perform all calculations for three values of the light-quark mass roughly in the range ms/2 → ms and extrapolate or interpolate to the physical mass values.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we derive the lateral shifts of TE and TM polarized light beams in transmission through the EO crystals, according to the stationary phase approach. In Sec. III, we discuss the electric control of the lateral shifts in the case of different crystal cuts. In the same section, an alternative way to realize the polarization beam splitter is also proposed. In Sec. IV, numerical simulations for Gaussian-shaped beam are made to demonstrate the validity of above theoretical results given by stationary phase method. Finally, a conclusion will be given in Sec. V.
More generally, it would also be interesting to know what aspect of regularity is responsible for superfrustration in arbitrary lattices.
Comparing Fig. 2 with Fig. 3, we see that the main difference between the clamped and unclamped case is that in the atomic layers with lateral composition modulation (layers 2 and 4), the hydrostatic strain (sum of all three diagonal strain components) is much smaller in the unclamped structure than in the clamped structure. This would lead to a major difference in the band-edge profile for the two structures to be discussed below.

Our analysis has shown that a self-calibrating approach to incorporating calibration uncertainties works well with the current SN Ia data sets. The self-calibrating Hubble diagram can be constructed for any compilation of data from various surveys as the photometric measurements are compared relative to a single reference star. However, we identified non-linear effects of the perturbation of the reference spectrum as an issue for using this method with the current data and included a quality cut for this in the data selection framework accordingly. Also we have omitted the retraining of the SN Ia light-curve template. Based on a related study this is only a 5% effect and hence will not alter the conclusions significantly. However, for a future study of the self calibration method, it would be appropriate to further investigate the role of the light curve training.

Nevertheless, matter does affect the free energy. It is interesting to describe this effect entirely in the flux picture. The idea is to see what is happening to the flux configurations when one side of the effective potential for the lines is lowered. Lowering the free energy means increasing the partition function. I will show that this increase in Z comes from an increase in the number of allowed flux configurations in the presence of matter i.e. an entropy increase.

Changing Mcut means that even though clusters in the MR models start at the same mass, their luminosities will be very different. Initially, clusters with a high Mcut will be much more luminous than those with a low Mcut. It might be thought that, as the high-Mcut clusters lose so much more of their mass, they will become less luminous.
Here, we argue that the scenario of HV is unlikely to be pertinent to the physics near BN in YbRh2Si2. A number of key features in the HV proposal contradict the salient experimental results.

In order to obtain a static RSA from a changing flip traversal, we use the notion of a trace. A trace is a domain on the βn × βn grid. It consists of edges and boxes: an edge is a line segment of length 1 whose endpoints have positive integer coordinates; a box is a square of side length 1 whose corners have positive integer coordinates. Similar to arborescences, we require that a trace R(i) is (topologically) connected; (ii) contains the root (1, 1); and (iii) from every grid point contained in R there exists an x- and y-monotone path to the root that lies completely in R. We say R is a covering trace for S (or, R covers S) if every sink in S is part of R.

The success of the J01 style mass functions, that are blind to the growth history of the universe (as opposed to the instantaneous growth factor), indicates that indeed the abundance of halos is insensitive to this. When the growth history is considered, via the alteration of δc in the ST mass functions, small, but not insignificant, differences between the ST and J01 predictions for the relative mass function in EDE and ΛCDM emerge. Future work with simulations containing sufficient volume to accurately probe the high mass range could discriminate between the two approaches to mass function fitting and determine whether the growth history affects halo abundances.

Therefore, as shown in the present paper, although the magnetic field freezing-in effect is universal (i.e., manifests itself in a similar way in media with isotropic and strongly anisotropic conductivities), the physical mechanisms responsible for it are absolutely different in these two limiting cases. In an isotropic plasma, freezing-in is due to induction currents, which compensate the variation of the magnetic flux through a closed contour moving together with the conducting substance. In the case of a plasma with a strong anisotropy, freezing-in is a direct consequence of particularities of the electrodynamic drift which are associated with the divergence-free character of the magnetic field and the equipotential character of the field lines.

Analysis of the VERA fringe survey data shows that the probability of detecting a 100 mJy source with 120 s of integration time is about 10%; the probability of detecting a 200 mJy source is 60%; and the probability of detecting a 300 mJy source is 80%.

With a PTA, we have a large number of independent pulsar terms. The impulse accelerations by fly-by PBHs appear in the pulsar terms as sparse and isolated signals with finite durations.

The relaxation time Trelax is the time-scale on which the cluster will lose all traces of its initial condition (Yadav et al. 2013). Due to internal dynamics of the cluster, the contraction and destruction forces make the cluster approach a Maxwellian equilibrium. Through this time, low mass stars may evaporate with large random velocities trying to occupy a larger volume than the high mass stars do (Mathieu and Latham 1986). Mathematically, relaxation time has the following form (Spitzer and Hart 1971):

The strong interaction is believed to be described by SU(3) gauge theory. As an asymptotic free theory, it has successful applications in high energy region (i.e., E > 1GeV), but in low energy region (i.e., E < 1GeV), one cannot make ordinaty perturbation calculations since, in this region, the coupling constant becomes large. To describe the physics of strong interaction in low energy region, one may develop some effective theories which reflect the symmetries and symmetry breaking in this energy region. In this note, we focus on the chiral effective Lagrangian theory.

Apart of the role of strange quark mass in general, there is also a general issue of correct connection of units and vacuum parameters (with the instanton density being one of them) for QCD with different number of flavors. (For example, between no-quark or quenched QCD and the physical world.) In order to study all of this, it important to know what is the absolute magnitude of the fermionic determinants in the instanton-based vacuum models considered. Some of those are repoted in this section.
We start by considering the total action for a bound system (in our present case, a galaxy) with a very large number N of constituents. Let E be the total energy.

Combining these two quantities, we get

The STAR Heavy Flavor Tracker, with its extremely precise and thin inner layers, is designed specifically to allow direct reconstruction, with low background, of charmed hadrons from their hadronic decay modes, from rather low pT up to 10 GeV/c. This allows one to investigate the chemistry of charm fragmentation, and search for its modification in heavy ion collisions, by reconstructing and comparing a number of different charmed hadrons from D0 to Λc. For flow studies, total charm cross sections, and correlations, the loss of information through the undetected neutrino in semi-leptonic decays causes ambiguities. These ambiguities prevent precise measurements in the hydrodynamic regime of parent DpT below approximately 2 GeV/c, and can complicate precise interpretation of suppression patterns at higher pT. Direct reconstruction of charmed hadrons using the Heavy Flavor Tracker removes these ambiguities.
We can choose our model parameters of Hamiltonian (equation 1) such that our hexagonal lattice contains an average of 2 atoms per unit cell or close to it.

The observed morphologies of low-power jets have been used to argue that they are turbulent and propagating at sonic or transonic speed on the large scale (Bicknell 1984, Bicknell et al. 1990). On the other hand, recent observational work (Giovannini et al. 1995) leads to the scenario in which jets of low-luminosity radio galaxies are relativistic on parsec scales. This is consistent with unified models, where FR I radio galaxies form the parent population of BL Lac objects (Urry & Padovani 1995).

No other phase transitions are detected below 5 GPa. The phase diagram of solid oxygen therefore has been completely determined, deleting uncertain phase transition boundaries at low temperature. The sensitivity of the X-ray diffraction technique has been essential to clarify the weakness of previous spectroscopic work, where phase transitions can be detected only by subtle kinks in the pressure slope of mode frequencies. In addition, the results of this work can furnish a precise recipe to be followed to avoid metastability and obtain a good annealing of an solid oxygen sample.
We have analyzed two-qubit gates in a pair of qubits, each encoded into singlet and triplet states of a DQD, and coupled by Coulomb repulsion. A two-qubit CNOT gate, which together with the single qubit rotations forms a universal set of quantum gates, can be performed by tuning the bias of the inner dots with respect to the outer ones. We identify the entangling interaction strength Ee as a quantity that has to be controlled in order to implement a CNOT with the aid of single qubit rotations.

The fact that clumps and their parental clouds share similar mass spectral forms suggests a common formation mechanism. Thus clumps could be built up by the same type of agglomerative and gravitational instability process that produced molecular clouds.

The option to model spatially correlated noise arises naturally in the formalism through the spectral function Cjk(ω). It allows for a spatially decaying correlation function with a distinctive correlation length ξ, i.e. one can transition smoothly between infinite, finite and no spatial correlations.

A charmonium state with large momentum is called isolated if there are no other hadrons whose momentum is nearly collinear. Charmonium that is produced from the decay of a b-hadron with large transverse momentum is never isolated, because the remnant hadrons from the decay of the b-hadron will have momentum that is nearly collinear.

The result is a trace mask containing the central locations of each fibre, at each pixel in the dispersion direction. The user specifies the distance between adjacent maxima, and they must also account for the large gaps between the blocks of 50 fibres. A visual inspection of the trace mask superimposed on the dome flat is therefore often required to check that the input parameters are satisfactory, and that the gaps are being dealt with accordingly, as this can be difficult to implement automatically.

Tracing the formation, evolution and final fate of MBHBs is certainly one of the open challenges of contemporary astrophysics. A better understanding of the interaction between MBHs and gas, and the prediction of new peculiar observational features of MBHBs are needed to unambiguosly constrain their properties and demography, adding an important missing piece to the galaxy evolution puzzle.

The final constraint comes from the study of tidally disrupted stars in globular clusters. Observations of globular clusters have shown tidal tails of stars actively being removed from these systems (Irwin & Hatzidimitriou 1993; Grillmair et al 1995) and have been used to argue that globular clusters do not contain dark matter (Moore 1996; Conroy et al 2010). If globular clusters reside within dark matter halos these tidal stars would be suppressed, which suggests that they formed via a different mechanism than galaxies.

The gravitational radius in the Schwarzschild solution in D = 4 is arbitrary, too. It is in fact possible to find a similar symmetry there. Although this arbitrariness and the existence of a corresponding symmetry in both dimensions are closely related to the arbitrariness in choosing boundary conditions, there is a crucial difference in both dimensions: Thanks to the Weyl invariance of the matter coupling in D = 2, the symmetry (2) is exact at the classical level even in the presence of the matter. That is, the matter does not feel the gravity mediated by the Weyl degree of freedom at the classical level, unless the matter coupling violates the Weyl invariance. (A test particle, for instance, would feel the black hole because its coupling violates the symmetry (2).)

Generally, in most models which aim for the Grand Unification of all forces in nature baryon number is not conserved. This has lead over the past two decades to extensive searches for proton decays into various channels. Present large neutrino experiments have in part emerged form proton decay searches and such detectors are well suited to perform these searches along with neutrino detection. Up to now numerous decay modes have been investigated and partial lifetime limits could be established up to 1033 years. These efforts will be continued with existing setups over the next decade and the detectors with the largest mass have highest sensitivity.

Again let Gn be the space of all unlabeled n-node graphs, and let Y(t) be a continuous time Markov chain on the state space Gn. As with the ordinary Edge Formation Random Walk, let edges have a uniform formation rate γ > 0 and a uniform deletion rate δ > 0, but now also add a triadic closure formation rate λ ≥ 0 for every 3-node path that a transition would close. The process is still clearly irreducible, and the stationary distribution obeys the stationary conditions Qn(ν, λ)πn = 0, where the generator matrix Qn now also depends on λ. We can express the stationary distribution directly in the parameters as πn(ν, λ) = {π: Qn(ν, λ)π = 0}. For λ = 0 the model reduces to the ordinary Edge Formation Random Walk.

Experiments
We borrow the ideas above and apply them to the context of nonequilibrium dynamics. The total Hamiltonian dictating the dynamics of the system is written in a basis that incorporates the initial state as one of its vectors. The width of the energy distribution of the initial state corresponds to the width of what we call, here, the energy shell. The lifetime of the initial state depends on how large this width is and on the filling of the shell. As we show, when the width of the energy shell is small compared to the width of the density of states and when it is not well filled, which happens for initial states close to the edges of the spectrum, the relaxation process can become very slow. This scenario is further aggravated by integrable Hamiltonians, the presence of symmetries, and the observable studied.

Silicate melts and glasses are an important class of materials in very different fields, e.g. in geosciences (since silicates are geologically the most relevant materials) and in technology (windows, containers, and optical fibers). From a physical point of view it is a very challenging task to understand the properties of these materials on a microscopic level, and in the last twenty years many studies on different systems have shown that molecular dynamics computer simulations are a very appropriate tool for this purpose (Angell et al., 1981, Balucani and Zoppi, 1994, Kob, 1999). The main advantage of such simulations is that they give access to the whole microscopic information in form of the particle trajectories which of course cannot be determined in real experiments.
Applying the pinch-technique (PT) construction to the three-gluon vertex occurring in a physical process involving three external on-shell legs, one arrives at a dressed tree-level skeleton graph, dressed with pinch-technique vertices and self-energies as shown in Fig. 2.

Photometric precision in lensing observation depends not only on the source brightness but also on the blended light from unlensed neighboring stars. Considering that faint stars are more affected by blending, we adopt blend to source flux ratios of Fb/Fs = 4.0, 1.0, and 0.25 for the individual source populations. With these ratios, the source brightness of a lensing event varies as

In Fig. 2 we plot the solutions of eq.(16). As seen, we have two solutions, as indicated by points A and C of Fig. 1, for T < Tc, and for T > Tc we have only one solution.

The physical meaning of the above results may become clearer by examining the pressure-volume isotherms.

This hybrid model also allows us to predict when the forward shock will break out of the CSM photosphere based on the fit to the optical light curve. The shock breakout will be followed by an X-ray/UV burst of radiation. The model may also be used to estimate the intensity of that radiation and the subsequent UV/X-ray LC. In Figure 9 we illustrate this by plotting the optical and UV/X-ray output LCs for a choice of parameters given in the captions for the case of SN ejecta interaction with a constant density shell (s = 0; left panel) and a wind (s = 2; right panel).

We will begin the computational analysis with the standard tent map given by:
An alternative approach that makes clear the connection between axis inversion and spin without the same difficulty, is to invert the axes that are perpendicular to the velocity. Our argument identifies the handedness of the coordinate system with the change of spin, hence inverting these axes should change the spin and does not impact on the direction of the velocity. We verify the effect of perpendicular axis inversion for momentum and velocity along the x̂3 direction and leave other verifications to known Dirac equation symmetries or exercises.

In this paper we present integrated magnitude and colours for synthetic clusters using the synthetic CMDs of star clusters. The integrated parameters have been obtained for the whole cluster population as well as for the MS population of star clusters. We have also estimated observed integrated magnitude and colours of MS population of galactic open clusters, LMC and SMC star clusters. The relation between observed integrated colours for whole cluster population and MS population are fairly explained by the model predictions obtained in the present work. This indicates that the estimated observed integrated colours of MS population of MC clusters fairly represent the MS population of the MC clusters. Main conclusion of the present study are;

With the lemma, we can design an improved degree distribution based on a target k for LT codes with low overhead. Denote σ ∈ (0, 1] as the ratio of the spike being reduced from RSD (degree-1 node is increased accordingly). Then we can obtain the equations as below to analyze its asymptotic behavior:
The main goal of this subsection is to prove some estimates involving the minimax levels cλ, k, c0, k, c∞ and cf∞.
The collocation that ends with an adjective is created from a word combination adjective + noun in the original text. The adjective describes one particular feature of the noun; this yields on a new collocation in which noun becomes the actor and adjective an object of the collocation. We assign the wordsein a linking role in the collocation and represent it as a fact. The new collocation inherits the collocation number of the sentence, which it was a part of and thus preserves the time flow of the text. This way we achieve the unique sentence structure that we need, and keep the original semantical value of the text.

Special attention is given to the realistic scenario where the channel state is not known perfectly at the receiver. Rather, it must be inferred from available observations. In this latter case, the optimization problem becomes a partially observable decision process. This forces the controller to make decisions based on an estimated distribution over the channel state. This problem is cast into a dynamic programming framework with limited state knowledge. Known system dynamics and partial observations are combined at every step to update the estimated distribution and, subsequently, take action.

Tetramer-dimer phases
DIS processes provided the first measurement of parton densities. We saw in the previous sections that a combination of the different (weak and electromagnetic) structure functions with different targets (proton, neutron, isoscalar nuclei) can be used to establish different properties of the charged partons such as their spin, charge assignment etc. The individual parton densities can be extracted from the data on F2 only under certain assumptions and one usually fits a form to these. The fits are constrained by various sum rules which are derived on general principles. However, none of the DIS processes can give information about the gluon densities. In the framework of perturbative QCD, outside the realm of quark-parton model, some information about gluon densities is obtained by studying the scaling violation (q2 dependence) of the structure functions. But no direct information on the gluons is available from these processes. It is also important to note that since there are, as yet, no theoretical predictions for either quark/gluon densities, it is imperative to find processes other than DIS to extract combination of parton densities different from those measured in DIS, to supplement our knowledge. This, in turn, can help to get a more complete picture of parton densities.

The calculations show clearly that the Fe ii continuum is significant in this region. Of the three calculated minima, the one at the shortest wavelength (about λ1640) is not well matched to the observations. It is certainly Fe ii and not Si, as a separate calculation (not shown) has revealed. There is a possibly corresponding feature to be seen in the spectra of α2 CVn and HR 6000, though much weaker than in the calculations. This region deserves further study.

It is tempting to identify the smaller and less polarized sub-component with the optically thick jet-base and the larger and more polarized sub-component with the optically thin inner jet. The fact that the total intensity is less variable than the polarized intensity indicates that the polarized sub-components are considerably smaller than the component(s), which dominate in total intensity. Of course, this simple scenario could change, if a larger number of independently varying sub-components exist or if some sub-components vary in a coherent manner. It is also possible that the variability of the sub-components is not due to scintillation, but is source intrinsic or, more likely, a mixture of both effects.

An effect on the shape parameter x1 can also be observed.

Strictly speaking, the topological protection is lost if the system strays too far from the instantaneous ground state and the Majorana mode leaks to the continuum (separated by the bulk gap). Here we consider permissible velocities v(t) < vmax so that we are never too far from the adiabatic limit with respect to the bulk gap. The evolution, however, does create nonadiabatic excitations within the bound-state spectrum of the domain wall, which are corrected by our optimization scheme.
We have shown in this paper the existence of first order phase transitions in the road network, the properties of which and its mathematical proof will be further studied in a future work.

In view of these concerns, this paper is aimed at exploring the evolution of DB white dwarfs in a self-consistent way with the predictions of time-dependent element diffusion. Emphasis is placed on the chemistry variations along the evolutionary stages during which these stars are expected to pulsate. Specifically, we hope to address the following question: Is it possible that the diffusion-induced, double-layered structure could be altered by further chemical evolution to such an extent that a single-layered configuration emerges before the star reaches the red edge of the instability strip?. In view of the lack of previous calculations of the mass-dependence of time-dependent diffusion profiles, we judge that this question is an important one to be answered. Additionally, we extend the scope of the paper and explore the consequences of diffusively evolving chemical stratifications for the adiabatic pulsational properties of the models.

The main ingredients for studying the cluster number density are the critical density contrast δc(z) at the collapse point, above which structure collapses, and the growth factor, D(a) = δ(z)/δ(0). In order to calculate these quantities, we assume that the dark matter and dark energy components are uncoupled (except gravitationally) and study the non-linear evolution of matter perturbation by adopting a spherically over-dense region of radius r numerically. This over-dense region follows the Raychaudhuri equation;

The stellar luminosity is computed from the J magnitude and AJ, using a bolometric correction similar to that adopted by BAK01:
As expected, small values of L result in a larger effective beam in the direction of the scan. The shape in a direction perpendicular to the scan direction is not affected. Overall, the larger effective beam size will result in a degraded sensitivity to spatial structures which are on the scale of the nominal resolution.

A Montecarlo time step is a sequence of N random moves where N is the number of sites in the finite realization of the graph G. We will focus on the non-equilibrium situation where a completely random initial configuration, corresponding to an equilibrium state at T = ∞, is instantaneously quenched to a temperature equal or smaller than Tc.

In our pursuit of confinement effects we were following the logic of the great Chinese warrior-philosopher Master Sun Tzu who said:
The most interesting open problem following from our work is to understand the extent to which the inequivalence between entanglement and nonlocality holds. With the current state of knowledge, our results show that there exist GME N-party states that have a 2- and even 3-local model. Now, what is the maximum value of K such that there exist N-party states with a K-local model for any N ? In particular, are there genuinely entangled N-party states with a fully local model? This happens to be the case for N = 2, 3, but no results are known beyond these two cases. A related question is whether there exists some threshold value of N above which the GME states are too entangled to allow for a fully local model.
In this paper we use a modified version where we allow interactive exchanges between the prover and the verifier but preserve the requirements on lower total complexity for the verifier. Moreover, we then can convert back these two-rounds protocol into one round protocols via Fiat-Shamir heuristic: hash the input and commitment with an unpredictable and universal hash function (such as a cryptographic hash function), to simulate the random challenges proposed by the verifier.

The LEP measurements told us that no new particles with masses below MZ have a significant coupling to the Z. However, they tell us little about particles which have small coupling to the Z, and cannot rule out the existence of light particles. Particles with small Z coupling are still allowed and can have interesting couplings to Higgses and fermions.
In a chain geometry the couplings J13 and J24 would not be present and the resulting RG flow always generates AF couplings. However, for extended, not strictly 1d objects, some of the generated new couplings can be ferromagnetic (e.g. if J12 < J13 and J34 > J24 or vice versa) and therefore the decimation rules have to be extended. If at one RG step an F bond turns out to be the strongest one, its decimation will lead to an effective spin S̃ = 1. In the following steps, the system will renormalize to a set of effective spins of different magnitude interacting via F and/or AF couplings.

Introduction
The proof can be completed for the general case by considering actions of involutions on solid pillows. In fact if α corresponds to a mirror reflector or to a corner reflector in B, the stabilizer of α acts effectively on a solid pillow. The stabilizer leaves invariant α and the singular set, thus the elements of the stabilizer are of order two. We have two possibilities: the involution either fixes pointwise α or exchanges its endpoints. If the involution exchanges the two endpoints of α we have two possible actions on the singular points of the boundary of the solid pillow. Distinguishing these three cases we can consider the action of the stabilizer of α on the solid pillow and the action induced on the base orbifold. For each of the three cases the situation is different according to the parity of p and q where p/q is the slope of the generic fiber in the solid pillow (here p and q are considered coprime). Finally we have to analyze nine cases, but in each we find that the quotient of the base orbifold and the base orbifold of the quotient coincide.
Finally, the shape of the spectra at low-bias voltage is indicative of an isotropic tunneling matrix element. We conclude that the tunneling matrix element does not have a strong dependence on the (in-plane) wave vector. Tunneling spectroscopy therefore probes states along the whole Fermi surface, including the diagonals of the Brillouin zone.

Then every maximal simplex in the chain falls into one of the following types:

In conclusion, the LHC 750 GeV diphoton excess implies the presence of yet another resonance at 950 GeV, that is the color-singlet isotriplet-technipion, P ±, 3, in the one-family model of walking technicolor. The P ±,3 mass is completely fixed at 950 GeV, which is free from any detail of the walking dynamics, once the 750 GeV resonance is identified with the color-singlet isosinglet-technipion, P0(750). The P ±,3(950) are singly produced at the LHC via vector boson and photon fusion processes, and doubly produced by the (2 TeV) technirho decay. Those technipions predominantly decay to Wγ (for the charged P ± (950)) and γγ (for the neutral P3(950)). In particular, the charged P ± (950) signal is quite intrinsic for the Wγ channel, which yields sizable cross section, leading to an intriguing topology such as dijet plus mono-photon (along with forward jets). This is the rare signal for other charged heavy scalars as in models with the extended Higgs sector, so it will be characteristic only for the P ± (950), to be accessible at the Run 2, or 3.
In this paper we restrict our attention to non-parametric estimates of the real space correlation function. However given the sensitivity of the measured clustering to the weighting scheme adopted, we fit both the unweighted and the weighted real-space correlation function from Meyer et al. (2007). From their estimated correlation function, Meyer et al. (2007) calculate a correlation length for the HIPASS galaxies. In this paper our aim is instead to interpret the astrophysical context of the measured clustering, namely the distribution of HI galaxies within the dark-matter halo population and the typical dark matter halo mass.

Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science and mathematics that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined by bounding space are the following:

Despite of a large number of theoretical works on equilibrium and nonequilibrium effects in S/F/S structures, some important features of the effects remain unclear. In this report we discuss the influence of different relative orientations of the magnetizations on the critical Josephson current in a tunnel SF/I/FS junction. Its electrodes consist of SF bilayers. The critical current Ic is not zero if the thickness of the ferromagnetic F layer is thin enough and depends on relative orientation and absolute values of magnetization or exchange energy h. Surprisingly the current Ic turns out to be not decreasing, but increasing function of h in the case of antiferromagnetic configuration (the magnetization vectors are aligned in opposite directions in the electrodes). Therefore the critical current at nonzero h exceeds its value in the absence of h.

There is a new hot disk model, where weakly relativistic protons produce various secondaries in their interaction in the disk (Mahadevan 1998), but this model also cannot explain any particles at 1018 eV.
After initial calibration no targets were found sufficiently bright for self-calibration, and a calibration scheme had to be developed to use the signal from many faint, separate sources for self-calibration. This scheme works as follows:
Figure 2 shows the spectrum of each component derived here, together with a comparison of the summed spectrum to the spectrum of the unresolved pair presented by Kirkpatrick et al. (2011). The inset plot compares our H-band sections to the resolved spectra obtained previously at Keck by Liu12. The agreement with the Keck data is excellent, and that with the unresolved spectrum is reasonable, given the noise in each measurement. These comparisons validate our extraction of the one-dimensional spectra from the two-dimensional images.

Mitra and Rankin (2002) found that the emission heights range from about 500 km for frequencies above 1 GHz up to 1100 km for the lowest frequency of 100 MHz. Together with the known radio fluxes (Kramer et al. 1997) we were able to match the described model to the data and determine the dissipation length scales for frequencies between 100 MHz and 30 GHz. To enhance the realism of the fit, the relativistic (Muslimov & Tsygan, 1992) corrections to the Goldreich-Julian densities and effective areas were also included. In this case we calculated the local Goldreich-Julian density through

The latter condition implies, of course, the vanishing of its integral δf over any angular domain, so it is the appropriate generalization of the condition of Petterson, Silk & Ostriker (1980).

We identified two kinds of observables that can be used to probe this dynamic effect. First, we looked at data on neutrinos from astrophysical sources, in particular, from SN1987A. If neutrinos from SN1987A emitted Goldstone bosons on their way to the Earth, they would have deflected away and the number of neutrinos to arrive at the Earth would have changed. Because the data tells us that the neutrinos travel from the supernova basically without interaction, we can put stringent constraints on the size of Lorentz violation. We also applied cosmological considerations to put bounds on the model parameters. We know that the CMBR power spectrum agrees with the presence of three standard neutrino species. Significant energy transfer from neutrinos into the Goldstone field would affect standard cosmology, and would therefore be inconsistent with observations.

Notice, that Weak Quantum Theory, at least in its minimal version presented here, does not associate quantified probabilities to the outcomes of a measurement of an observable A.

As a conclusion, we can say that a charged black hole can accelerate protons up to extremely high energy, with a power spectrum according to present observations and well focused on high energy. The observed multiplets can also be explained through the long emission time. Possible further traces of such electric black holes could be the gamma ray bursts, whose rate is able to recover the observed flux.

The Standard Model of particle physics is a chiral gauge theory and all of fundamental fermions are divided into two classes, LH and RH chirality state, and they have different gauge transformations. Especially, RH chirality states have zero weak isospin and are only present in neutral weak currents. In charged weak currents, all fermions are in the LH chirality states while all antifermions are in the RH ones. For example, the negative muon decay can be written as

There exist several measures to characterize the performance of a detector. Furthermore, their relative importance depends on the specific application in question. The requirements for a good detector include low noise, sufficient speed and good impedance matching between the receiver antenna and the detector element. Different detectors such as transition edge sensors and kinetic inductance detectors excel in different areas and operation regimes. When considering any one particular high-end application, the choice of the detector needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the qualities and properties required.

In this paper, we have proposed a new approach for the co-clustering and co-categorization of bi-lingual data when a comparability mapping exists. This approach, that could be characterized as a kind of three-mode clustering or categorization, is based on the concept of similarity induced by a comparability bipartite graph. The three-mode data analysis scheme is implemented as a mixing model used to merge native and induced similarity measures inside each of the two linguistic space. The assessment of this mixing model on purely synthetic random data is quite informative and demonstrates the noise reduction capability of the method.

While the uncertainty in the relevant parameters (namely, the distribution of Rbubb of radio plasma, and the filling factor f, the Spitzer fraction fSP) is too large to conclude that visco-rotational heating is an important contributor to the thermal evolution, the study shows that the process should be studied further: It is clear that it must happen at some level when AGN-driven waves pass over the existing pockets of radio plasma, and under the right conditions, it can be very important in the extraction of energy from sound and shock waves in clusters.
The adjustment of phase and frequency in large systems of oscillatory units can lead to global coherent oscillations, i.e. synchronization. On the other hand, noise and heterogeneity in the system can weaken synchronization, or even destroy it. Synchronization in the nervous system can facilitate the transfer of information or cause epileptic seizures. Multistability and hysteresis of normal and pathological collective behavior is observed. When all oscillators are identical and the coupling tends to decrease phase differences a state of complete synchronization is asymptotically stable. But even in random networks with uncorrelated and homogeneously distributed node degrees this absorbing state may not be reached or disappear when it is perturbed locally. Here we perform a detailed numerical analysis of the transition between different states of synchronization in a directed small-world network of phase oscillators. By varying the mean in-degree of the network or the nonlinearity of the phase coupling function at zero phase difference, we find discontinuous and continuous transitions with mean-field critical behavior.

There are two ways in which possibility (2) can occur. As described earlier, for any fixed region ΛL the measure νt, τ(t) can settle into a pure state for almost all σ0 and ω, but the pure state depends on the dynamics as well as the initial state. But a second possibility, that has not yet been discussed, is that νt, τ(t) never settles down to a single pure state: the system is usually in a pure state α(t) locally, but the pure state forever changes. Nevertheless, νt, the full average over the dynamics, still yields a single limit. This is to be contrasted with possibility (3), where even the fully averaged measure νt never settles down.

Among the nonperturbative properties of QCD, color confinement is one of the most important subjects remaining in elementary particle physics, and is also an extremely difficult mathematical problem. The difficulty is considered to originate from non-Abelian dynamics and nonperturbative features of QCD, which are largely different from QED. However, it is not clear whether quark confinement is peculiar to the non-Abelian nature of QCD or not.

In case of partially contained (PC) events the momentum has been determined from the curvature of the track at the vertex due to the magnetic field applied across the detector. Due to limitation of our PC event reconstruction algorithm we considered PC events with hits < 20.

The authors never claimed that SIS multilayers do not protect SRF cavities against magnetic flux penetration. In fact, it was shown that the superheating field of the SIS structure can, for optimal thicknesses, be slightly higher than the bulk value of the film material.

In estimating the quoted significances, we have assumed that the decay t → bW + makes up the dominant background. This should be refined by taking into account non-t-backgrounds, such as coming from (Z, W) + jets.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss exact and approximate symmetry methods for the solution of DEs. Section 3 contains exact symmetries of the Minkowski spacetime and the first-order approximate symmetries of the Schwarzschild spacetime. In section 4, we study approximate symmetries of the stringy charged black hole solutions, i.e., electrically and magnetically charged solutions. Finally, we summarize and discuss the results in the last section.

Two important questions still remain to be answered: 1) What is the high-mass stellar census of the young stellar clusters and how does this depend on the cluster properties (such as luminosity and evolutionary phase)? 2) What is the interaction between the massive stars and their immediate environment? The recent development of near-IR integral-field spectroscopy offers a great opportunity since it provides simultaneous and complete information on the stellar content and on the diffuse nebular emission.

The sojourn time associated with a process term P is thus the minimum of the random variables quantifying the durations of the exponentially timed actions enabled by P. Since the minimum of several exponentially distributed random variables is exponentially distributed and its rate is the sum of the rates of the original variables, the sojourn time associated with P is exponentially distributed with rate equal to the sum of the rates of the actions enabled by P. Therefore, the average sojourn time associated with P is the reciprocal of the sum of the rates of the actions it enables. The probability of executing one of those actions is given by the action rate divided by the sum of the rates of all the considered actions.

Simplified search for an optimal clustering
If the photons are not coincident, the delays are different. Then one photon took the long path and the other took the short, and the emission time can be calculated easily as the early detection time minus the short path length divided by the speed of light. In this case, there is only one possible way that the photons could have reached the detectors, and there will be no interference. Therefore, these events are not useful in our setting and are discarded.

Also, we have found analytically the QNFs for massive fermionic fields for the mode with lowest angular momentum, being the QNFs purely imaginary and negative, which guarantees the stability of these black holes under fermionic fields perturbations. Interestingly, in this case we obtain two sets of Dirac QNFs that cover all the range of mass (positive and negative) of the fermionic field in analogy with Neumann boundary condition which yields two set of modes in the BTZ black hole. On the other hand, we have shown that the lowest QNFs for massive fermionic fields for the mode with higher angular momentum, have a real and imaginary parts, by using the improved AIM.

A noticeable difference from the case of the thread is that for polymers the exponent of the power law is non-universal and depends on the parameter D of the Kraichnan model. This is due to the presence of the dimensionless parameter λτ. It should also be noticed that even above the coil-stretch transition, Pss(R) can be a decreasing function of R, which has a normalizable singularity at R = 0.

When calculable at all, phenomenological results in QCD are often obtained in a factorized form: a physical quantity is given as a product of a perturbative short-distance part times a low-energy contribution. The splitting into the two parts is regularization dependent. If one manages to evaluate the low energy part with a lattice simulation, one also needs the high energy part in the same regularization. This requires a perturbative calculation in lattice regularization. Such calculations are, however, tedious. First of all, the propagators are much more complicated than in the continuum. The simplest discretization of the bosonic propagator in four dimensions is

Here we report the first study of TIP wave packet dynamics much beyond the single particle localization length and discover the new phenomenon of quantum chaotic subdiffusion. This is exhibited in the weak disorder regime, characterized by the large connectivity of Fock states, when the packet size exceeds ξ1 but does not yet reach its asymptote ξ2. We find that in this regime the system demonstrates the two main signatures of quantum chaos: dynamical excitation of a wealth of Fock states and strongly non-Poissonian level spacing distribution. Based on this, we argue that the TIP subdiffusion in Fock and in real space can be described as subsequent excitation of unpopulated Fock states by a multifrequency and quasistochastic driving from a large number of already populated ones. Numerics and analysis estimate the subdiffusion exponent as 1/2 in a remarkable correspondence to the strong chaos subdiffusion in the classical nonlinear wave equation. Asymptotic dynamics differs though, in the crossover to a weak chaos subdiffusion of the nonlinear case, and slowing down towards a complete arrest of the TIP excitation.

With the advent of ever larger on-chip memory and multicore processors that allow multithread programming, it is now possible to propose a new paradigm in which each thread, with access to a common memory, computes its own estimate of the solution to the whole problem (i.e., decomposition of the problem into subproblems is avoided) and the threads exchange information amongst themselves, this being the cooperative step. The design of a cooperative algorithm has the objective of ensuring that exchanged information is used by the threads in such a way as to reduce overall convergence time.

One may decide to assign the φ field the role of a conjugate momentum. In that case the target space role shifts to the manifold of gauge configurations. It is not by changing language that the phases will change.
The bin sizes are determined according to two criteria. We require that there are a minimum number of 10 stars per bin. This gives us a large enough statistical sample that we reduce the above effect, and prevent small number statistics leading to outlying points. We also set a minimum bin size of 0.1 radians. This avoids the oversampling of high density regions of the stream, which can lead to unphysically rapid oscillations in the mean track.

In any case, the INC/de-excitation (dynamical/de-excitation) approach is the only one which can tackle with the same (combined) model all residue formation channels, from one-nucleon removal channels to deep spallation channels where a substantial fraction of the target nucleons are removed.
The cryptosystem offers a guaranteed convergence to the plaintext solution, in the thermodynamic limit N → ∞, as long as p < ps.

Again we got the same answer for r, which means that for partitions with large number of qubits r depends neither on m, k, l nor on a, b, c. More precisely, r depends only on the expression ma2 + kb2 + lc2 = | ψ | 2, which drops out owing to the normalization condition.

Therefore, increasing r decreases the right-hand side of the inequality of the lemma. As such, proving it for one value of r proves the lemma for all smaller values of r. It thus suffices to prove the lemma for the limit as r → ∞ of the right-hand side of the lemma.

Using the process of thermalisation or of evaporative cooling, two important applications using the process of thermalisation or of evaporative cooling are interesting to study: first, the conversion of a high frequency pulse of light to a pulse of lower frequencies given by the Bose-Einstein distribution; second, the generation of a multicolor light out of a monochromatic one through an appropriate redistribution of the spectrum. We explore the possibility to use dielectric structures and multimode optical fiber gratings to realise the first application.

One advantage of our procedure is that while many-body calculations in principle begin from wave functions and subband eigenenergies derived from some Hartree calculation, the variation of these properties with density and the aforementioned kinematical corrections to the bandgap are usually ignored. By contrast DFT automatically includes these. Furthermore, the separate contributions from kinematic effects as opposed to exchange and correlation are easily isolated (to first order) by performing a calculation without the exchange-correlation potential (i.e. Hartree only).

Based on the relationships previously analyzed and specially in the analogous behavior between quantum mechanics and game theory, it is suggested the following (quantum) understanding of our system (classical and/or socioeconomical): If in an isolated system each of its accessible states do not have the same probability, the system is not in equilibrium. The system will vary and will evolve in time until it reaches the equilibrium state in where the probability of finding the system in each of the accessible states is the same. The system will find its more probable configuration in which the number of accessible states is maximum and equally probable. The whole system will vary and rearrange its state and the states of its ensembles with the purpose of maximize its entropy and reach its equilibrium state. We could say that the purpose and maximum payoff of a physical system is its maximum entropy state. The system and its members will vary and rearrange themselves to reach the best possible state for each of them which is also the best possible state for the whole system.
In above gauge, we get the effective Lagrangian which possesses the global U(3)L × U(3)R symmetry.

The model with dual mediators
Under harsh radio channel conditions it is not possible to ensure that all the packets are received. Neither it is possible to ensure that all packets are received before the deadline. This is due to the probabilistic nature of the radio link, indeed there is a chance that a packet is not correctly received even after many retransmissions. RTXP is designed with the goal of avoiding probabilistic behaviors, channel access and forwarder selection are deterministic, so the behavior is predictable and we can ensure that packets meet their deadline. Nevertheless, the radio channel introduces a probabilistic aspect thus one can legitimately ask if it is worth it to have a deterministic protocol on a probabilistic channel. In the next sections this issue is further investigated.
As the rate in the first interval 0.00< x <0.05 is experimentally not accessible in this analysis, we estimate the branching fraction in this interval using our Monte Carlo simulation to model φ production. This interval has 3.6% of the total φ yield, which corresponds to a branching fraction of 0.24%. We take the error as equal to the value. The total production rate then is

which, even with quite moderate parameters (like γ = 10, xem = 50, N = 1013 for a typical pulsar), causes an enhancement of some 103. Therefore it can easily explain strong substructures, and micropulse brightness temperatures that are some 103 times above the mean value (Boriakoff, 1992).
We provide two sets of results on estimating SUGMs: one concerning settings in which the networks are sparse enough so that estimation can be made via direct counts, and a second concerning an algorithm for more general estimation when networks are dense enough so that there could be substantial overlap in the various subgraphs formed which makes counting more challenging.

The aim of this project is to determine how the maser characteristics correlate with trends in the infrared colours of the sample. Preliminary results show a lower number of LI objects detected at 1667 and (particularly) 1665 MHz, compared with the other sub-groups in the sample. This shows a possible correlation between mainline emission and stellar mass in post-AGB stars, with mainline masers being preferentially disrupted by the bipolar outflows and/or magnetic fields in higher-mass PN precursors.

The chosen energy interval is the window where a perceived experiment would measure energies of the outgoing α-particles. The dominating contributions come, as intuitively expected, from transitions between resonance states. The cross section is now computed as a function of initial energy for photon emissions into an energy window of width comparable to the width of the final state resonance. When the initial energy is within the energy interval, allowing zero photon energy, an unphysical bump appears. This infrared catastrophe is due to omission of the elastic scattering channel. We remove the bump by omitting a corresponding peak, low-lying and well-defined, corresponding to inclusion of large distances before regularizing in the calculation of matrix elements.

In particular no numerical approximations are needed at any stage.

Both the star formation process and the distribution of metals can be affected by numerical resolution. Particularly important for our model is the fact that the smoothing length of the particles (i.e. the radius which encloses ≈32 gaseous neighbours) determines the region where the newly released chemical elements are injected. Mosconi et al. (2001) found that chemical abundances could be oversmoothed in low resolution simulations because metals are distributed over a comparatively large volume and, consequently, are more efficiently mixed with surrounding gas. On the other hand, high numerical resolution could also produce spurious results if the metal mixing mechanism becomes too inefficient. Provided other physical mixing mechanisms are not operating, the simulation results might show an artificially large dispersion in gas metallicities.

As it stands, this functional determinant makes sense only perturbatively in weak fields, e.g. with the help of dimensional regularization. However, it may be defined also non-perturbatively as a product of eigenvalues after suitable continuation to Euclidean spacetime. This definition requires an infrared regularization that renders the spectrum discrete, as well as an ultraviolet regularization on the infinite number of possibly large eigenvalues. Both regularizations can be naturally achieved using heat-kernel methods.

In this paper, we investigated the use of load repartition for congestion control of video flows in a wireless sensor network with multipath support. The motivation of this study is to maintain the video quality unchanged by splitting a video flow on multiple path instead of decreasing the transmission rate. Various load repartition strategies are therefore proposed and evaluated. The preliminary results show that load repartition does improve congestion control by reducing the packet drop probability. Regarding fairness, which is a key factor in congestion control, the preliminary results show that even simple load repartition strategies can have a very high impact on performances. However, depending on the targeted video applications on the sensor network, one may choose to prefer either rate fairness among sources or load fairness among active sensors. More importantly, it has been shown that distributing the traffic on all the available path from the beginning is not efficient in term of energy nor in term of fairness.

The weak dependence of the scatter on the feedback parameterization is an immediate consequence of how the rotation velocity of the galactic disk responds to changes in the ratio between stellar and dark mass. As more and more baryon assemble in the central stellar disk, their luminosity increases but also the disk rotation velocity due to the gravity of the additional matter near the center. This effect is amplified as the additional gravity also pulls dark matter towards the center. Consequently a variation in the star to dark matter fraction results in a shift predominately parallel to the TF relation which thus does not cause substantial additional scatter (see Navarro & Steinmetz 2000 for a detailed discussion)

The main sources of correlated systematic uncertainty are the background cross sections and the energy scale of the detector. As they modify the shapes of the fit distributions, their effect is evaluated performing a new fit to calculate the cross section once their values are modified as listed in Table 5. Possible non-linearity effects for the energy scale are investigated. The effect of the uncertainty of the LEP beam energy is negligible.

The success of supernova (SN) models, confirmed by observation, often implies strong constraints on several kinds of new physics that could affect the supernova evolution too drastically; in the case of the existence of extra dimensions, and of neutrinos propagating in them, those limits seem to be very stringent if taken at face value. On another hand, even within the bounds, extra dimensions can modify SN evolution in some peculiar way, so to reveal their presence; and they could even have beneficial consequences on the flaws that SN models still present. This twofold connection is a strong motivation for the combined study of supernova evolution and neutrinos in extra dimensions.

Owing to the differing charge-to-mass ratio of ions and protons, the δ-function velocity distribution occurs naturally in that plasma. Application of the kinematic conservation laws to this case, specifically equation (14) of Jones (2014b), shows that, owing to the baryonic masses of the particles, the values of W estimated from the observed luminosities can be achieved in an ion-proton plasma.

If Γ0 contains a digon with two homotopic radii then the only diagrams that can arise are I, II, III, IV, and V. For V the procedure is the same as the one for type An, we just need to cross both the radii of the digon. For diagrams III and IV the procedure is identical to the above. For diagrams like II γ starts from the vertex opposite to the arc corresponding to the leftmost leaf and ends in the vertex of the digon not adjacent to the radii. For diagrams like I we need to distinguish two cases: if one of the leaves corresponds to a radius then the corresponding endpoint of γ is the puncture and its tagging is the opposite of the one of that radius. Otherwise we proceed as in type An.
I would like to stress at this point that we have introduced a class of solutions of field equations which are as universal as, say, solitonic solutions. We called these solutions perturbiners.

The thermodynamic signature of a first order phase transition between the disordered vortex liquid phase and the ordered vortex solid phase is the presence of a latent heat and a discontinuity in the magnetization of the system.

A few general conclusions emerge from our experiments. First, iteratively re-weighted least squares often fails to converge, especially when initialized from a poor location. As many others have observed, this reflects the numerical instability in evaluating the true Hessian matrix far away from the solution. Third, the EM algorithm is robust due to the guaranteed ascent property, but slow. Finally, the QN-EM algorithm is equally robust, but far faster. On our experiments, it usually required between 10 and 100 times fewer iterations than the basic EM to reach convergence.

In this paper, we studied the stochastic kinetics of a simple auto-regulatory signaling module with negative feedback using path-integral techniques and numerical simulations. Within our formalism, all the statistical averages and correlation functions that characterize the long-time kinetics of the system are formally expressed as a power series in the feedback parameter. Explicit expressions were obtained for mean values and correlation functions to first order in the feedback parameter. These analytical results were compared to numerical simulations. The simulations were also done in the strong feedback regime beyond the applicability of perturbation theory. In particular, we investigated how the system responds to temporal variations in an external stimulus, and how the feedback regulates this response.

The detection of fullerenes in evolved stars as common as our Sun has opened the exciting possibility that other forms of carbon such as hydrogenated fullerenes, fullerene-adducts, and multishell fullerenes (buckyonions) may be widespread in the Universe. In particular, if fullerenes and PAHs evolve from the decomposition of HACs, then both species may be mixed in the circumstellar envelopes of fullerene PNe, forming fullerene/PAHs adducts (at least with catacondensed PAHs). Our IR laboratory spectra of C60/anthracene adducts show that C60 (and C70) and other unidentified infrared emission features could also arise from fullerene-adducts.
In this work we study mechanism of the tunneling dynamics of few-boson mixtures confined to a combined triple well and harmonic trap. The harmonic trap induces spatial correlations to one species, and we explore how such correlations affect the tunneling properties of the mixture. The tunneling dynamics is qualitatively different for different the interspecies interaction regimes. In the weak interspecies interaction regime, we observe a so-called correlation-induced tunneling, and in the intermediate regime, correlated tunneling between different species is observed whereas in the strong interaction regime, higher band states come into play, and tunneling is enhanced due to an effective weakening of the optical lattice barriers.

The D0 muon detector system consists of a central muon detector system covering the range |η | <1 and forward muon systems which cover the region 1 < |η | <2. Both central and forward systems consist of a layer of drift tubes and scintillators inside toroidal magnets and two similar layers outside the toroids. Scintillation counters are included for triggering purposes and the 1.8 T toroidal iron magnets make it possible to determine muon momenta and perform tracking measurements within the muon system alone, although in general the central tracking information is also used for muon reconstruction.

Different orbits having different periods, adiabaticity depends on initial conditions. Two classes of orbits are intrinsecally non-adiabatic.

The other class is that of chaotic orbits, beacause of exponential instability.

Web architectures today suffer degradation and disruptions due to changing workloads caused by 1) time-of-day (TOD) effects; a diurnal variation in traffic on most Web sites observed throughout the day, and 2) flash crowd arrivals (FCA); an unexpected magnitude of users accessing a specific website at an unexpected time. As a result, web architectures are modified to adapt to peak workloads which results to a significant decrease in resource utilization. Hence, there is a need for web architectures allocating the optimal number of needed servers for active workloads. However, the challenge in designing an optimal resource allocation policy is to minimize server resources without affecting the user-perceived Quality of Service (QoS).
We investigate the coordinate dependence of noncommutative theory by studying the solutions of noncommutative U(1, 1) × U(1, 1) Chern-Simons theory on AdS3 in the polar and rectangular coordinates. We assume that only the space coordinates are noncommuting. The two coordinate systems are equivalent only up to first order in the noncommutativity parameter θ. We investigate the effect of this non-exact equivalence between the two coordinate systems in two cases, a conical solution and a BTZ black hole solution, using the Seiberg-Witten map. In each case, the noncommutative solutions in the two coordinate systems obtained from the corresponding same commutative solution turn out to be different even in the first order in θ.
Another example is the double-slit interference. Reasonably, we can suppose the transverse momentum of the particle is zero. The state of particles exiting an interferometer is

Thus, in order to reproduce the spectral characteristics of numerous objects (both Seyfert galaxies and GBH sources) with significant reflection the model requires an additional reflecting medium which does not contribute to the soft photon field, such as e.g. a cold outer accretion disc, reflection on a torus in the case of Seyfert galaxies or on the companion star in the case of X-ray binaries.
Basic equations of motion
The results we present in the next Section consider g ≤ 50 which, for the largest value, is roughly of the order of magnitude of the Avogrado number. The adaptation of the uniform TM procedure to take into account the node dependent interaction constant depends basically in the identification of the basic triangular units and the assembling rules that combine them when one goes from g to g + 1. A summary of the implementation of the details is provided in the Appendix.

The fraction of binaries observed among field stars (> 70% see, e.g., Abt 1983, Duquennoy & Mayor 1991, and Reipurth & Zinnecker 1993 for the frequency of binary stars among pre-main sequence stars) is larger than the fraction, hitherto detected, in clusters. The size of the difference may be partially due to observational biases: binaries should segregate to the center of the cluster and may be difficult to find on account of stellar crowding. Or fewer binaries may have formed originally, some may be depleted by collisional effects and some visible members may be swapped by exchange reactions for heavy, degenerate and invisible remnants. Many lines of inquiry (reviewed by Hut et al. 1992) are being pursued to characterize the present binary content and binary binding energy distribution within clusters.
A conventional Monte Carlo simulation involves generating a set of N samples that represent the canonical ensemble at a temperature T. From this set of samples, the mean value of any function of the energy and polarization may be found using the equation

We restrict our attention to geometrically thin, radiatively efficient, stationary accretion disks, responsible for the observed bright emission around AGNs. In this case, as gas orbits around the central object, it radiates thermal energy away much faster than the timescale over which the gas particles drift inward, and the disk maintains a thin configuration. Radiatively efficient disks are the most massive among accretion disks, as the mass accretion rate is largest and the inward drift velocity is smallest. For lower radiative efficiencies around quiescent SMBHs, accretion is described by other models, such as advection-domination, which we ignore here.

In addition, while the innermost regions of early-type galaxies are expected to be dominated by the stellar mass component, the dark-matter mass component is usually found to play a non-negligible role, with mass fractions ranging from 10 to 40 per cent of the total mass within one effective radius (e.g. Gerhard et al. 2001; Cappellari et al. 2006; Gavazzi et al. 2007; Weijmans et al. 2008). Even more recently, observations, as well as theoretical studies based on stellar population and dynamical models (e.g. Bullock et al. 2001, Padmanabhan et al. 2004), indicate that, for a constant IMF, the dark matter fraction in the internal region increases monotonically with the mass of the galaxy (e.g. Zaritsky et al. 2006; Auger et al. 2010), a trend that is more conspicuous in the case of slow-rotator ellipticals (Tortora et al. 2009). On the other hand, it has also been shown that the luminous stellar mass-to-light ratio scales with the luminous mass of the system (Grillo et al 2010). However, information from stellar kinematics is limited to the central regions (a few effective radii) because of the lack of bright kinematic tracers at large radii, and the total mass determination suffers from the well-known degeneracy between the mass density profile of the galaxy and the anisotropy of its stellar velocity dispersion tensor (Binney & Mamon 1982). Higher-order velocity moments, which potentially allow one to disentangle this degeneracy by providing additional constraints (Gerhard 1993; van der Marel & Franx 1993), can only be measured with sufficient accuracy in the inner parts of nearby galaxies with current instruments. Despite great progress, it still remains difficult to separate the stellar and dark-matter components, mostly due to a still relatively poor understanding of the precise shape of the stellar IMF and its associated stellar mass-to-light ratio. Uncertainties related to the latter can easily lead to a factor of a few uncertainty in the inferred stellar mass.

In the binary lensing, the lensing system composed of two objects. These objects can be either (a) a binary star or (b) a star with its companion planet or (c) any other combination of sufficiently high mass objects, such as black holes, brown dwarfs, etc. Increasing the number of lenses from one to two or more objects increases dramatically the complication of the lensing equation. One of the features of having multiple lensing is the caustic lines on the source plane. Once a source crosses these lines, in theory we have infinite magnification and in the observation, we can get sparks of light from the source object. In the case of binary lensing, either source star or planet orbiting around it or both objects can cross the caustic lines. The advantage of using binary lensing for detecting planet is that with an early warning system, from the deviation of light curve from the single lensing, we can identify an ongoing binary microlensing event before the light curve peaks. We will show that the probability of high magnification of planet in binary lensing is more than a typical single lens.
This procedure is continued until we arrive at the last candidate vr. Here, we have

The influence of the magnetic field on the dynamical flow of the infalling plasma around a compact object and on the emergent radiation spectrum have long been realized in the theoretical study of very high energy astrophysical objects like pulsars, quasars, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries. Unfortunately no convincing theory has been well established so far which can explain the radiation from these sources consistently and correctly. Though the definite mechanism has not been understood properly, it is generally believed that the radiation emission could be due to the plasma processes near compact objects like neutron stars and black holes. Thus it becomes necessary to consider plasma processes in intense-gravitational-field backgrounds, as such compact objects would be massive enough to produce significant spacetime curvature effects. Therefore one has to consider the dynamics of the fluid in curved spacetime which is quite an involved problem since one requires to solve the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics equations.

The Common Due-Date (CDD) scheduling problem involves sequencing and scheduling of jobs over machine(s) against a common due-date. Each job possesses a processing time and different penalties per unit time in case the job is completed before or later than the due-date. The objective of the problem is usually to schedule the jobs so as to get the least total penalty due to earliness or tardiness of all the jobs. In practice, a common due date occurs in almost any manufacturing industry and its goal is to reduce both, the earliness and tardiness of the goods produced. Earliness of the produced goods is not desired because it requires the maintenance of some stocks leading to some expenses to the industry for storage cost, tied-up capital with no cash flow etc. On the other hand, a tardy job leads to customer dissatisfaction.

Let us now discuss the dynamical aspects of trajectories in phase space and how these trajectories are organized in terms of the manifolds of the fixed points of the system under study. Each saddle fixed point presents four manifolds. Two of them are stable (attractive), in sense that trajectories on them converge asymptotically to the saddle point, and two are unstable (repulsive), where ICs generate trajectories that diverge from the saddle point. Each manifold is constructed using the direction of the eigenvectors η at the saddle point, obtained from the expression Jη = Λη.
Here we shall derive the local factorization and commutativity relations which underlie the factorization of the general transfer matrix and its commutativity.
We require all these constraints to be such that if in any of these equations three of the four entries are given the fourth will be uniquely determined.

Summary and Discussion- We have proposed a window measurement scheme, which practically solves severe finite-size and finite-time effects. The correction-to-scaling terms sometimes cause discrepancies in the final result of scaling analyses. They can be made very small by scaling the window data with the window correlation length. We can also combine equilibrium data of small sizes and nonequilibrium data of large sizes into one scaling analysis. It is a great advantage in the slow-dynamic systems.
