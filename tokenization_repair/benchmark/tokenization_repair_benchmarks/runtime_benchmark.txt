In many experiments on polarization entanglement between two l)h_oons generated from down conversion, it is common to take into account only those data where two (or more) pho-tons were detected, (at least) one on each side A a n d B, and ignore the null results where pho-tons were not detected on both sides. For Quinten this is a correct procedure, one reason being it relies only on th e fair-sampling assumption. Another way to see that this procedure is correct, is to note it can be simulated by a local filtering operation. We may imagine on each side independently am" polarization-independent lossy channel, then a quantum-non-demolition (QND) measurement of photon n u m b e r , and filtering out those cases where no photons are found. Here one would use the relation
As F(n, g) is injective at Γ un-der our assumptions, it suffices to show that the induced map on Zariski tangent spaces is an isomorphism. We will use the following local criterion:

We administered the FCI at the beginning and end of every second semester from AY 2011-12 to AY 2014-15. All student answers for each question were recorded and an item analysis was performed with emphasis on the six polarisation-inducing questions. Standard statistical parameters for the four-year data wei'e\ calculated including p-value f o r t-test, mean, standard deviation,percent difference, etc. Using these parameters, (a) student performance from pretest to posttest, (b) possible gender difference in overall FCI, (c) existence of polarisation, (d) possi-ble gender difference in the polarization-inducing questions, among others, were analysed.

Another observation is that the results with K = 100 are not the best for the TREC 6 and the TREC 7 topic sets. The results with K = 100 show marginal improvements. Surprisingly, th e single-point representation of the documents produces bet-ter resultsthan with K = 100.
Information and decisionare closely linked and different methods exist to take a decision on the basis of imperfect information.

From the other hand, we then briefly analyze the characteristics and lacks of existing methods methods using both MCDA methods and theories for uncertainty management.

Software diversification is a probabilistic technique that uses code and data randomization and expressive-ness in thcovee tar-get instruction set to generate large amounts of functionally equivalent but different binaries. Malware diversity builds on software diversity and ensure s that any two diversified instances of thesame malware have low similarity (according to a set of similarity metrics). An LLVM-based prototype implementation diversifies both code and data of binaries and our evaluation shows that signatures based on similarity only match one or few instances in a pool of diversified binaries generated from the same source code.

Table 4 summarizes the result of fitting the various Iron l i n e models to the BeppoSAX d a t a set. As rep ort ed b y Guainazzi et al. (1999) the standard disk model fits the data well. Like the ASCA results the inclination angle i s well co ns tra i n e d to be i ≈ 35o and constraining i =10 o requires an additional Gaussian line (Table 4: column 2 and 3). The double zonemodel also fits the data well but the inner line producingregion is somewhat smaller than the ASCA results (Ro1 ≈ 6.2rg).

As soon as s seesr set to C, it starts moving toward it ofler turnIng A, if s is also set to C and not coincident with r), covering atleast δ at each Move phase, until their distance becomes less than δ and s finally reaches r.

Magnetars a re neot~on stars (NSs) whose energy budget is dominated by dissipation of electric cur-rents supporting magnetic fields. Known objects of this type have stron~ fields: poloidal (in particular, dipo-lar) or/and toroidal. The origin of these strong fields is still not clear.
It is straightforward to solve the equations in the appendix for the three cases described l)w;,l We collect these results here and look at a special case in slightly more detail. The appendix contains three equations which assume that R1, R2, R3 are non-zero. We will solve for three quantities in terms of the remaining undetermined quantities.
More surprisingly, a similar structure is also appearing at higher orders.
As all faces have 1)ositivc circulation in clockwise direction,the total sum remains nonzero. Now, observe that if the cy-cle C goes through the subtree Ti, then its projection in r(T), say Ci, must contain at least one of thefaces adjacent to t ile p air/t i p l\ el, in r(T), at which Ti is connected. Since, circulation of this face is 2UTi, contribution from this component will su r pass the total sum of all the subtrees where C passes through.
from herewe can show that the net result is that there is a covariant derivative given by
If we have asequence of times ti → t, we can extract a L22 strongly convergent subsequence, and the limit must be a solution for time t.

The last property corresponds to fixed points where host of intermediate defense levelare not present.

The ghost propagators are not useful in the order we are working.The above propagators were written for generic gauge parameters: ξh and ξγ. Since our interest is in the study of gauge independent quantities, from now on, we will restrict to the Feynman gauges, ξh = ξγ = 1, which simplifies the very longcalculations involved. Reproduction of the same re-sults by calculating with generic parameters ξh and ξγ would be desirable, but we will leave it for future investigations.

Of course, a big advantage of this model is that he underlying bosonic part is just a linear Klein-Gordon equation, so we do not have solitonic phenomenology. We can do absolutely the same machinery for a nonlinear completely integrable bosonic equation with rich solitonic phenomenology. For instance, we consider a fermionic extension of the Boussinesq equation

The results of spectroscopic study of Ae Herbig star RR Tau are reported. The observations were carried out with a mod-erate resolution. In accordance with the presenteddata the Hα line exhibits a double-peaked emission profile. The b lu e component is weaker than or equal to the redone. Variations of the Hα equiva-lent width by a factor of 4 - 5 were found. The structure of this line also varies. OnJD 2447148 a red absorption reversalof the Hα profile was observed. The Hβ spectral line exhibited both emission and absorption. On JD 2449664 the single-peak emission shifted to the short wavelength range of the ol~derIaling absorption line and the red wing of the stellar line looked like a red-shifted absorption component of medium strength. The Hδ line was in absorption. KEYWORDS Xoungcars, H(;rbig ?e"Be stars, spectroscopic observations

In the next phase, we select for every v i r t ual address α ∈ {0, 1} two landmark nodes xα · 0, xα · 1 from theconnected sub-network Gα. Here α · 0 and α · 1 is the extension of α by symbol 0 or 1, respectively. Landmark node xα · 0 is one of the nodes of network Gα that has maximum ω-distance to xα in sub-network Gα, and landmark node xα · 1 is one of the nodes of network Gα that has maximum ω-distance to xα · 0 in sub-network Gα. A node u of Gα whose ω-distance to xα · 0 is les~ than or equal to t he ω - d i s t a n ce b e t w e en u and xα · 1 gets virtual address α · 0.

About 3% of all known white dwarfs have strong mag-netic fields between 106 and 109 Gauss (Wickramasinghe & Ferrario 2000, Jordan 2001). The de-tailed surface structure of the magnetic field can be inferred from time-resolved spectro-polarimetric observations, which give integrals of the polarized radiation over the stellar surface visible at a given rotational phase. Because the magnetic field varies in strength and direction, theoretical calculations for polarized radiative transfer have to be performed at many (typically 1000) different points on the surface. In order to ensure numerical accuracy and efficiency, we have tested four different methods from the literature for solving the radiative transfer (,hquat~-osin magnetized whitedwarf atmespheres. Note that the ALI (Accelerated Λ-Iteration) method is described in more detail by Deetjen et al. in these proceedings.

However, other possible interpretations of the MACHO r es ults have been proposed in order\ to avoid the disiicu'lt~s associated with a large halo population of white dwarfs. The mass estimate for the lenses depends upon the assumed phase space distribution of MACHOs. There are large uncertainties in the halo model parameters, incudi, the distribution and velocity structure of the dark matter, and attempts have been madeto exploit these uncertainties in etc1"/ to obtain mass es-timates from the current data that are consistent with lenses in the substellar regime (e.g. brown dwarfs). Previous work by the authors and others have exam-ined a wide range of halo models, including ftattened halos, halos with a bulk rotational component to the velocity structure (Gyuk & G a t es 1 9 9 8) a n d halos with anisotropic velocity dispersions (Gyuk, Evans, & Gates 1998). These analyseshave shown that for a n y reasonable (smoothly varying) phase space distribution of the lenses, the implied lens mass is still much larger l;han the hydrogen burning limit, and thus one cannot appeal to modeling uncertainties in order to in-voke brown dwarfs as candidates for the MACHOs.

Theχ2 is flat as a function of mt unless Rb and/or the directly measured in Fermilab mass of the top quark are included into the fit. These are the only t w o measured observables which in the present case introduce visible χ2 dependence as a function of mt and can, therefore, put indirectly (by constraining mt) relevant overall limit on the Higgs mass Mh. This is also clearly seen in Fig.1.
Let us also remark that the eigenvalue of the function fis equal to the squared distance between (0, 0) and ν(f). This observation completes the proof.

This holds for spe-cial relativity as we ll as for general relativity. Special relativity shares with Newtonian mechanics one (:ruqIal point: inertial coordinates are distinguished from all others (i. e. from non-inertial reference frames), and the laws of physics are said to hold only relative to inertial coordinate systems. It is often argued that general relativity puts away any worries over inertial ref-erence frames insofar as it nu ll ifie s the privileged status of inertial reference frames. Inertial and uniformly accelerated motions are equivalent. However, the statement that all reference frames, rather than just inertial frames, are equivalent is misleading. Rather, thevariable curvature of space-time makes the imposition of a global inertial frame impossible. Any space-time obeying the general theory of re l a t iv c i ty and thus accounting for gravitation will be ll)c?al1y Minkowskian in the sense that a n y infinitesimal region of space-time has an inertial frame obeying the prin-ciples of special relativity.

Other general commonsense knowledge is built on top of this naive topolog'y. The domain of time is seen as a particular kind of scale defined by change of state, and the axiomatization builds toward such predicates as "regular" and "persist". The domain of belief has three principal subclusters in this application: learning, which includes such predicates as "find", "test" and "manifest"; reasoning, explicating predicates such as "leads-to" and "consistent"; and classifying, with such predicates as "distinguish", "dif-ferentiate" and "identify". The domain of modalities expli- cates such concepts as necessity, possibility, and likelihood.
In particular the TIES system is described in section4.1, while the approach based on kernel methods isdiscussed in section 4.2.

We describe a generative probabilistic model of natural an- guage, which we call HBG, that takes advantage of detailed linguistic information to resolve ambiguity. HBG incorpo-rates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way. We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Tree-bank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence. This stands in contrast o the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection i the hope of generating the correct parse. In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabflistic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG, increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error.

3. PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR
A set of SAIL programs has been implemented for analyzing large bodies of natural language data in which associations exist between strings and sets of strings. These programs include facilities for compiling information such as frequency of occurrence of strings (e.g. word frequencies) or substrings (e.g. consonant cluster frequencies), and describing relationships among strings (e.g. various phono-logical realizations af a word). Also, an associative data base may be interactively accessed on the basis of keys corresponding to different types of data elements, and a pattern matcher allows retrieval of incompletely specified elements. Applications Of this natural language processing package include analysis of phonological variation for speci-fying and testing phonological rules, and comparison across languages for historical reconstruction.

I lL LEARNING AND RECOGNITION PIIASES
We separate the problem of FrameNet tagging into three subsequent processes: 1) sentence segmentation 2) frame element identification, and 3) semantic role tagging. We assume the frame element (FE) boundaries match the parse constituents, so we segment a sentence based on parse constituents. We consider steps 2) and 3) as classification problems. In frame element identification, we use a binary classifier to determine if each parse constituent is a FE or not, while, in semantic role tagging, we classify each 1 http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~framenet identified FE into its appropriate semantic role.2

APPENDIX. COMPUTATIONAL, DATA, AND STORAGE REQUIREMENTS It is important to point out at the outset hat he fast computing that is needed for research in spoken language systems does not defive so much from the need to achieve real-time with compute-intensive algofithms, for, given a particular algorithm, it has always been possible to build special-purpose hardware to perform the computations in real-time.

Given an instance of ambiguous prepositional phrase attachment from the test set, the lexical association pro-cedure for guessing attachments u ed the t-score \[Church et aL, 1991\] to assess the direction and significance of the difference between Pr(p\[n 1) and Pr(plv) - - t will be positive, zero, or negative according to whether Pr(pln 1) is greater, equal to, or less than Pr(plv), respectively, and its magnitude indicates the level of confidence in the significance of this difference.
For the relations, fire units stand for characteristics of the relation itself Note that this differs from most other approaches in treating each role or relation as a distributed pattern. This has several virtues. For one thing, it immediately eliminates the problem of specifying a small set of case roles, in the face of the fact that there seem to he a very large number of very subtle differences between roles that are in many ways very similar. Further, the use of distributed representations allows us to capture both the similarities and differences among case roles. The idea has been proposed on independent linguistic grounds, as well.

In the first part of this paper, we present ourtool: a shallow?parser compiler. In a secondpart, we present output samples as well asseveral evaluations for French and for English,where the tool has been used to develop both anNP?chunker and a richer shallow?parser. Wealso explain why our approach is more tolerantto POS?tagging errors. Finally, we discusssome other practical uses which are made of thisshallow?parser compiler.

For words ending in superheavy syllables too, alternation exists only between R(egular) and I(rregular) patterns. The regular ones (final stress) are predicted with 96.80% accuracy for Encoding 2 and 96.35% for Encoding 3. The irregular patterns reach success cores of 55.83% for Encoding 2 and 61.67% for Encoding 3, again yield-ing a highly significant difference.

The tagger has three kinds of knowledge: abase lexicon, contextual rules and lexical rules.
The goal here is to provide an automatic process that can take advantage of the large degree of similarity frequently found between different rules in a unification grammar by overlap-ping their storage or execution paths. While the modularity and declarative nature of such a grammar are well-served by representing each of a family of related possibilities with its own rule, storing and testing and instantiating each role sep-arately can be quite expensive. If common rule segments could be automatically identified, they could be partially merged, reducing both the storage space for them and the computational cost of matching against hem.

The file-type table simply tells M-COOL whether the given knowledge source is lexical or semantic, and whether it is for generation or analysis. It also supplies miscellaneous information such as the name of the file where the run-time entries are kept and whether it can be compiled using the LISP compile command. For example, our Spanish-lexical-analysis file-type is defined with this entry:

It consists of only 48 tags. 13 There is no attempt to annotate compound words, so there are no ditto tags.

We then augmented OSTIA with three kinds of learning biases, which are specific to natural language phonology, and are assumed explicitly or implicitly by every the-ory of phonology: faithfulness (underlying segments tend to be realized similarly on the surface), community (similar segments behave similarly), and context (phonolog-ical rules need access to variables in their context). These biases are so fundamental to generative phonology that they are left implicit in many theories. But explicitly modifying the OSTIA algorithm with these biases allowed it to learn more compact, accurate, and general transducers, and our implementation successfully earns a num-ber of rules from English and German. The algorithm is also successful in learning the composition of multiple rules applied in series. The more difficult problem of decom-posing the learned underlying/surface correspondences into simple, individual rules remains unsolved.

The questions, "what class does a verb belong to?", "what are the relative frequencies of the dif-ferent patterns it occurs in?", and "is this pattern grammaticalT' are intimately connected. Alterna-tion behaviour is a major source of evidence as to how a verb should be classified, and grammaticality judgements are premised upon the patterns a com-petent speaker has frequently encountered in their experience of the language. The further develop-ment of computational lexical semantics of the kind described in this paper requires foundational work on the relation of corpus-based statistical findings to formal knowledge representation.

We can also look at candidates with motions of somewhat lower significance. In this paper, we examined the 110 stars which had Stot > 5.0. There were 72 stars with 4.0 ≤ Stot < 5.0, and they show nearly the same degree of asymmetry in their motions as our first sample. It is likely that a significant number of these stars have real proper motions. However, it will take extra effort to distinguish them from the growing number of false detections, and to check their photometry (many of them are fainter than the stars in our sample). As we sift through this set of stars with less significant motions, we can also try to improve the B and V measurements of our stars, so that we will not discard so many candidates due to their uncertain colors.

In the solar wind the body of the spacecraft provides a barrier to the bulk flow. Directly downstream of the spacecraft a wake is formed that contains large electric fields, which dominate the signal and are measured each time one of the EFI probes enters the wake. The wake shows up as large discontinuous jumps in the time series making it possible to automatically detect and remove these periods. Approximately 30% of the data points are removed by this process.

The situation becomes somewhat more interesting when in addition to xm one more direction is compactified. For instance, consider a 2 + 1-dimensional configuration where both spacial directions are compactified. The dimensional reduction on the mth (now m = 2) direction yields a 1 + 1-dimensional system where the spacial coordinate is compactified on a circle of length l1 .

The ghost propagators are not useful in the order we are working.The above propagators were written for generic gauge parameters: ξh and ξγ . Since our interest is in the study of gauge independent quantities, from now on, we will restrict to the Feynman gauges, ξh = ξγ = 1, which simplifies the very long calculations involved. Reproduction of the same results by calculating with generic parameters ξh and ξγ would be desirable, but we will leave it for future investigations.

They first look for potential suffixes by searching for frequent word-final substrings. Then, they look for potentially morphologically related pairs, i.e., pairs that end in potential suffixes and share the left substring preceding those suffixes. Finally, they look, among those pairs, for those whose semantic vectors (computed using latent semantic analysis) are significantly correlated. In short, the idea behind the semantic component of their model is that words that tend to co-occur with the same set of words, within a certain window of text, are likely to be semantically correlated words.

The shape of a rotation curve is determined largely by the distrbution of luminous and dark mass contained in a spiral galaxy. The correlation found between pitch angle and shear rate, therefore suggests that the main factor determing the tightness of spiral structure, is in fact the central mass concentration. Essentially, a declining rotation curve is indicative of a large central bulge. The correlation between mass concentration and spiral arm pitch angle has been suggested by many theoretical models (e.g. Fuchs 1991, 2000; Bertin et al. 1989a, b; Bertin & Lin 1996).

The ratio of detections to sites with 6035-MHz emission was 8 out of 38, while for the 1720-MHz it was 2 out of 12, both of which also have 6035-MHz emission. This draws into doubt the claimed predictive power of 1720-MHz, though with few detections the statistics are not compelling.

A hallmark of scientific reasoning and experimentation has been the exploration of different hypotheses in order to better understand phenomena. With more computational steps and a wider array of rapidly evolving software, the ability to understand and control computational research often relies on understanding different, often-complex interfaces. In some cases, this complexity has led to more rigid workflows where exploration is more limited. Finally, while scripts and other tools can help integrate such workflows, the responsibility for tracking changes and linking results to the steps used is often left to the scientist. Both education and improvements in software can help address these issues, and they often require collaboration between scientists and software architects.

It has been proposed that relativistic kinematics considerations necessitate that the Thomas precession gives rise to certain forces that resemble the rotational pseudoforces known as the Coriolis, Euler, and centrifugal forces. It has been shown to order v 2 /c2 that the predicted anti-Coriolis force of the Thomas precession accounts for the existence of the magnetic force. The possible correspondence of the strong nuclear force to an anti-centrifugal force of the Thomas procession was investigated.

Firstly, the average of 32 samples before the arrival of the pulse was used to estimate the baseline mean value, as well as the baseline RMS for each channel, defining the noise. The baseline mean value was subtracted from all samples, shifting the average baseline to zero. The amplitude is obtained as the maximum value of the signal.

Basic Properties
The transit and the stellar signal cannot be separated effectively if they overlap too much in the frequency domain. Because of this, commonly used pre-detections stellar variability filters, such as the NIF, alter the transit signal, causing systematic errors in the resulting star and planet parameters. We have quantified this effect using 20 CoRoT BT2 simulated light curves including transits, instrumental noise and stellar variability. We found that the effect on the transit signal can be very significant, leading to errors on the star-planet radius ratio up to 50%.
There are some difficulties with this decomposition, though, and maybe this is a good place to make the reader aware of them.

PAIRITEL determines the observing schedule using an intelligent queuing database which incorporates new observations into a dynamic scheduling system, while accounting for recently acquired observations. Software components must also rely upon cross communication. For example, a monitor of the transmission, acquisition/reduction software, and telescope pointing need complex interactions to maximize observing efficiency.

The eccentricity distribution depends on whether the planet has a smaller or larger semi-major axis than its parent star. In the case of smaller semi-major axis, the eccentricity distribution is centered at lower eccentricity relative to the parent star, while in the case of larger semi-major axis the eccentricity distribution is centered at higher eccentricity relative to the parent star. In 95% of the runs of set A the eccentricity of the planet orbit ep differs less than 15% from the eccentricity of its parent star es .

The complete p-elliptic integrals and a computation formula of πp for p = 4
From the wedge product, we can define a measure of entanglement for a general pure bipartite quantum system Qp2 (N1 , N2 ) as
The above analysis demonstrates that the magnetic force can be interpreted as a relativistic-kinematic consequence of the acceleration of the test particle by the Coulomb force, and the relative motion of the field-source and test particles.
For q = 0 we simply obtain
When using ADI, the position angle (PA) of North in the individual NICI images are recorded in the FITS image headers at the beginning of the integrations. However, since the instrument rotator is turned off, over the course of an individual integration (1 min), the PA changes. We compute the PA value corresponding to the middle of the integration and add it to the FITS headers. This corrected PA is used later when de-rotating the individual images to a common orientation.

Although one could consider this situation in the frames of the hydrodynamic nulear model, it does not appear when we study the real neutron stars. Therefore, except for the main transition region, the solution is determined by equation

The statistical consequences of interaction
Due to their large luminosity and SEDs often reaching the highest observed γ-ray energies, blazars are the most powerful and most energetic cosmic accelerators known.
